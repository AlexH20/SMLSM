2016-01-04 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.5867541785200323,0.2195624581067805,-0.0008975054569901,with apple  iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales not coming in as robustly as the company and its investors might have hoped the idevice maker is going to need to pull out all the stops with its next generation iphones likely to be called iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus respectively. here are three features that i believe apple must  include in the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in order to remain competitive with what i believe next generation android flagships will have. optical image stabilization for the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple launched the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus the latter came with optical image stabilization for still images while its smaller counterpart did not. then with the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the latter gained support for optical image stabilization for video while the smaller model like its predecessor offered neither. in order for the iphone 00NUMBER00 to continue to offer a class leading camera subsystem compared to the top android phones i believe that apple must add optical image stabilization to the device. ideally the iphone 00NUMBER00 will support this feature in both still images and video although it wouldnt be surprising to see apple add it for still images in the 00NUMBER00 and for videos in the 00NUMBER00 though this would probably be a mistake from a competitive perspective. greater pixel density for the iphone 00NUMBER00 common criticism of the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 is that compared to other flagship phones it sports a relatively low pixel density of just 00NUMBER00 pixels per inch. anybody who has used either the iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 as well as the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 will probably be able to tell you that there is a very noticeable difference in the sharpness between the two phones. with low cost android smartphones now packing very sharp displays 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 resolution is becoming very common even in mid range android devices for example it would practically be a sin for apple to continue to use a 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 on the next generation iphone 00NUMBER00. now the challenge apple faces is that displays with more pixels consume more power. apple aims to make each successive smartphone generation thinner and lighter than the previous one if possible which limits the companys ability to increase battery size in future iphones. however figuring out how to make higher resolution better looking and more power efficient displays is what apples engineers as well as those at the display makers that apple works so closely with are paid to figure out. although i would also like to see a sharper display for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus its probably not as imperative. the key thing that apple does need to work on with the display for the 00NUMBER00 though is to make sure that color accuracy and contrast actually match those on the iphone 00NUMBER00 display something it didnt quite achieve with the 00NUMBER00 family of phones. a much more competitive camera subsystem    with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus apple introduced a new camera subsystem adding a much higher resolution 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensor up from the 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensor used in the prior generation iphone lineup. interestingly though according to dxomark the cameras on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are actually inferior  to those found on a number of top android phones such as the nexus 00NUMBER00 lg 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge. furthermore per the test there was no improvement in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cameras relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. given that best in class camera performance has been somewhat of a hallmark of the iphone camera it is a little distressing to see that apple isnt leading here. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus i would hope to see apple move up to the top of the rankings compared to its competition particularly if it wants to continue to keep seeing android owners switch to iphone over time. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is

ipad into more than just a consumption device. the ipad pro brought with it a number of substantial technical enhancements across the board compared to the previous ipad flagship the ipad air 00NUMBER00. interestingly although apple chose to quietly update the ipad mini alongside the launch of the ipad pro apple didnt update the ipad air lineup at the event. the next generation ipad air widely referred to as the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is instead expected to debut at a product launch event in the spring 00NUMBER00. i believe that the launch timing of the next generation ipad air suggests that it will be a fairly substantial update. heres why. a simple chip upgrade would have been well simple    if apple were planning to do a simple improvement of the ipad air 00NUMBER00 over the ipad air 00NUMBER00 by say upgrading just the processor and maybe a few other internal components then i think apple could have pulled off a launch alongside the ipad mini 00NUMBER00. indeed with ipad sales growth in dire need of all the help that it can get it would make sense that if it could apple would have rolled out a newer ipad air as soon as possible. this then seems to suggest that we could see some pretty significant improvements with the next generation ipad air. what kinds of improvements could we see    to get a sense of the scope of the improvements that we could see with the ipad air 00NUMBER00 its worthwhile to examine the improvements that apple brought to the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 to get a sense of where apple might go with the ipad air 00NUMBER00. the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 brought an entirely new and quite excellent display a more capable processor faster wireless and a revamped industrial design. the display on the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is widely believed to be the same one thats used in the ipad air so this is certainly overdue for an update. an upgrade from the 00NUMBER00 to either the 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00  probably the 00NUMBER00 in my view would be quite nice. with the ipad mini apple stuck with the same industrial design for two product generations in a row so id be surprised to see the company revamp the industrial design with the ipad air 00NUMBER00. additionally the ipad mini lineup had been saddled with quite outdated wireless capabilities for quite some time while the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is still quite current on that front so im not convinced well see an upgrade there either. one area where i would like to see a significant improvement though is the camera. there has generally been a significant gap between the quality of the camera subsystem that apple puts onto its ipads and onto its iphones in favor of the latter and the delta between the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is no exception. although i wouldnt suggest that apple go all out and put an iphone class camera on the next generation ipad air this wouldnt make sense for a whole bunch of reasons i do think that a superior camera on the next generation ipad air could help to serve as a compelling selling point. given that ipad unit shipments have been in free fall for quite some time which many attribute to users simply hanging onto their older ipads for longer any and all selling points would be quite welcome at this point. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that

00NUMBER00 as a whole which was marked by some major volatility. earnings reports announcements and product launches all at times dominated the narrative surrounding the firm. lets take a look at some of the most significant positive headlines that benefited apple shareholders in 00NUMBER00. the largest quarterly profit in history   in january apple turned in what may have been its best earnings report ever. the mac maker brought in 00NUMBER00 billion  the best quarterly profit in corporate history on nearly 00NUMBER00 in sales. demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus was extraordinary and apple sold 00NUMBER00 million smartphones. the company enjoyed a record rate of android switchers and its chinese revenue surged to an all time high. reinventing the laptop and entering the streaming market    apple unveiled two major new products in the first half of the year. in march it announced the new macbook and in june it launched apple music. neither was a major contributor to apples earnings in 00NUMBER00 nor are they likely to be at any point in the near future but both served important strategic functions for apples broader ecosystem of devices and services. the macbook represents apples vision of the future of traditional computing. its weak processor and lack of ports attracted a fair amount of criticism but its slim profile and light weight earned quite a bit of praise. most importantly it served to underscore apples commitment to continued innovation. for most consumers other macbook models likely offer a better experience but the new macbook seems to perfectly encapsulate the future of the mac business as a whole. apple music was arguably the opposite. the service offers some innovative features its competitors struggle to match but when apple music launched in june it was several years late to the streaming subscription music business. still its deep integration with ios devices gives it an advantage and apple managed to rack up over 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers by october. for a company whose resurgence was built on digital music apple music is vital to ensuring the firm remains a relevant player in the industry. debuting in second place    apples first wearable the apple watch made its sales debut in april. but its success was far from guaranteed and reviews of the device were at best lukewarm. apple management was optimistic about the product but hasnt released sales figures and isnt planning to at least not regularly. the best news for the apple watch may have come in august when research firm idc released its second quarter report on the state of the wearables market. according to idc apple sold the second most wearables of any firm from april to june a significant milestone given that it was the first quarter during which the apple watch was available for purchase. idc followed that report with one showing apple maintaining its second place status in the third quarter. fitbit  remained no. 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 sets a new record    given that they were the first iphones to sport larger displays the record demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus was far from surprising. but the fate of their successors  the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus was less certain. would consumers be equally enthusiastic given their nearly identical form factors in september investors were given some insight when apple reported a blockbuster debut weekend. apple sold 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus units the first weekend they were available handily beating the 00NUMBER00 million iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus units it sold during their first weekend 00NUMBER00. the apple tv and ipad pro finally arrive    for apple the second half of the year was dominated by the launch of two new products that while they were technically based on existing models represented entirely new platforms. the fourth generation apple tv made its debut in late october. with a redesigned remote and access to the app store the new apple tv is much closer to a true smart tv platform than its predecessor. offerings remain limited but games such as guitar hero  and skylanders  are available as are some streaming apps including plex that the old apple tv lacked. at first glance the ipad pro is simply a giant ipad. but when paired with its optional keyboard cover and the apple pencil it becomes much more of a productivity device. the number of apps that take advantage of the ipad pros additional screen real estate and accessories is limited but a growing base of users should eventually attract developers. it could also help rejuvenate apples declining ipad business. neither product is likely to drive significant revenue for apple in the near term but they represent two new categories the company can increasingly participate in over time. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in

opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  we might be just a few months away from a 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 launch. a recent presentation from china mobile  showed a schedule revealing an april launch date for an upcoming apple device which coincides with other reports that apple is set to launch a new 00NUMBER00 inch phone in the spring. but while the rumors are flying about the 00NUMBER00 you can read all about them here   one question remains will this device have any significant impact for appleif we look at the price points apple currently sells its devices for the margins it has for its iphones and its strategy for the emerging markets it appears the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 may not change much for the company. new phone same traits    business insider recently published  some thoughts that piper jaffray  analyst gene munster shared over the summer about the 00NUMBER00 inch iphonethe reality is that whether the device is real or not doesnt matter. we would not expect apple to sell significantly more iphone 00NUMBER00 devices than the typical low end model currently the 00NUMBER00 and would also not expect margins to be significantly different. lets take a moment to dissect both arguments in this statement. munster says we cant expect apple to sell more 00NUMBER00 than it does 00NUMBER00 devices right now. why because that would clearly eat into apples more expensive iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 models as well as its older but still expensive 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 devices. the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 is expected to cost between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 which is lower than the 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 that sells 00NUMBER00 off contract or the 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 which sells for 00NUMBER00 contract. none of this is earth shattering news of course because the iphone 00NUMBER00 sells for 00NUMBER00 without a contract. this simply puts the iphone 00NUMBER00 right around the same price point as apples cheapest iphone offering which seems logical. now about those margins. if apple priced the new 00NUMBER00 much lower than the 00NUMBER00 then it might convince lots of users to buy the cheaper device and thus hurt the iphones average selling price asp lower its margins and eventually hurt its revenue. but pricing the 00NUMBER00 at the same price as the 00NUMBER00 apples asps and allows the company to maintain its current margins. why apple is likely to play it safe    theres been a lot of talk that the iphone 00NUMBER00 could be a device aimed at the emerging markets. but i dont think that approach fits in with how apples targeted the emerging markets so far. the company has released older versions of its devices like the 00NUMBER00 into india and other countries and sold them for cheaper prices. but it hasnt created a specific  emerging market iphone. some people wanted the 00NUMBER00 to be that device but it wasnt priced low enough to be a truly emerging market phone which typically costs hundreds of dollars less than apples cheapest phone. the fact is that apple isnt likely to voluntarily contract the wide margins it earns from its premium devices. instead it seems best to assume that the company will continue to target emerging markets with older devices like the 00NUMBER00. the company already slashed the price of the 00NUMBER00 in india from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 you want to read why iphones are more expensive in india than other countries which puts its much closer to the android devices that it competes against in the south asian country. apple isnt trying to disrupt the emerging markets with a new phone and it probably doesnt need to. it can sell older devices at cheaper prices in india and other places and maintain its high margins in the u. s. china and elsewhere. its worked well for apple so far and i doubt the company wants to change much now. the 00NUMBER00 will likely become the cheapest option in the u. s. and other rich markets while 00NUMBER00 will continue being sold as the main iphone for emerging markets. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot

2016-01-05 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.5738383551084167,0.2195624581067805,-0.001059567394725,samsung  hasnt been at the top of its wearable game to say the least. the company introduced its first smartwatch the galaxy gear back in 00NUMBER00 to terrible reviews. it followed that up with the gear 00NUMBER00 which runs the companys own tizen software instead of android but that device hasnt fared much better. meanwhile apple  only entered the wearable tech space nine months ago and its already dominating the competition and outpacing samsung. according to data  from idc apple shipped 00NUMBER00 million smartwatches in 00NUMBER00 while samsung shipped just 00NUMBER00 million tizen powered units. though theres still time for samsung to bounce back in the smartwatch space it appears the korean conglomerate is taking a different approach to the wearable market making processors for other companies devices. the company recently debuted its new bio processor for fitness trackers which could be the beginning of samsungs biggest wearable tech opportunity yet. image source samsung. what the bio processor does    the companys new bio processor is designed to power fitness trackers that measure body fat skeletal muscle mass heart rate skin temperature and stress levels. whats noteworthy about the chip is that when implemented into wearable devices it could improve the level of health tracking currently available. for example apple has touted the fitness tracking aspect of its apple watch yet it really only has the ability to track a users heart rate. samsung says that its bio processor can process five different biometric signals is the most versatile health and fitness monitoring chip available on the market today and is expected to open up many new health based service options for our customers. how it could help samsung    the company could keep this bio processor all to itself put in the next iteration of the gear smartwatch or fitness tracker and call it a day. but instead samsung has set up several reference platforms for other companies to demonstrate how it can be used. they include a wristband board and a patch which the company says can be used to demonstrate the processors superior measurement of multiple data variables in very small devices. samsung also mentioned that the bio processor is already in mass production and will be in health and fitness devices starting this year. samsung is essentially inviting other wearable tech makers to see who how great its new bio processor is so that they can add it to their new devices soon. and its coming at the perfect time. over the next four years sales of wearable tech devices are expected to generate 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue. samsung has already learned that the consumer market isnt an easy place to sell devices so its trying to tap the processor market instead. the company has built a successful semiconductor business for itself even as its mobile device profits have begun to slip. if it can transition its success with processors into a lucrative wearable processor business the company wont need to rely on selling its own devices in order to benefit from wearables. its impossible to say at this point how well the bio processor will do or how many companies will use it. but i think that samsung is moving in the right direction here. the company has learned from its sinking mobile revenue that competing in the hardware space may not be the best way for it to make money. instead samsungs processors could hitch a ride with other hardware manufacturers to benefit from the burgeoning wearable revolution. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool

inc.  although the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle helped apple  see tremendous iphone unit growth part of the massive iphone revenue  growth story was due to a shift up in product mix. recall that the company released both the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus with storage configurations of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gb a nice change from the previous 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gb configurations in prior years. this new set of storage tiers made it almost a no brainer to go for the 00NUMBER00 gb iphones rather than the 00NUMBER00 gb models as that extra 00NUMBER00 bought the user a lot  of additional storage. per a new rumor from mydrivers via appleinsider   apple may be doing something similar with the iphone 00NUMBER00 of devices. a totally new storage tier    the report claims that apple will be adding a 00NUMBER00 gb storage tier to its iphone 00NUMBER00 plus offerings. this will reportedly come in addition  to the standard 00NUMBER00 models. the implication then is that the 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 will probably come priced 00NUMBER00 higher than the already quite pricey 00NUMBER00 gb model or about 00NUMBER00 a contract. although this doesnt seem like it could have a material impact on the companys iphone selling pricesbottom line i think that such a model could appeal to several classes of buyers and its existence could be good for a noticeable bump in blended average iphone selling prices. those that must  have the best    the iphone is a premium product and theres little doubt in my mind that there are a number of iphone customers who absolutely must  have the best iphone thats currently available for sale. 00NUMBER00 gb of storage is greater than 00NUMBER00 gb and significantly so such a model would easily appeal to those customers. additionally if this storage tier is exclusive to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then customers who would have potentially gone with a 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 may feel compelled to step up to a 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 plus instead netting apple an 00NUMBER00 in revenue. customers who want to shoot a bunch of 00NUMBER00 videos    with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus apple introduced the ability to shoot 00NUMBER00 videos at 00NUMBER00 frames per second. even at just 00NUMBER00 frames per second 00NUMBER00 videos by their very nature take up significantly more space than either 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 frames per second or 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 frames per second video. for customers who really enjoy shooting videos in 00NUMBER00 having he extra storage space is likely to prove useful. further if apple goes ahead and introduces 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 frames per second recording in this years iphones perhaps as a feature exclusive to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then such videos would require even more space than current 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 frames per second videos do. gamers too    one of the main draws of the ios ecosystem at least to this fool is that the platform is a very robust one for mobile gaming both due to fantastic developer support as well as the very capable processors that apple includes in its ios devices. unsurprisingly as mobile games become more visually rich game sizes themselves have increased significantly. its not uncommon to find games on ios that take up about one gigabyte of space. for power users who enjoy higher end mobile gaming and also take a fair amount of videosphotos more storage space would certainly be welcome. is this rumor legit    its hard to tell if this rumor is accurate or not. indeed as apple insider  s daniel dilger points out mydrivers track record isnt spotless. he also argues that keeping the 00NUMBER00 gb version exclusive to the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 plus would be an implicit signal from apple that the plus model is the superior device. apple has never presented the plus version as a superior device and instead markets the two iphone models as two options differentiated essentially only by size dilger writes. the latter is a good point but the iphone plus has been around for less than two years so its way too early to rule out a potential change in the companys strategy. at any rate i think this rumor makes sense and would not be at all surprised to see it proven true when apple launches its next generation flagships later this year. the next billion dollar

the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  for many investors a day in late january resembles the super bowl of all earnings reports. were talking apple  s first quarter earnings report of course. apple has been one of most closely watched companies on the street for years. investors everywhere tune in to see how the worlds most valuable publicly traded company performs each quarter particularly the holiday quarter the tech giants first fiscal quarter of every year which is the fourth calendar quarter is almost always the tech giants biggest quarter of the year. so mark your calendar. the california based technology company has just put a date on its earnings release jan. 00NUMBER00. heres an early preview of what investors will want to watch when the company reports first quarter results. expectations    leading up to apples first quarter earnings release analysts are on average expecting the company to report revenue and eps of 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 per share respectively. this compares to revenue and eps of 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 per share in the year ago quarter. if apple were to achieve these expectations for revenue and eps the companys revenue and eps would be up 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. revenue    one key focus when the company reports results will be revenue. the middle of apples guidance range for revenue suggests management expects 00NUMBER00 sales to increase only about 00NUMBER00. this would be a notable slowdown for the company considering its year over year revenue growth has been 00NUMBER00 or higher during the last four quarters. investors may have higher expectations for the tech giants revenue than analyst estimates suggest. apples revenue in the year ago quarter absolutely crushed estimates. analysts expected about 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during quarter and the company instead raked in around 00NUMBER00 billion. iphone sales    another metric investors will undoubtedly be watching closely when the company reports first quarter results is iphone sales. now accounting for about 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue the segments performance is more important to apples overall results than ever. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. during the year ago quarter apple sold a whopping 00NUMBER00 iphones far more than analysts were expecting. benefiting from pent up demand for apple phones with larger screens the iphone 00NUMBER00 sparked a wildly successful upgrade cycle for the company. the 00NUMBER00 million iphones shipped during the quarter represented 00NUMBER00 year over year growth in iphone unit sales. outdoing last years holiday quarter isnt going to be easy. for apple to be able to achieve the revenue it has guided for the company is probably going to need to sell at least as many iphones as it sold during the record year ago quarter. apples first quarter financial results will be released after market close on tuesday jan. 00NUMBER00. investors will have an opportunity to tune into the companys live conference call

2016-01-06 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.5597690163219788,0.2252059666313487,-0.0010066467403276,those who like to follow apple  component vendors probably know that one of the largest vendors of iphone displays is a company called japan display or more commonly jdi. in order to try to predict what sorts of features and functionality apples next generation devices will come with i try to look at what sorts of technologies that apples suppliers like jdi are working on and will have in production in time for the next iphone release. on dec. 00NUMBER00 jdi announced that it had commenced mass production of a new generation of in cell touch displays branded pixel eyes 00NUMBER00. i strongly believe that the same core technology of course with modificationsenhancements developed in a technical collaboration with apple will be used in apples upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 plus family of phones. to that end lets look at the key features that pixel 00NUMBER00 brings to the table and what it could mean for the idevice makers next generation iphone display and industrial design. a resolution increase on iphone 00NUMBER00 plus    when the iphone 00NUMBER00 first launched it wasnt too long before developers realized something interesting even though the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus featured a 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 pixel display images are being rendered at 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 internally and being downscaled to 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00. there are a number of hypotheses floating around as to why apple chose this particular scheme for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and 00NUMBER00 but the one that makes the most sense to me is that apple and its display suppliers couldnt produce 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 at a good enough cost structure to support mass production in 00NUMBER00. one feature that jdi touts for pixel eyes 00NUMBER00 displays is that it is much easier to achieve higher resolution compared to competing solutions and presumably to the prior generation pixel eyes displays. this may be just the technology that apple needs in order to actually show the full resolution that the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus render internally. thinner bezels incoming    one common complaint about the current iphone designs is that the bezels particularly compared to those on competing smartphones are just too large. apple could obviously make the phones smallermore portable by slimming those bezels down. according to a report from digitimes  apple was considering a move from in cell touch panels to on cell panels thanks to production bottlenecks that were said to prevent apple from adding new features as well as increasing resolutions. the report also claimed that a move away from in cell touch panels could allow apple to develop bezel free smartphones as in cell panels apparently currently struggle with touch sensitivity issues near the edges of the displays. interestingly another feature that jdi highlighted about its pixel eyes 00NUMBER00 displays is that the borders around these displays can go from around 00NUMBER00 millimeters to just 00NUMBER00. given that according to apples dan riccio every tenth of a millimeter in apples products is sacred this technology should do wonders to allowing apple to narrow those bezels. deeper blacks to appease iphone buyers until oleds    a story that has gained a lot of traction in the press is that apple is planning a shift away from liquid crystal displays toward organic light emitting diodes or oleds. this technology offers a number of advantages not the least of which is that black levels are virtually zero providing essentially infinite contrast ratios. however this technology isnt expected to arrive in the iphone until 00NUMBER00 around when the company is expected to launch iphone 00NUMBER00. until then though in order to effectively compete with other smartphone vendors that are using oled based displays apple needs to lower the black levels on the lcds it uses by as much as possible. japan display touts that its pixel eyes 00NUMBER00 displays implement new materials that ultimately allow for a deep black level among other things. if apple is able to offer displays with a contrast ratio of around 00NUMBER00 this would represent a nice jump from the current iphone displays and should do a good job tiding over apple customers until oled based iphones arrive. 00NUMBER00

disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple  enjoyed what could only be described as a phenomenal 00NUMBER00 fueled by the runaway successes of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. with these devices apple finally tapped into the significant pent up demand for larger screen iphones driving meaningful revenue and market share growth at the high end of the smartphone market and ultimately a solid boost in apples stock price. however after that excellent fiscal year apple seems to be getting fiscal 00NUMBER00 off to a relatively underwhelming start. the companys financial guidance calls for modest year over year revenue growth from the same period in the prior year but there have been several data points from apples supply chain to suggest that iphone sales in the companys fiscal second quarter will see a year over year decline. in my view it is due to this widespread belief that iphone sales will decline in the current fiscal year that  apple stock  has plunged from its 00NUMBER00 week high of about 00NUMBER00 per share to about 00NUMBER00 as of a recent check a more than 00NUMBER00 haircut. this has led some apple investors to blame apple ceo tim cook for the poor share price performance. however i dont think that this is entirely fair. what could tim cook have done differently    the thing that i just dont really  understand is just what some of the critics of apples management expecti have seen some arguments from frustrated investors saying that apples investor relations team should be more proactive in trying to counter some of the negative reports surrounding iphone demand trends. do these investors realize that theyre essentially asking apple to update its guidance andor issue guidance for the coming quarter while the quarter is still in progress maybe some investors would prefer if apple offered mid quarter updates like some major tech companies have historically done or perhaps they would like monthly sales data but frankly this an unreasonable request in this day and age. another complaint that ive seen from some investors is that tim cook doesnt do a good job painting a rosy picture of apples future to investors. look theres a reason that apple only guides one quarter at a time making predictions is really  hard and getting it right one quarter at a time is tough enough. imagine if apple issued full year guidance at the beginning of the year but was forced to update it several times during the year there arent a whole lot of businesses in tech that can even reliably guide out a year at a time so it would be borderline irresponsible for tim cook to come out and tell investors that everything is going to be great and wonderful over the next x years. of course there are some that would like it if apple were less secretive about its upcoming products but this secrecy is done precisely  to maximize shareholder value keeping things close to the vest helps apple in two major ways. the first is that it doesnt wind up subjecting its major product lines to the  osborne effect. apple wants the customer to feel that the products it has in the market are worth buying and it would be silly for the company to tell customers about what it has in the pipeline. next and perhaps more important apple doesnt want the competition to get wind of what its working on if thats at all possible. this means that whenever apple introduces a novel feature or specification the competition cant just catch up a month or two later. this helps apple stay competitive in the marketplace. tim cook is doing a fine job    i believe that tim cook is doing an excellent job running apple. although there are a few nitpicky things that i disagree with on the product side of things for example i think that using the same displays for two generations of iphones in a row hurts the companys competitiveness during s product cycles its hard to find fault with how cook and his team are running the company. apple stock is suffering from the companys iphone sales coming back down to earth after seeing a massive iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle plain and simple. now if apple fails to grow iphone sales during the coming iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle particularly since the year over year comparisons should be fairly easy to beat then this could signal a problem with how apple is running its business and ultimately an issue with tim cooks leadership. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the article should tim cook be blamed for the apple inc. stock plunge  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright © 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  source apple. apple  is going through a challenging phase. shares of the iphone maker are down by more than 00NUMBER00 from their highs of the last year due to fears about slowing growth in the middle term. the smartphone industry is maturing and it makes sense to expect a deceleration in iphone sales during the coming quarters. on the other hand slowing growth is already incorporated into apples current valuation and the business is still generating massive amounts of cash. this means that  apple stock  offers huge upside potential for investors in the long term. apples massive icash flows    apple owns tremendous brand power the forbes  brand ranking considers apple the most valuable brand in the word with an estimated value of 00NUMBER00 billion. brand differentiation and a reputation for quality allow the company to charge higher prices than the competition and this is reflected in sky high profit margins and huge cash flows for investors. the business brought in 00NUMBER00 billion in operating cash flow during the fiscal year ended in september of 00NUMBER00. this represents nearly 00NUMBER00 of revenue during the period. importantly operating cash flow jumped 00NUMBER00 versus the same period in the previous year. capital expenditures absorbed only 00NUMBER00 billion during the year leaving apple with 00NUMBER00 billion in free cash flow to reward investors with dividends and buybacks among other possibilities. management decided to allocate 00NUMBER00 billion to dividends and 00NUMBER00 billion to share buybacks last year so capital distributions accounted for 00NUMBER00 of free cash flow. share buybacks are creating considerable value for investors. a stock is simply a share in the ownership of a business and it represents a claim on the companys assets and earnings. all else being the same fewer shares outstanding means that each share is more valuable because it represents a larger percentage of the company. apple has reduced the number of shares outstanding by 00NUMBER00 in the last two years so the company is aggressively putting its capital to work for the benefit of its shareholders. aapl shares outstanding  data by ycharts. what this means for investors    short term uncertainty often can create buying opportunities for long term investors and this seems to be the case when it comes to apple stock right now. even if there is some kind of slowdown in growth in the middle term the market seems to be overreacting to this possibility. apple is trading at a price to cash flow ratio around 00NUMBER00. this is a significant discount versus the average company in the sp 00NUMBER00 index which trades at a price to cash flow ratio in the neighborhood of 00NUMBER00 according to data from morningstar. because apple is one of the most powerful and profitable corporations in the world this valuation looks excessively low. apple is distributing tons of cash to investors and this has big implications going forward. when considering both dividends and buybacks apple returned 00NUMBER00 billion in cash to investors during the last year. this represents a big payout yield dividends and buybacks over market capitalization value of nearly 00NUMBER00 for investors in apple stock at current prices. multiple statistical studies have confirmed that companies paying big shareholder yields tend to significantly outperform the market in the long term. among them  what works on wall street   is a great book by james oshaughnessy and it takes a look at how different investment strategies have performed over the years from a quantitative point of view. according to oshaughnessys calculations companies with high shareholder yield returned 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 while a broader basket of average stocks returned 00NUMBER00 during the same period. a difference of 00NUMBER00 annually can sound like small potatoes however make no mistake it can make all the difference in the world over the long term. to put the numbers in perspective this means that 00NUMBER00 invested in a broad basket of stocks would have turned into 00NUMBER00 over the period under analysis while the same amount of money invested in high shareholder yield stocks would have turned into a materially bigger 00NUMBER00 by the end of the period. in a nutshell apple could be facing slowing growth due to maturation in the smartphone industry. nevertheless the company produces tons of cash and the stock is priced at aggressively low levels in comparison to apples cash flows and distributions. for investors who can withstand the short term uncertainty apple looks like a buying opportunity over the long term. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the

generated 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue from apps and in app purchases which set back to back weekly records in terms of both traffic and purchases. new years day alone was the biggest sales day ever for the app store with customers spending more than 00NUMBER00 million. marketing chief phil schiller who just recently  took over leading the app store said that customers spent more than 00NUMBER00 billion in the app store throughout 00NUMBER00. cumulatively apple has now paid out almost 00NUMBER00 billion to developers since the app store was launched in 00NUMBER00 with a third of this revenue being generated within the past year. apple also pointed out that the app store is now a potent job creator. does it matter    apples robust content ecosystem of apps and other categories has long been a key to its success and customer loyalty. the majority of the innovation within the ios platform comes from third party developers and apple recognized this a long time ago. ios is also the most promising platform for developers because apple users have a higher propensity to actually spend money on content and apps compared to android users. the mac makers broader services segment which includes the app store has generated nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during the past four quarters. with todays announcement this figure will likely exceed the 00NUMBER00 billion threshold when apple reports fiscal first quarter earnings later this month. apple has often said that it operates its content stores around breakeven but theres a good chance that app store operating income is well into positive territory by now. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

version of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and only the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus recently hit mydriverscom. well known apple insider  columnist daniel dilger argues that apple has traditionally positioned the smaller and larger iphones as two equal devices rather than viewing the plus as the superior model. although dilger is correct that this has been apples strategy with the iphone 00NUMBER00 generations of iphones i think that apple would actually benefit  from changing this strategy up beginning with the iphone 00NUMBER00. heres why. unleashing the potential of the plus    even though apple sells relatively high priced premium devices the scope of improvements that the company can make each year is limited by the fact that the prices of its devices dont really change. with the iphone plus line devices with comparable storage to the standard iphones come priced at a whopping 00NUMBER00 higher. this higher selling price creates significant additional bill of materials headroom. additionally by virtue of its larger size the plus models can support more larger andor more powerful components. today the larger iphones include higher resolution displays optical image stabilization and larger batteries as the key points of differentiation relative to the smaller device. the larger phones also include some software tweaks to allow for additional perks while the devices are in landscape mode compared to the smaller phones. i believe that apple can and should be far more aggressive in making the larger iphones into their own phones rather than simply larger versions of the mainstream iphone. this in my view would ultimately make for a better more competitive large screen phone. what should apple do with the larger screen phones    i fully expect apple to continue to differentiate the larger screen iphones in the same ways that apple has done with the iphone 00NUMBER00 generations of phones battery size camera features and higher resolution displays but believe that the gap will increase with the iphone 00NUMBER00. for example there are already reports that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will feature three gigabytes of main memory while the standard iphone 00NUMBER00 will come with two. this is an example of apple using both increased cost structure headroom more memory costs more as well as the greater power headroom more memory consumes more power to deliver a fundamentally better  device. other areas where i would like to see apple enhance the larger iphone relative to the smaller iphone are in chip performance. the larger iphone has to drive a much higher resolution display than the smaller one so it would probably make sense for apple to include a fastermore powerful graphics processor on the chip that powers the larger iphone. i dont think apple will invest in creating two different chips for each of the iphones although i would be pleasantly surprised to see that but i could see apple running the cpu and graphics portions of the chips that it put into the larger phones at higher frequencies to deliver more performance. finally i dont think that apple was particularly well served with the iphone 00NUMBER00 generations of phones by making the larger phone look like a larger scaled up version of the smaller one. the company might be better off giving its designers more freedom to put together ideal industrial designs for each size even if it means making them look a little different from each other. by making sure the two phones looked like scaled versions of each other in the 00NUMBER00 plus generation apple seemed to make the bezels on the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus needlessly large compared to those found on competing 00NUMBER00 inch class devices. a common complaint in a number of reviews with trusted reviews  saying that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is still too big  and tech radar  calling it big and heavy. well know whats up apples sleeve in a few months most likely    once the next generation iphones go into production i dont think itll be too long before significant details of the next generation iphones start leaking to the web. itll be very interesting to see what design decisions apple ultimately made with the next generation iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus and to what extent the plus model is differentiated from the standard one. the next billion dollar

includes the fact that apple  actually underperformed  the broader market in 00NUMBER00. the mac maker fared worse than any of the three major indexes notably including the tech heavy nasdaq composite  as fellow tech peers put up better gains on average. aapl  data by ycharts. december was a particularly rough month for apple as that was when it gave up most of its gains and modest year to date outperformance   mostly as investors worried about the very real possibility that iphone unit sales may decline for the first time ever. still if apple continues to underperform for the next eight months ceo tim cook stands to lose quit a bit. doing whats right for shareholders    you might recall that way back in 00NUMBER00 cook voluntarily  chose to modify the massive grant of restricted stock units that he received in 00NUMBER00 upon becoming ceo. he received 00NUMBER00 rsu shares under the 00NUMBER00 award and these were initially only time based awards that would continue to vest as long as cook stayed with the company. the modification effectively converted a large portion of these shares to performance based awards where tranches would only vest if apple met certain criteria. this modification only has the potential to be negative for cook and there was no upside possibility to the change for his compensation. cook co. felt that it was the right thing to do to enhance corporate governance and cook asked the board that his 00NUMBER00 award and all future equity awards be subjected to performance criteria. heres a section from the relevant sec filing  from 00NUMBER00 the adopted modification mr. cook will forfeit a portion of the 00NUMBER00 ceo equity award which was previously entirely time based if the company does not achieve certain performance criteria. while the committee generally believes that a performance based award should have both a downside and an upside component at mr. cooks request the modification does not contain an upside opportunity for overachievement of these criteria. as a result of implementing a modification with only downside risk the committee has determined that a portion of the original grant should vest earlier than originally scheduled. this modification will not change the awards original value for accounting expense purposes. apple decided that the most relevant performance metric would be total shareholder return or tsr which includes reinvested dividends. but apples tsr must outperform comparable other companies for certain measurement periods for each related tranche to vest. if apple performs within the top third 00NUMBER00 of the tranche vests. if apple performs within the middle third 00NUMBER00 of the tranche vests. if apple performs within the bottom third 00NUMBER00 of the tranche vests. one tranche vested fully just a few months ago in august after apple scored within the top third its relative tsr 00NUMBER00 placed it in the 00NUMBER00 percentile of the 00NUMBER00 included comparable companies. but cook has another tranche coming up in august 00NUMBER00 and considering apples dip over the past month and the current pervasive investor pessimism around iphone order cuts which is probably just noise  anyway the executive could potentially have a lot at risk. apples lead is shrinking    apple has just filed its proxy statement  ahead of its upcoming annual shareholder meeting and the relevant measurement period for the august 00NUMBER00 tranche is aug. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 through aug. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. its not clear precisely which specific companies are included in the comparison but it is the majority of the sp 00NUMBER00. heres how apple has performed thus far in this measurement periodaapl  data by ycharts. during early 00NUMBER00 apple was handily beating the market but the latter half of the year was not kind and the outperformance gap for the period has closed quite a bit. apples cheap valuation usually doesnt do it too many favors since its an emotionally loaded stock thats popular with traders. even if fiscal first quarter earnings due out later this month are fundamentally solid in terms of earnings power and cash flow negative sentiment could still persist if iphone unit sales underwhelm investors. but depending on how peers do cook could miss out on some of those shares. the good news is that from a corporate governance perspective his interests are quite aligned with investors which was the whole purpose of the modification in the first place. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech

share largely thanks to multiple reports that the idevice maker is seeing weaker than expected demand for its latest iphone 00NUMBER00 plus smartphones. apples share price  performance over the last year. source ycharts. lately as i peruse comments from various apple shareholders discussing this news i see one pretty significant misconception that i would like to clear up here. apple would have warned if things were going badly    one common thought among some apple investors is that if things were truly going as badly for apples iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus as the various reports claim then the company should have come out and negatively pre announced that they were going to miss estimates. there is a significant problem in this thinking though the problems that these negative supply chain data points portend wont actually impact apples fiscal first quarter results theyll impact the guidance that apple will issue for its second fiscal quarter. since apple hasnt actually issued guidance for its fiscal second quarter theres nothing for the company to negatively pre announce. bad news and a silver lining for  apple stock    theres some bad news here and a potential silver lining for apple shareholders. the bad news is fairly obvious if these supply chain rumors are correct and frankly given that the rumorsreports from the supply chain seem to all point to weaker than hoped iphone builds i believe them apple is going to guide to a fairly underwhelming fiscal second quarter. indeed if iphone sales drop year over year its going to be very tough for apples other product categories to pick up the slack. furthermore if iphone sales drop year over year during the second fiscal quarter theres not a whole lot that apple can do aside from the introduction of the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00  to really stimulate sales during the third fiscal quarter. in a nutshell its looking like a rough year for apples once untouchable iphone segment. the potential silver lining here though is that the investment community by and large seems to be expecting iphone to go south during the fiscal second quarter and quite likely for the rest of the fiscal year. this means that pessimism around iphone is probably mostly built into the stock price. now thats not to say that iphone sales cant deteriorate further and come in even worse than even the most pessimistic expectations out there anything can happen. however as far as apple stock is concerned i think theres a reasonable chance that were close to if not at the bottom. an opportunity for iphone 00NUMBER00 optimists    at this point i believe that the initial performance of the iphone 00NUMBER00 i. e. first weekend sales will most likely be the next major catalyst for the stock price with the stock largely remaining range bound until then. if the initial first weekend numbers are strong then this could point to a much more robust iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle which could lead to appreciation in apple stock in anticipation of continued strength across the fiscal year though apple would still face the looming challenge of the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. if the initial iphone 00NUMBER00 numbers fail to impress then this could be a signal to investors that even with a dramatically improveddifferent product apple just cant juice iphone sales. although some might argue that apple has other product categories and that its not all  about iphone iphone has been and will likely continue to be apples main revenue and profit center for years to come. if iphone isnt growing or worse is in decline then apple will have a very hard time delivering revenue and profit growth in the years ahead which could ultimately lead to a further contraction in apples price to earnings ratio and ultimately stock price as investor confidence wavers. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool

analyzes facial expressions to gauge peoples emotions. there are three key performance indicators that emotient assesses attention engagement and sentiment and the small company offers customer insight services to companies to see how consumers respond to marketing product or service experiences. emotient emphasizes that emotions drive spending highlighting its value proposition when it comes to market research. does it matter    the mac maker regularly scoops up smaller companies that are under the radar and it has dramatically increased the rate at which it acquires companies. whenever the market or the media catches wind of it it confirms the acquisition and issues the typical response without providing any additional insight. while it seems that emotients technology could be useful in focus group settings apple famously never uses focus groups. but image recognition and facial detection are emerging technologies that many tech giants are investing heavily in particularly those companies that help users store manage and search personal photo libraries. at the same time many companies are researching deep learning and other ai technologies. just a few months ago apple also acquired vocaliq another ai start up that specializes in speech recognition technology. its not a stretch of the imagination that perhaps apple wants to bolster siris ai

iphone component orders by about 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 the site citing taiwan based supply chain makers. those same folks in the taiwan supply chain apparently said that apples iphone shipments during the first quarter of 00NUMBER00 roughly corresponds to apples fiscal second quarter will be down anywhere from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 year over year in a range of 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million units. theres no spinning this if these numbers are correct and i think there is a good chance that they are then current analyst estimates for the current fiscal year could be too high. heres why. building an estimate for fiscal 00NUMBER00 iphone shipments    ceo tim cook said on the companys most recent earnings call that he expects iphone sales in the first fiscal quarter 00NUMBER00 to grow from the levels seen at the same time last year. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones at that time so lets assume that the company was able to move around 00NUMBER00 million units in the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. then lets assume that digitimes  is correct that fiscal second quarter shipments will come in a range of 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million. using this information coupled with the seasonal pattern we saw in the prior fiscal year we could see iphone shipments by quarter that look like thisiphone shipments in millions of unitsfiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 est. 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 est. 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 est. 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 year 00NUMBER00 est. 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 author estimates. by way of reference apple sold about 00NUMBER00 million iphones during fiscal year 00NUMBER00. if my estimates are correct then apple is set to see a unit decline of anywhere from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 over year. if average selling prices are flat then the revenue declines should be in this range. for now im willing to assume flat average selling prices to fiscal 00NUMBER00. what does this mean for total apple revenue    during fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple generated approximately 00NUMBER00 in revenue from iphone. if units drop at the range mentioned above and assuming flat average selling prices then this could suggest iphone revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion. the decline in absolute dollar terms could be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 billion. no single apple product category is really going to be able to grow rapidly enough to offset that decline. in fact in order to really have a chance  of even just coming in flat in fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple will need to see robust growth in all of its product categories. the reality though is that expecting such growth is unrealistic. im not convinced that apple will be able to grow ipad in fiscal 00NUMBER00 in fact i think the best investors should reasonably hope for is a less steep decline than the ones seen over the last few years. mac may be able to grow by low to mid single digits but total mac revenue in fiscal 00NUMBER00 was just 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 growth in this segment would only bring in between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 billion in incremental revenue hardly enough. services and other products brought in about 00NUMBER00 billion in fiscal 00NUMBER00 roughly 00NUMBER00 billion for services and 00NUMBER00 for other with growth rates of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 year over year respectively. if we are to assume similar growth rates in fiscal 00NUMBER00 then that would be good for around 00NUMBER00 in incremental revenue. based on this analysis theres very little reason to be optimistic that in light of the decline that apple could be preparing to see in iphone apple will even be able to keep its total revenues flat  year over year let alone grow. conclusion analyst estimates are too high    current analyst consensus calls for apple to achieve fiscal year 00NUMBER00 revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion good for 00NUMBER00 growth from the prior fiscal year. i think that this estimate is too high and believe that when apple issues fiscal second quarter guidance analyst estimates will come down. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds

views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  idevice maker apple  just cant get a break these days. ahead of the companys jan. 00NUMBER00 earnings report there is significant fear within the investment community that apple will issue weak forward guidance driven by a substantial drop in iphone demand. although some analysts and investors dont seem to be convinced that the fairly numerous data points from the supply chain necessarily mean that iphone sales will do as badly as feared yet another data point just came in that points to bad news for apples iphone shipments. metal casing maker catcher technologies reduces 00NUMBER00 capex    according to the nikkei asian review the chairman of catcher technology a company that builds metal casings for apples iphone said that based on the forecast provided by our key customers we expect the first half of this year would be flat compared with last year. this reduction in outlook according to catchers chairman via nikkei asian review is due to order reductions from its customers that the company learned about in recent weeks. additionally the metal casing maker also disclosed that it would take down its capital expenditures in 00NUMBER00 to levels significantly lower than in 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 in response to weakening global demand according to nikkei asian review. why does this necessarily mean bad news for apple    one could conceivably argue that catchers weakness doesnt have to do with apple but instead with its other clients. however i dont think that explanation is all that plausible. first of all i doubt that catcher has any other customers as large as apple especially ones that could lead the company to take down its demand forecast for the first half of the year like this. now it could be argued that all  of catchers non apple customers suddenly decided to take down their order estimates but that again doesnt really make sense. indeed a jan. 00NUMBER00 report from digitimes claims that catchers revenue from non apple customers makes up around 00NUMBER00 of its total revenue and that that portion of its revenue base will continue to grow thanks to these clients new products for the first half of 00NUMBER00. it seems quite clear that catchers freshly downbeat outlook for the first half of 00NUMBER00 is driven by weakness at apple. theres little that apple can do at this point    with respect to iphone its hard to see what apple can do at this point. lowering prices in a bid to stimulate demandgain share would set a very bad precedent so this option doesnt really seem to be viable. apple could potentially give the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the hook and introduce the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus earlier than the fall which at least one technology news website fudzilla  claims is what apple plans to do though this fool is skeptical   but this would come with its own set of problems and challenges. for example id imagine those that bought the iphone 00NUMBER00 on launch day via apples recently announced iphone upgrade program would be quite miffed if they werent able to upgrade to either the 00NUMBER00 or the 00NUMBER00 plus at launch. apple and its shareholders are just going to have to tough it out through this product cycle. the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone thats rumored to be launching in the spring could serve to offset some of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus bad news though not all of it and maybe apples other businesses ipad apple watch and mac could grow enough to at least partially offset whats looking like an iphone decline in the current fiscal year. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at

source apple. the speculative rumor gains credibility    apple is prototyping a completely new set of bluetooth earphones reported mark gurman of 00NUMBER00. gurman who is well connected with reliable apple sources and has a very good track record with apple speculation says the new earphones could launch alongside the iphone 00NUMBER00 this fall. further gurman says sources confirm that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will not include a standard headphone jack and will instead require headphones to connect via the lightning connector or wirelessly over bluetooth. speculation that apple would ditch the headphone jack on the iphone 00NUMBER00 an article on japanese website mac otakara. the website cited a reliable source but the claim was glossed over because otakaras track record with rumors is mixed. but gurmans voice adds credibility to speculation about apples plans to ditch the headphone jack. the headphones which gurman says will sport the beats brand will be similar to the motorola hint and bragis new dash earphones which were both demonstrated at ces this week. gurman offers more details its expected that the in development accessory will include a noise cancelling microphone system enabling phone calls and communication with siri even without apples prior in line microphone and remote. in order to fit inside of the users ear apple will likely develop different sized ear sleeves for the hardware similar to the approach used by motorola and bragi. the headphones will be sold separately from the iphone 00NUMBER00 a premium alternative to a new version of apples earpods gurman predicts. apple design    as crazy as it may seem for apple to ditch the headphone jack its definitely a move that fits the companys persistent pursuit of sleeker thinner and simpler designs. in 00NUMBER00 apple controversially ditched the floppy disk drive when it launched the imac 00NUMBER00. just three years ago the company began a transition away from its 00NUMBER00 pin connector in favor of the lightning connector. then of course theres apples gradual shift away from disc drives  across all of its computers. and more recently apple even combined usb and power ports with its usb c port on its new macbook. macbook. image source apple. further ditching the headphone jack on the iphone 00NUMBER00 would be in line with the companys practice of launching its new flagship phone with an overhauled exterior design every other year. for instance the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 all had different form factors than their predecessors while the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 sustained their predecessors form factors. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is particularly important for apple. after guiding for low single digit revenue growth for its holiday quarter

for 00NUMBER00 and most fingers are pointed to troubling macro economic data out of china along with the middle kingdoms brutal market sell off. the shanghai composite index  is already down 00NUMBER00 year to date and its only been a week. you probably also saw those headlines about the day that the chinese market was only open for less than 00NUMBER00 minutes before circuit breakers which have since been suspended were triggered ending the day down 00NUMBER00. meanwhile pessimism surrounding apple  continues to build as well in part because china is such an important market for the mac maker. but there are two important reasons why all of the china related storylines wont affect apple as much as you might think. chinas stock market participation is very low    its true that chinas stock market is largely dominated by retail investors instead of institutional investors a stark contrast to the u. s. with an estimated 00NUMBER00 of all capital accounts owned by retail investors. chinese investors also tend to be short term traders instead of long term investors which contributed to heightened volatility. but its also true that overall stock market participation is fairly low in china so the gyrations arent directly affecting the average consumer. for example the southwestern university of finance and economics in chengdu conducts a regular china household finance survey led by professor gan li. according to the survey just 00NUMBER00 of households in china owned stock during the first quarter of 00NUMBER00. so while the volatility of the chinese stock market makes for some panicky headlines the average chinese consumers discretionary spending and income is just fine. they can still go out and buy that iphone. chinas slowing gdp growth is not affecting the mainstream consumer    the other recurring theme is chinas slowing macroeconomy as evidenced by decelerating gdp growth rates. but again these gdp figures arent directly translating into reduced income or spending on the consumer level. quite the contrary in fact. much of chinas gdp growth over the past decade has been driven by investing and exports but chinas economy is now transitioning toward consumer consumption which will only benefit  consumer oriented companies like apple. consider per household annual consumption by category from 00NUMBER00 along with forecasts through 00NUMBER00 where discretionary categories are growing the fastestsource mckinsey. or consider the fact that apples china business has grown incredibly  against a backdrop of slowing gdpsource sec filings and the world bank. china gdp growth measured in constant local currency. calendar years shown. the rising middle class in china wont be stopped and thats good news for apple. the next

apple  have lost more than a quarter of their value in the last six months as investors have worried about a possible iphone sales slump this year. these worries have intensified in the past few weeks as a slew of apples suppliers have provided disappointing sales outlooks. is apple dramatically cutting iphone production image source the motley fool. in the past week the biggest damage came from a report in japans nikkei asian review  that apple had told suppliers to plan on a 00NUMBER00 year over year output cut  for its flagship iphones during the first quarter of 00NUMBER00. investors should take this report with a grain of salt. three years ago in the midst of similar reports about iphone order cuts apple ceo tim cook warned analysts that supply chain data was not a reliable proxy for apples sales. for the quarter in question iphone sales ultimately rose 00NUMBER00 over year. but even if this new nikkei  report is factual its not necessarily as negative for apple as investors seem to think. the impact of this production cut  assuming its real depends on the answers to three key questions. when were production cuts implemented    the first big question has to do with the timing of any production cuts. nikkei  claims that apple initially intended for combined production of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus this quarter to be in line with its iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus production in the year ago period. if apple only told its suppliers about a 00NUMBER00 output cut in the last few weeks it probably still has enough component inventory to maintain production at a higher rate during january. and january is the busiest month of the quarter for iphone production under any circumstances due to the chinese new year holiday a big demand driver in china falling in february. unless apple cut its iphone production at the beginning of january in which case it probably would have needed to slash component orders in november the actual year over year decline in production of flagship iphones this quarter would be less than 00NUMBER00. are older iphones picking up the slack    second the nikkei  report stated that the production cuts only affected the 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. meanwhile older models like the 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus have continued to sell. thats not especially surprising. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus arent selling well because consumers dont see them as a big upgrade over their predecessors it makes sense that the discounted iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models seem appealing by comparison. strong sales of older models could offset sales declines for the flagship iphones. image source apple. the real question is just how well these older models have continued to sell. combined sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 in this fiscal year should easily exceed sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 a year ago. sales increases for older models could go a long way toward offsetting a year over year sales slowdown for apples flagship phones. is this a short term inventory correction  a third question is how long a potential iphone production cut would last. even a double digit sales decline for a single quarter wouldnt be that bad if iphone sales were flat or rising during the rest of the year. on the other hand several quarters in a row of double digit iphone sales declines would significantly cut into apples earnings. from this perspective too the outlook isnt as dire as the headlines suggest. apples suppliers were reportedly told that the planned production cut for the first quarter was designed to reverse some unwanted channel inventory growth. by april production will return to normal if the story is accurate. if the rumors that apple will begin selling a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone  in april are true that would further support sales in the second half of the 00NUMBER00 fiscal year which runs through september. no reason for panic    the recent tumult has driven apple shares back into double digit territory where they trade for less than 00NUMBER00 times forward earnings particularly when you adjust for apples still massive cash hoard. however investors are wrong to panic. this weeks nikkei  report is a great example of a story that appears extremely troubling on the surface but actually conveys mixed news  some good and some bad. analysts who are now projecting steep iphone sales declines for the rest of the 00NUMBER00 fiscal year are probably overreacting. finally its worth remembering the old adage the darkest hour is just before the dawn. no matter what happens with iphone sales in the next two or three quarters apple will probably be pumping out record quantities of the iphone 00NUMBER00 this fall. by then investors will have completely forgotten the worries that haunt them today. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show

views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  source apple. the initial rumor mill chatter about weak iphone sales has blown up into actual warning signs and some  apple  investors are running for the hills. the stock has surrendered 00NUMBER00 of its value this young year and thats coming off an atypical 00NUMBER00 that wound up being its first down year since 00NUMBER00. the culprit is the growing concern that iphone production is slowing on softening consumer demand. early reports claimed that iphone assembler foxconn was cutting hours for next months lunar new year holiday. foxconn denied those claims but it still warned that revenue for december was 00NUMBER00 below the year earlier. that in and of itself doesnt seal apples fate. a rough december at foxconn and rumblings of scaling back production next month could mean a lot of different things that dont place apple in dire straits. foxconn does have other customers. apple could be slowing iphone 00NUMBER00 orders in anticipation of rolling out an updated iphone 00NUMBER00 model sooner than previous annual updates. nothing is certain until its announced but between foxconn and some apple suppliers that are offering up bleak near term outlooks its only natural to connect the dots. wall street pros who are paid to connect those dots before retail investors arent taking any chances. were seeing some pretty rough rhetoric about the company that until very recently was the market darling of consumer electronics. managements confidence now looks highly likely to be misplaced which suggests that it was either ignorant of the challenges it faced or deliberately overstating underlying trends pacific crest wrote concluding that the merry days of assuming that apple perpetually puts out conservative guidance are toast. we now believe apple is experiencing weaker than expected iphone demand ubs opined. news of worker reductions at key ems and component vendors cant be ignored. our sense is that iphones are likely sitting at higher than optimal inventory across multiple geographies and as a result aapl has implemented further production curtailment across the supply chain rbc wrote but at least it limited its concern to the current quarter. it sees this as a temporary hiccup that should be resolved by the time we get to apples fiscal third quarter. some analysts feel hoodwinked and others cant believe how quickly the device that drives the lions share of apples revenue and earnings has turned. ubs was leaning on recent surveys showing that android switchers to ios are on the rise implying that the weakness is coming mostly from existing iphone owners. thats pretty significant and it may lead one to wonder if u. s. wireless providers move away from subsidized smartphones isnt at the root of this recent weakness. until recently wireless carriers were willing to eat hundreds of dollars upfront to get you into a two year service contract. the shift these days is to get buyers to finance new phone purchases at the full retail price in exchange for cheaper connectivity charges. it may seem like a small distinction but it does have a lingering psychological impact on existing owners pondering an upgrade. in the old days it felt as if you were ripping yourself off if you didnt upgrade after two years since you were still paying the inflated monthly service price. now its almost as if its a relief after the monthly financing installments are complete giving you a price break until one has to upgrade. the onus is now on apple to prove that this is not the case. investors and analysts have had their confidence rattled. the stock has fallen in six of the past seven months and its digging itself into a big hole so far in january. however with apples history of innovation and current low valuation even in light of cascading profit targets. its hard to bet against the class act of cupertino for the long haul. the future is as bright as the present is not. the next billion dollar isecret  the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the

motley fool has a disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  at this point it is well known that apple  is facing significant challenges with this iphone cycle. multiple negative data points from many major apple suppliers two suppliers even went so far as to negatively pre announce   suggest that apple has cut perhaps dramatically its iphone build plans for the next several quarters. interestingly analysts with boutique research firm bluefin via barrons have a fairly novel explanation of what might actually be going on with respect to iphone. this hypothesis if true could potentially point to the beginning of a negative long term trend for apple. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus not doing that well but iphone 00NUMBER00 holding up    the analysts claim that the 00NUMBER00 reduction with respect to iphone builds that has been circulating in the press is specific to the 00NUMBER00 models and doesnt represent the decline in total iphone builds. indeed the analysts say that production of the older 00NUMBER00 plus models as well as the iphone 00NUMBER00 has surprisingly enough increased  over the last month. ultimately the bluefin analysts say that apple misfired with respect to product mix. a big year over year decline as mix shifts down    if bluefins estimates are correct then apple will ship 00NUMBER00 million iphone units in the march quarter this year down about 00NUMBER00 million units or around 00NUMBER00 year over year. this reduction the analysts say is due to the fact that apple is trying to draw down channel inventories. it would seem to me then that apple overshipped  during the first calendar quarter relative to demand leading to a swelling of channel inventory which is probably why the company didnt wind up issuing a revenue warning for its first calendar quarter. however the more alarming part of this note is that demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which are older and sell for less  seems to be holding up fairly well. worse mix could mean lower average selling prices    in a previous analysis contemplating the potential year over year iphone related revenue decline apple may face in fiscal 00NUMBER00 i estimated that revenue will decline about in line with unit shipments as average selling prices could be flat. however it would seem now that a reasonable assumption would be to expect iphone average selling prices to potentially contract  during apples fiscal year 00NUMBER00. average selling price declines atop of what looks to be a unit decline of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 year over year  might mean iphone revenue declines solidly in the double digits this year. why is iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand so weak as iphone 00NUMBER00 demand holds    in the last two iphone cycles apple has seen much stronger demand for its latest premium flagships than for its previous generationlower end models. however this years lower end models are quite unique compared to those seen in prior cycles. during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle apple stopped production of the older generation iphone 00NUMBER00 and in its place sold the plastic shelled iphone 00NUMBER00. then during the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle the cheaper iphones were the 00NUMBER00 inch 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. however during this cycle things are much different. the value options are now the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. they dont have the featuresperformance that the newer iphone 00NUMBER00 plus have but they look very similar are actually thinner and lighter and are quite a bit cheaper for comparable storage options. frankly for the first time in several generations apples cheaper phones are still quite excellent choices especially for those who want to save money. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus issues are clear    in hindsight its not hard to see why iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand isnt proving to be as robust as hoped. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus isnt compelling enough for many iphone 00NUMBER00 plus buyers to upgrade while the 00NUMBER00 plus were compelling options for buyers of even the 00NUMBER00 in the year prior. on top of that for buyers with older iphones say 00NUMBER00 and older the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at cheaper price points are perfectly good. looking ahead to iphone 00NUMBER00 will be interesting to see what apple keeps around as its cheaper options once the iphone 00NUMBER00 launches. if it keeps the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at their current price points and replaces 00NUMBER00 plus with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then apple risks having less competitive products at those price points where its competition is innovating quite fiercely. if it pushes the 00NUMBER00 plus down then apple faces the same risk of seeing again what appears to be happening this year. what will work in apples favor though is that the iphone 00NUMBER00 should bring all new industrial designs as well as internal upgrades. another factor is that if we assume people upgrade their phones every two years or so the people who bought the 00NUMBER00 plus could be preparing to upgrade again. those folks may choose the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus if its cheaper but id imagine that those customers would be more interested in the 00NUMBER00. well just have to see how it all plays out. unfortunately for apple shareholders i dont think things have the potential to get very interesting until the iphone 00NUMBER00 launches which is still a good eight to nine months away. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies

this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the january 00NUMBER00 expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the january 00NUMBER00 for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost   for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to climb 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to happen meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do

the south korean based conglomerate said that it would allow its latest smartwatch the gear 00NUMBER00 to work with apple  s ios. this means that the companys high end smartwatch now has the ability to be paired with an iphone where before it could only work with android smartphones. at first blush that doesnt sound like a big deal. after all plenty of smartwatches that arent built by apple already work with ios. but this is the first time samsungs allowed its smartwatches to do so and it shows just how much the company is in need of apples mobile dominance. after more than two yeas in the smartwatch space samsungs failed to garner much interest from wearable tech consumers while the apple watch has quickly become the smartwatch of choice. samsung thinks pairing its gear 00NUMBER00 watch with ios may increase consumer demand for its wearable tech. its a move that comes not only as samsung is losing the wearable tech battle but also as its mobile influencing is slipping. samsungs mobile misses    sales of the companys high end devices have been slipping putting pressure on samsungs revenues. in 00NUMBER00 the company earned about 00NUMBER00 of its total revenue from its mobile division but that number now stands around 00NUMBER00. while samsung is still the leader by worldwide shipment volumes the company has felt the pressure of apples rising iphone sales in markets like the u. s and china. with the iphones dominating high end smartphones sales samsung has realized that its going to need more than just its own devices to spur interest in its wearables. worrying wearable market share    the latest data from idc shows that apple shipped 00NUMBER00 million smartwatches in 00NUMBER00 while samsung trailed far behind with just 00NUMBER00 million. and things arent expected to get much better for samsung. idc notes that by 00NUMBER00 apples watchos will take 00NUMBER00 of smartwatch market share while android wear will take 00NUMBER00 and samsungs own tizen operating system which powers the gear 00NUMBER00 smartwatch will only take 00NUMBER00. by tying its latest smartwatch to apples mobile os the company may be able to change its position in the smartwatch space. but it also may have the unintended consequence of giving apple even more influence in the market. looking ahead    no one is expecting tizen powered samsung smartwatches to drive sales of apples iphones but samsungs move sends a message particularly to its tizen developers that apples mobile platform is the one that will drive wearable tech growth. to boost its position in wearables i think samsung needs to turn its attention back to android wear for its high end smartwatches and away form tizen. tizen is samsungs attempt to assert more control over its devices and distance itself from its need for google but so far that hasnt worked out for samsung and im skeptical that it ever will. tizen doesnt have the extensive app network that android wear and ios have and the os isnt as well known to consumers as apples and googles platforms are. and considering that android wear smartwatches are already compatible with ios samsung wouldnt be sacrificing its new strategy of allowing its wearables to pair with iphones. theres still plenty of time for samsung to reposition itself in the wearables market as it may be doing with wearable tech processors   but if it cant get its strategy right soon samsung will continue losing the wearable tech battle and its mobile position will keep declining. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution

needs apple to compete  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  one of the features of apple  s iphones that people seem to really care about is the camera. for many if not most people their smartphone cameras are their onlyprimary cameras so it makes sense that its a feature that gets a lot of attention from both consumers and apple alike. back in april it was widely reported that apple had purchased a start up called linx for 00NUMBER00 million. linx worked on the development of multi aperture cameras essentially using multiple smaller sensors rather than one larger sensor to boost image quality. theres little doubt in my mind that apple plans to bring this technology to a future iphone and i think that well see it sooner rather than later. the question though is whether well see it on the iphone 00NUMBER00 or if well have to wait for the follow on device presumably known as the iphone 00NUMBER00 to see it. an iphone 00NUMBER00 debut is more likely heres why    with the difficulties that apple seems to be facing in driving demand for its latest iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones as evidenced by reports of iphone 00NUMBER00 plus component order cuts apple will certainly be under substantial pressure to bring increasingly interesting and innovative technologies to the marketplace. at the same time though novel technologies can be quite difficult to implement particularly in a way thats cost effective. thats why advancements in the technology that rolls out to end users tends to be fairly gradual. i believe that apple will be able to wring out one more significant generational improvement in its camera with a traditional single sensor implementation. indeed there are still several low hanging fruit that apple can exploit to deliver significant image quality enhancements without needing to go to a multi sensor implementation. for example apple could move to a wider camera aperture the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus feature an 00NUMBER00 aperture while competing smartphones have already moved on to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 even 00NUMBER00 to enable better low light photos. business insider also reported last year that apple is looking to move from a five element lens to a six element lens which should further boost image quality particularly in low light conditions. i could also see apple utilizing a newly designed sensor to deliver even better image quality. a radical camera improvement coupled with an oled display could make for a killer iphone 00NUMBER00 of the problems that i think is plaguing the iphone 00NUMBER00 is the fact that aside from 00NUMBER00 touch it had no killer feature compared to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. i believe that theres a solid chance that iphone 00NUMBER00 brings enough changesimprovements over the iphone 00NUMBER00 generation of phones to ignite a solid upgrade cycle. however apple will once again face a challenge with the iphone 00NUMBER00 to try to bring something truly compelling and unique to the table especially if it carries over the same industrial design that it used with the 00NUMBER00. this new camera technology coupled with a newer much more advanced image signal processor baked into the 00NUMBER00 chip could be a big part of that value proposition. additionally cowen and co. analyst timothy arcuri recently said via barrons that apple is working on a proprietary oled display technology that it could ask samsung   to build for it for fall 00NUMBER00. if apple moves to a substantially better camera introduces an oled based display and all of the other typical internal upgrade goodies that come with s cycle upgrades the company could be in a strong position to grow during the 00NUMBER00 cycle off of what could be a very nice iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00

in the press that apple  was preparing an updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone to replace the 00NUMBER00. early reports suggested that this phone would share many key internal components with the flagship iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones such as the 00NUMBER00 processor and the inclusion of two gigabytes of new 00NUMBER00 memory. however a fresh report from chinese website cnbeta via macrumors claims that the updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone reportedly to be called the iphone 00NUMBER00 might have more in common with 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 than with the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. lets take a closer look. 00NUMBER00 processor 00NUMBER00 gigabyte of memory    the report claims that the new device will come with apples 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte of ram identical to what the 00NUMBER00 plus came packed with. those phones are hardly slouches  theyre still premium phones and still deliver very good performance across the board but using older lower performance components signals to customers that these newer 00NUMBER00 inch iphones arent flagships. although it would have been nice to see apple include the higher performance 00NUMBER00 processor and endow the new 00NUMBER00 inch device with more memory there are some fairly good reasons for the company to go with the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte of ram. first of all the 00NUMBER00 is likely materially cheaper to build than the 00NUMBER00 as the former is both smaller and built on a less costly manufacturing process. secondly the 00NUMBER00 uses 00NUMBER00 is older and thus cheaper to procure than the 00NUMBER00 that pairs with the 00NUMBER00. finally id imagine that apple needs as many ways to differentiate its latest flagships relative to older andor cheaper models and saddling the iphone 00NUMBER00 with an 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte of memory is one way to do that. apple pay support    the updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphones are said to include support for its payments service known as apple pay. given that apple is working to establish an ecosystem around apple pay it would make sense for the company to want to make sure that all of the iphones that it sells support the feature. the iphone 00NUMBER00 already included apples touch id fingerprint reader so the only real cost adder relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00 to support this feature would be an nfc chip and related components. these shouldnt be all that expensive. same camera new color option 00NUMBER00 gb models and volte    the report claims that the new iphone will feature the same camera specifications as the iphone 00NUMBER00. this is a bit unfortunate as the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus brought some very compelling camera features that probably would have worked nicely on this new 00NUMBER00 inch device and served as additional selling points. on the bright side apple will reportedly be offering the updated iphone 00NUMBER00 in a rose gold finish. although this might seem like almost a triviality id imagine that quite a few customers found the rose gold finish on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus appealing this fool did and would like to see it on a smaller iphone. next the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphones are said to come in 00NUMBER00 gb 00NUMBER00 gb storage configurations. considering that the iphone 00NUMBER00 is currently only sold in either 00NUMBER00 gb or 00NUMBER00 gb storage configurations this new storage tier structure should be more effective in encouraging 00NUMBER00 inch iphone buyers to buy up the product stack. finally the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphones are said to support voice over lte calling a feature that apple first introduced in its iphone 00NUMBER00 plus smartphones. nice refresh but not a game changer    it seems that apple is doing an interesting albeit conservative update to its 00NUMBER00 inch iphones. i dont think that this update will be enough to spark a significant upgraderefresh cycle but it should help to keep the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone offerings reasonably fresh over the next year or so. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are three stocks that are poised to explode

watching the report to review their expectations for the quarter. while the results will be important for a number of reasons one area in particular will likely get extra attention when the company reports apples guidance for its next quarter or 00NUMBER00. the tech giants guidance will give investors a better idea as to whether or not the company can hold up against its tough comparisons in the year ago quarter. will iphone sales decline   rewind to apples second fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. revenue 00NUMBER00 compared to the second quarter in 00NUMBER00 representing enormous growth for the worlds most valuable company. driving the growth was the companys latest iphone lineup which included the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. apples foray into smartphones with larger displays was proving to be a major catalyst for the company during the year. iphone unit sales were up 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter and iphone revenue was up 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. now here we are heading into apples first quarter results where investors will get their first glimpse at managements expectations for the second quarter. can apple live up to the huge success it had in the year ago quarterthe big question about apples guidance therefore is whether or not the company will be able to avoid guiding for a year over year decline in sales during 00NUMBER00. and more specifically guidance will provide insight into apples expectations for its iphone business. with apples iphones representing about 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue 00NUMBER00 iphone sales will need to rival sales in the year ago quarter for the company to be able to avoid reporting a year over year decline in revenue growth for the quarter. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. if the tech giant guides for similar revenue as it reported in the year ago quarter then investors will know the companys latest iphone cycle is performing well in the marketplace. if on the other hand the company guides for a year over year decline in revenue investors will know apple is having trouble living up to its big results last year. putting apples guidance into perspective   even if apple guides for a year over year decline in 00NUMBER00 investors should rest easy. for a company that 00NUMBER00 of its revenue from a single product category this sort of volatility in revenue growth is bound to occur especially since apple reported 00NUMBER00 year over year revenue growth in its year ago quarter. but the greatest reason apple investors shouldnt sweat volatility in revenue is because of the companys wildly conservative valuation. currently trading at less than 00NUMBER00 times earnings business growth over the long haul would be like icing the cake net income growth isnt priced into the stock at these levels. share repurchases alone could easily drive around 00NUMBER00 annualized eps growth even if the companys net income peaked where it is now. so ill be watching guidance when apple reports earnings this month. but as an investor with a time horizon well beyond five years im going to need far more than a single quarters data to conclude that the tech giant along with its massive user base of extremely loyal customers is a business in decline. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall

which is a legitimate issue considering the dominance of white males throughout the tech industry. many tech giants including apple have now started to release regular diversity reports that lay out statistics regarding their workforces. with that in mind you might think that apple would be supportive of a shareholder proposal to increase  diversity at the companys highest levels. youd be wrong and heres why its appropriate for apples board to be pushing back. aye or nay    in the proxy statement   an individual shareholder has proposed that apple implement an accelerated recruitment policy that requires the company to increase the diversity of senior management and the board of directors. the shareholder does not believe that minorities are adequately represented. the shareholder believes this is contrary to apples stated diversity policies. apples board is recommending that shareholders vote against  the proposal. four more years four more years    the proposal in question is flawed because it could be analogous to affirmative action which has been controversial for decades due to the potential for reverse discrimination. even though apple senior management and board of directors does include a disproportionate number of white males that shouldnt undermine the companys overall philosophy toward diversity. keep in mind that these are quite qualified  white males that have earned their stripes and worked their way to the top. as an investor i wouldnt want anyone other than tim cook running the company right now and he also happens to be one of the most prominent ceos that is openly gay. apple has added a few women to its executive ranks recently including angela ahrendts svp of retail lisa jackson vp of environmental policy and denise young smith vp of hr. african american james bell former longtime boeing  cfo joined the board just a few months ago while andrea jung former avon ceo has long sat on the board. apple notes that it actively seeks out qualified women and individuals from minority groups when looking for board nominees. since the shareholder proposal focuses only on senior management and the board were talking about two relatively small groups of people. thats part of the problem. think bigger picture    apple is very committed to diversity but on a much larger scale than just its management team or board of directors. its an important aspect of apples culture so much so that tim cook sent out a companywide email just a few months ago when a group of black teenage students were racially discriminated against at an apple store in australia. cook called the incident unacceptable and said it does not represent apples values. at the same time cook has acknowledged that while apple has made progress with diversity it still has a lot more work to be done. but implementing a recruitment policy for management and the board that puts gender or race above qualifications is misguided particularly as apple has already made it clear that diversity is a core value for the mac maker. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street

of reason to be optimistic heading in 00NUMBER00. unfortunately the apple news thus far this year has been anything but upbeat. its stock has fallen an additional 00NUMBER00 the early days of 00NUMBER00 as a number of negative stories have further obscured the companys outlook. however with an updated iphone due out later this year past data suggests that apple is in fact a screaming buy 00NUMBER00. crucially though the ideal time to buy might not be today for two important reasons. the case for waiting    for those who havent been closely following the apple story the recent downward pressure on its shares largely relates to concerns about demand for its iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. according to a number of credible media reports  apple has reduced orders from component suppliers for its all important smartphone in recent weeks. in one particularly troubling anecdote chinese electronics supplier foxconn which assembles most of apples iphones reportedly received a 00NUMBER00 million subsidy from the chinese government to help the firm minimize firings related to apples production slowdown. this has led to understandable concerns that apples jan. 00NUMBER00 earnings report could come in lighter than analysts expected an event that could generate further negative sentiment about its shares. and though we at the fool dont necessarily believe in timing the market waiting to see what apples actual results were last quarter seems like prudent risk management in this case. thats not to say however that the time to buy apple isnt around the corner. buy apple in early march   though near term risk factors understandably loom large apples historical trading record supports the case for owning its shares in the run up to a new iphone launch. with most rumor mongers expecting a september 00NUMBER00 release for the 00NUMBER00 that would favor buying the shares in march. apple is a product driven company and as such investors anticipation for its upcoming products influences its stock price performance to some extent. and with the iphone sitting at the epicenter of apples product universe the excitement generated among investors each time the company updates the devices form factor has typically led to a marked outperformance in the stock. its important to recognize this caveat correlation isnt necessarily causation here so investors cant interpret these previous performances as gospel. however theres also a logical basis to help explain why apple would outperform in the run up to each new iphone. source ychartstwo years is a long time in the tech world and apple has gone to great lengths to expand its global distribution network a fact that allows more consumers to buy its new iphone with each form factor overhaul that occurs. the prospect of a new form factor also plays into many consumers buy or wait decisions in the quarters prior to a new iphone debut. unless theyve broken their smartphone most consumers find it relatively easy to delay purchasing a new model for a few months and the prospect of apple releasing an exciting new form factor likely stacks the sales deck in favor an impressive initial sales burst with each major iphone design overhaul. there is of course an equally important disclaimer other company specific and market wide issues will play roles in how  apple stock  trades. if these chinese economy implodes the coming months might not be the most enjoyable time to own equities as a general proposition. specifically apple stocks repeating its past behavior this time around should be thought of as a likelihood not a certainty. but while apple investors might want to wait to see whether its first quarter numbers disappoint they also would do well to understand that based on history the run up to the iphone 00NUMBER00 release generally bodes well for apple stock. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall

those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. theres been a lot of talk that apple  might host a product event in march. the two products most likely to get some attention are an apple watch 00NUMBER00 and a possible 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 although there are a few other possibilities  of what the mac maker might have in store. well the latest rumor is that a full fledged apple watch 00NUMBER00 refresh might take a little bit longer. worth the wait   techcrunch  is reporting that there are recent indications that the next version of apple watch may only include very  minor updates. supply chain rumblings also suggest that there hasnt been a lot of activity when it comes to component orders and apple should be increasing component orders if its preparing to ramp up for a major product refresh in just a matter of months. in fairness the component order ramp for the current apple watch was fairly modest because of the relatively lower volume levels compared with the iphone or ipad. theres a possibility that apple might only add a facetime camera with a larger hardware update to come at a later time. hare are a few reasons its perfectly fine if the apple watch 00NUMBER00 timing is pushed out a bit. upgrade priority    first off because of the nascent nature of the smartwatch market no one has any idea of what the typical upgrade cycle will look like. the ipad was released nearly six years ago and apple is still  trying to figure out what the average upgrade cycle is. the uncertainty around ipad upgrades is one reason ipad unit sales have been trending lower for the past couple of years combined with the fact that tablets have lower upgrade priority than smartphones and laptops. i think its safe to say that smartwatches will categorically have even lower upgrade priority  than tablets which suggests that there should be no rush to release an apple watch 00NUMBER00 until its ready. theres no compelling reason apple would feel obligated to adopt a one year product cycle particularly as the company has demonstrated that it doesnt need to do so with the ipad either. apple didnt upgrade the ipad air 00NUMBER00 at all in 00NUMBER00 for instance. more time to work on features    the current apple watchs reception has been mixed as well and while there are some obvious areas where apple could focus on such as battery life some of these may take more development time. you could also argue that some of the apple watchs weaknesses relate to third party developers. plenty of apps suffer from poor performance because they havent been updated to native apps and theres only so much apple can do to push them on this front. if apple needs more time to make the use case more compelling it should take it. cycle timing    were now coming out of a busy holiday shopping season and third party estimates suggest that apple watch was quite a popular gift over the holidays. its never a good feeling to get a brand new gadget only to see it updated just months later and now all of a sudden you have a previous generation model. this could even be why apple transitioned away from spring ipad updates years ago. this is particularly potent considering how unique apple watch pricing is. since apple has worked very hard to position apple watch as a fashion item and priced it accordingly it would make sense to give the product a longer cycle since all of the users who paid up for higher end models solely for aesthetic value  would get more mileage out of that premium. balancing fashion where high value items retain value very well and technology where high value items depreciate very quickly is a hard thing to do. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event

income in fiscal 00NUMBER00 which ended in september putting the pe ratio at just about 00NUMBER00. backing out the 00NUMBER00 billion of net cash on the balance sheet and ignoring any potential tax issues with the repatriation of that cash apples pe ratio drops to just 00NUMBER00 a pessimistic valuation to say the least. the bull argument for apple is simple. with the iphone remaining both wildly popular and wildly profitable for apple even nearly nine years after the original was launched and with other apple products and services reinforcing the ecosystem making it difficult for consumers to switch continued success of the iphone seems likely. add in future products like the rumored apple car as well as a valuation thats so low that apple doesnt even need to grow  in order to provide solid returns and you have what looks like a value investors dream. despite  apple stock  appearing to be a no brainer based on valuation i wont be buying the stock for one simple reason i cant predict what apple will look like 00NUMBER00 years from now. important questions    in order to justify buying apple stock today investors need to convince themselves that the companys profits will at worst decline slowly in the coming years. two things need to occur for this scenario to play outthe iphone needs to largely maintain its market share and its profitability. during the fiscal fourth quarter iphone sales accounted for 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue and likely a higher percentage of operating profit. new products some already released like the apple watch and others only hypothetical like the apple car need to generate enough revenue and profit to counteract any declines in iphone sales. while its easy to simply extrapolate based on the past and assume that the iphone will continue to generate outsize profits for apple i think that investors are ignoring the full range of possible outcomes. before buying apple stock all investors should consider the following questionstwo year contracts are now mostly dead in the united states a market where the iphone enjoys a market share in excess of 00NUMBER00. with the full cost of high end smartphones no longer obfuscated by subsidies how will the high end smartphone market be affectedon the same note two year contracts created an incentive for consumers to upgrade phones every two years. the total monthly bill remained the same regardless of whether a new phone was bought and a steep discount that brought the price of a new iphone down to 00NUMBER00 made upgrading an affordable proposition. without contracts a consumer financing a phone would see their total bill decline once the phone is paid off creating a disincentive to upgrade since it would increase their total monthly bill. how will this shift in incentives affect the average time between upgradesthe quality of smartphones particularly mid range smartphones has improved dramatically over the past few years. today a smartphone that retails for 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 like the nexus 00NUMBER00 is likely more than enough for the vast majority of users. what percentage of smartphone users will remain willing to pay twice as much for an iphone or any high end smartphone and will that be enough for apple to maintain its market share and profitsif a combination of the end of two year contracts and mid range smartphones increasing in quality leads to consumers on average upgrading their phones less frequently how will this affect both the smartphone market as a whole and apples financial performancewill consumers continue to upgrade to the newest iphone as the relative improvements between generations get smaller have we reached the point where adding more pixels a better camera or a faster processor wont be enough to convince the average iphone user to upgrade is there any real innovation left in smartphone hardwarethe pc market has become increasingly commoditized over the years with large pc manufacturers generating low single digit operating margins at best. the outlier is apple which is far more profitable thanks to the premium prices of its macs and macbooks. however this premium strategy limits apples pc unit market share which was 00NUMBER00 globally during the third quarter. why would the smartphone market look any different than the pc market in the long runthe smartphone category barely existed 00NUMBER00 years ago. ten years from now will smartphones be supplanted by some other type of device how likely is it that apple is the company to develop ithow will a slowdown in the chinese economy affect demand for high end smartphones in china one of apples most important marketsa range of possibilities    i dont know the answer to all of these questions but there seems to be a lot of things that can go wrong for apple in the coming years. in my opinion assuming that the company will be able to maintain its current level of profits in the long run seems like a dangerous assumption to make. i think that the most likely scenario is that apples profits decline over the next 00NUMBER00 years the only question is by how much. theres a chance that apples profits completely collapse driven by a combination of the points i mentioned above and perhaps some others that no one has yet considered. theres also a chance that apples profits rise substantially with none of the points above mattering much at all or perhaps driven by the overwhelming success of a new product. the probabilities of these extreme scenarios are small but theyre certainly not zero. even if apples profits do decline over the next 00NUMBER00 years investors can still achieve a positive return driven by a low valuation huge amounts of cash for share buybacks and dividend payments. the relevant question though is this is apple stock likely to provide a return that is higher than that of the market as a whole over the long run its impossible to know the answer to that question but my best guess is that it wont all things considered. let me be clear im not an apple doomsayer. im not predicting that the company will fall apart or that iphone sales will plummet tomorrow. i dont know how iphone sales will fare in the coming years or for that matter how the smartphone market will evolve and thats the main reason why i wont be buying the stock. investing is a game of probabilities and buying a stock based strictly on the best case scenario is a recipe for disappointing results. the range of possible outcomes is vast and each must be considered not just the ones that we want to believe. for me apple stock is far from a no brainer despite its tantalizing valuation. the chance that apples earnings fall substantially over the next decade is simply too high for me to be comfortable buying the stock. i could be wrong maybe the iphone will remain a cash cow indefinitely and well all be cruising around in apple cars in 00NUMBER00. but that seems like wishful thinking to me. the next

battle with samsung   apple  has now won an injunction that prohibits samsung from selling certain devices in the u. s. this is part of the original patent lawsuit that apple won in 00NUMBER00 has still continued to progress through appeals courts over the years. the main patent that remains relevant is the controversial slide to unlock patent which has already been invalidated in the european union but is still technically valid in the u. s. however the patent only covers how slide to unlock is implemented and not the functionality itself. the only samsung phone models that are affected are the admire galaxy nexus galaxy note galaxy note ii galaxy s ii galaxy s ii epic 00NUMBER00 galaxy s ii skyrocket galaxy s iii and stratosphere. does it matter    this injunction is more of a symbolic victory than a functional one that will affect market dynamics. samsung and other android oems have already learned to design around the specific implementations covered by the slide to unlock patent and the related smartphone models are so old that a sales injunction wont affect current sales in any meaningful way. meanwhile apple has made it clear that it is moving away from legislative strategies. the patent lawsuits were initiated under steve jobs and tim cook has expressed that he hates legislation and the only real winners of prolonged legal battles are the lawyers that each side hires. none of the court decisions have ever had much impact on competition and apple hasnt initiated any patent lawsuits in years. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest

line that started it all for apple   is largely forgotten nowadays by analysts. this is ironic given that mac sales provided apples second largest source of revenue last fiscal year outpacing the ipad which dropped to no. 00NUMBER00. if a recent report from gartner  is true moreover apples mac line is also bucking the broader decline in the market for personal computers. pc sales continue to struggle but mac fights the trend    to be clear its not a great time for the pc industry. overall the presence of capable substitutes smartphones and tablets amid an increasingly saturated market have weighed on unit shipment volumes. overall gartners preliminary results show that the pc market declined to 00NUMBER00 million units an 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00. the fourth quarter was no better with an 00NUMBER00 drop in worldwide units sold compared to the year ago period. out of the six named vendors only apple stymied the decline by registering an increase. apple shipped 00NUMBER00 million units in the last three months 00NUMBER00 or apples fiscal first quarter. that amounted to a 00NUMBER00 over last years 00NUMBER00 million units. this is nothing to brag about especially from a company that grew its top line 00NUMBER00 last fiscal year but it does show how apples high end value proposition offsets the otherwise secular decline. apples mac line is not what investors will be watching jan. 00NUMBER00 that apples mac line is the companys no. 00NUMBER00 business is technically correct and the line is growing in importance as the ipad withers but statistics dont tell the whole story. this is because rankings dont address scale. although apples mac line is the companys second largest division it still only contributed 00NUMBER00 to apples total revenue in the 00NUMBER00 fiscal year. apples iphone line by contrast accounted for 00NUMBER00. more recently the tune on wall street has been decidedly negative in regards to the iphones sales growth. in fact many analysts expect apple to sell fewer units this fiscal year than last. morgan stanley  s katy huberty expects apple to ship 00NUMBER00 fewer units. if correct apple will need more than 00NUMBER00 growth from its mac division to stop its top line from sinking. but heres the rub sagging revenue and earnings seem to be priced into its stocks valuation. right now the company trades at a price to earnings ratio of nearly half sp 00NUMBER00. on a bottom line relative value basis the company appears to be priced for armageddon   not for a mild decline in its net income which could be offset on a per share basis thanks to its buyback program. the fact that apple outperformed the broader pc market in units shipment growth is a good sign and a testament to cupertinos brand cachet. however its not what investors will be looking for come its earnings release on jan. 00NUMBER00. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event

and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  india is still not a fully tapped smartphone market for apple aapl but that could change soon. apple has reportedly filed an application with the department of industrial policy and promotion dipp to open its own apple branded stores in india. “we have just received apple’s proposal. we are examining it” said amitabh kant dipp secretary as reported by the economic times. although apple has not disclosed the amount of investment in its application it has also sought approval to sell products directly online from the government. currently apple products are sold in india through “premium resellers who run exclusive brand stores under the franchise model. ” apple has been operating in india via the franchise model as the indian policies didn’t allow foreign direct investment fdi in single brand retail. however in november 00NUMBER00 a new set of guidelines by the government eased some of such regulations. according to the press release on the revamped fdi policy “it is seen that in certain high technology segments it is not possible for retail entity to comply with the sourcing norms the extant fdi policy on single brand retail trading mandated that sourcing of 00NUMBER00 of the value of goods purchased would be reckoned from the date of receipt of fdi. to provide opportunity to such single brand entities it has been decided that in case of ‘state of art’ and ‘cutting edge technology’ sourcing norms can be relaxed subject to government approval. ” the revised policy also allows permitted entities to undertake e commerce activities. ”this has paved the way for companies like apple to set up its own store and sell products directly online albeit subject to approval. india has never been a priority market for apple. in fact most of its products were launched many days after their us launch. according to a business standard report the gap between the launch of iphone 00NUMBER00 in the us and india was 00NUMBER00 days it reduced to around 00NUMBER00 days when iphone 00NUMBER00 was launched. the time gap reduced further to 00NUMBER00 days for 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 while 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus debuted almost around the same time as in the us. the “shrinking time” reflects india’s increased absorption of iphones. the trend has been changing especially since 00NUMBER00 when apple decided to sell iphones via distributors. the wall street journal reported that india despite being among the fastest growing economies remained a small market for apple products. the iphone was initially sold in india through telecom companies who clubbed these devices with data plans. the report further rationalized the reason for the poor sales it said “as indian telecom companies don’t subsidize the cost of iphones as in the u. s. these sales have been limited. some independent mobile phone retailers which buy from the providers also sell iphones. but distribution has been limited mainly to large towns. ”apple changed its strategy and attempted to cater to a wider audience through specialized distribution companies. this decision showed apple’s interest in the indian market a step which was taken to gain a foothold in the smartphone market than targeting profit margins. under a distributor model the company’s profit margin gets compromised as a fee is paid to its partners at each level. a comment by tim cook in the wall street journal highlighted his interest and issues in india “you know of course i love india but i believe that apple has some higher potential in the intermediate term in some other countries. we have a business there that business is growing but the sort of the multilayer distribution there really adds to the cost of getting products to market. ”india’s importance has grown manifold ever since its change of strategy in 00NUMBER00. the results filed with the registrar of companies showed that apple’s sale in india crossed the 00NUMBER00 billion mark during fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. apple realizes india’s potential and has been pushing hard to open its own retail stores. it even collaborated with croma a consumer electronics chain owned by tata in october 00NUMBER00 to have a ‘mini’ apple store within the croma stores at five mumbai stores. final wordindia is not only the world’s second largest telecommunications market and the home to the third highest number of internet users in the world but it is also branded as “one of the bright spots in the global economy” by the imf chief. the indian economy is projected to grow at 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 as well as 00NUMBER00 by the recent imf world economic outlook update. now these statistics when combined with the rising income and consumerism of its population make india a very good market for apple’s innovative products. if apple gets approval from the indian regulators it would help the company cut out multi layered costs involved in the process of getting its products to customers thus boosting margins. it would facilitate a deeper penetration into india’s smartphone market which would pep up sales which is something much needed at a time when china is witnessing a slowdown an issue which has been weighing on its stock price for some time now. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily

views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  source skullcandy. one of last weeks biggest losers was skullcandy   which shed 00NUMBER00 of its value after hosing down its earlier guidance. the maker of headphones and other accessories for consumer electronics products had a rough holiday quarter. net sales for the quarter ending in december were essentially flat with the prior years levels or up 00NUMBER00 if you back out currency fluctuations. skullcandy had originally been targeting a 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 advance or up 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 on a currency neutral basis. the news gets worse as we work our way down the income statement. the sales shortfall was largely the result of the competitive marketplace where cutthroat pricing drove margins lower. gross margins also took a hit as the growth in sales of lower margin video gaming headsets offset the surprising decline in higher margin headphones in the u. s. market. add it all up and skullcandy is eyeing a profit of 00NUMBER00 a share to 00NUMBER00 a share for the critical fourth quarter after backing out a one time charge related to a thorny issue with its largest chinese distributor. thats a far cry from where it was in november forecasting as much as 00NUMBER00 a share in net income. its been a rough run for skullcandys retail investors. the company went public at 00NUMBER00 in the summer of 00NUMBER00. it has gone on to shed 00NUMBER00 of its value hitting yet another all time low in yesterdays intraday trading. skullcandy is gaining ground with its wireless headphone products. its astro line of products for diehard gamers continues to gain traction. the problem is that its flagship earbuds and headphones business is in a funk. the company got its start getting extreme sports enthusiasts to embrace its edgy designs. like most makers of audio accessories skullcandy can thank apple  for its initial success. it was the 00NUMBER00 release of the ipod  followed two years later by the launch of apples iconic itunes music store that opened the market for third party headphones. apples ipod and eventual iphone came with a bland earbud sending folks to skullcandy and other third party providers for more stylish listening gear. however ipod sales and the market for other portable media players peaked a couple of years ago. with apple reportedly experiencing a slowdown in iphone sales its easy to see why the appetite for skullcandys original product is diminishing. the market for streaming music is growing and thats good especially because apple is making a big splash there but this also finds headphones competing against connected cars and bluetooth speakers when folks dont have to keep tunes to themselves. skullcandy isnt toast. its still profitable. it has a clean balance sheet. its also potential buyout bait but dont look for apple to be a potential buyer because it already has beats on its books. last weeks plunge was rough but as long as skullcandy remains profitable its hard to fathom the stock heading too much lower. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

tight lipped about shipments no one really knows. however that hasnt stopped a host of research firms from providing their best guesses ahead of apples earnings next week. according to one well respected researcher apple watch shipments continue to dominate the budding smartwatch market. another winner for apple    according to tech research firm juniper research the apple watch dominated the budding smartwatch landscape in 00NUMBER00 for the majority of markets shipments. juniper estimates that the global smartwatch space grew shipment volumes to more than 00NUMBER00 million units last year with the apple watch producing 00NUMBER00 million of those shipments. moreover junipers estimates sit appreciably lower than other prominent research firms. for example leading research firm idc estimated in december that total smartwatch shipments topped 00NUMBER00 million last year and of those apple shipped an estimated 00NUMBER00 million watches. even if junipers numbers prove more accurate than idcs the apple watch has enjoyed the strongest initial sales of any apple device. apples massive installed base today makes quickly ramping up sales easier than it was for the iphone or the ipad. and such performance speaks well for the devices long term prospects especially when signs point to marked improvements coming with this years apple watch 00NUMBER00. source apple. the best is yet to come    ive long maintained that the smartwatchs greatest potential lies in fitness tracking and health monitoring an area the first apple watch performs nicely in though it fails to usher in any truly breakthrough technology. however a number of moves on the companys part suggest that like the iphone before it the apple watch 00NUMBER00 could be what realizes the devices massive long term potential. one of the most prevalent rumors surrounding the second generation watch claims that apple plans to introduce a series of interchangeable  smart bands   that will enable advanced biometrics functionality to monitor blood pressure blood oxygen levels users respiratory rates and body temperature. these are of course only rumors. however a number of anecdotes suggest that apple is indeed interested in advancing the watchs health tracking chops. the first generation apple watch includes what many believe to be a hidden diagnostics port behind the area where the bottom watch strap connects with the watchs case. though its ultimate use remains a matter of speculation the hidden six pin data port appears designed to transmit data and power between the watch casing and exterior straps. given apples detailed approach to design the inclusion of this data port points to its eventually playing a role in the devices long term functionality. whats more apples continued hiring of medical technology talent also suggests that it plans to include improved health monitoring function in the apple watch 00NUMBER00 though comments  from ceo tim cook also triggered rumors that apple could have a separate medical related device in development as well. at the same time a recent look at apples job postings revealed several health related positions explicitly focused on further developing the watchs health related services. so while 00NUMBER00 million shipments for apple would represent a notable achievement for the worlds largest tech firm i believe its next generation smartwatch will be the device that finally unlocks the form factors life changing potential. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something

ownership of single brand retail stores. the only way around that rule was to source at least 00NUMBER00 of the products locally. way back in 00NUMBER00 the policy was amended and allowed for 00NUMBER00 foreign ownership up from 00NUMBER00 foreign ownership if and only if this local sourcing requirement was met. this is largely why apple  has never been able to open up its own apple stores in the country instead relying on third party premium resellers. while apples supply chain expectedly sources a lot of components and labor from neighboring china it sources nearly nothing from india. that may all be about to change. hear me out    the indian government has recently acknowledged that it will consider retail store applications that do not meet the local sourcing criteria on a case by case basis. apple has taken advantage of the opportunity and filed an application to set up a branded retail store but its unclear how many locations apple is hoping to open. apple also overhauled  its indian operations a few years ago in an attempt to grow its presence in the worlds second most populous nation. the mac maker expanded distribution to a greater number of small franchisee owned store within a store shops and saw iphone shipments soar. that increase was off a relatively small base but overall the changes were working. lessons learned from china    after china india is expected to become the next growth market for smartphones but lower income levels make apples premium pricing prohibitively expensive. archrival samsung dominates the indian market with a wide array of low cost smartphone models grabbing an estimated 00NUMBER00 share in the third quarter of 00NUMBER00 according to idc. local vendors micromax intex and lava also carry a lot of weight as does chinas lenovo. there were 00NUMBER00 million units shipped into the market during that quarter and most of these models had 00NUMBER00 inch displays or larger and cost less 00NUMBER00. much like china just a few years ago but to a lesser extent today there are a lot  of first time smartphone buyers in india. apple will likely implement a similar strategy where it attempts to address lower price points with older models. for instance apple was still selling the aging iphone 00NUMBER00 in volume in china as recently as 00NUMBER00. the iphone maker knows that once a consumer adopts ios the consumer is very  likely to stick around and eventually upgrade to a newer model. potentially opening branded apple stores gives apple much greater control over the purchase experience as well as warranty service. apple may also be able to offer job creation for leverage since it would need to employ locals at any retail locations. the indian market is going to be too big to ignore. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats

flickr user jon skillingwhen it comes to geographies much has been written about apple  s increasing reliance on growth from china. and that makes sense as the country went from not even being listed as an individual operating segment in the companys 00NUMBER00 to being the companys second largest segment by operating income. the combination of a large population and increasing gdp per capita have quickly turned the predominantly labor market for apple into a nation of customers. more recently though a slowing growth outlook from the middle kingdom has scared investors as beijing reported 00NUMBER00 rate fell to 00NUMBER00 below the countrys official growth target of 00NUMBER00. according to the international monetary fund the country is expected to slow further in the upcoming years with forecasts of 00NUMBER00 growth in 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. whether this will affect apples sales path in the country is another question entirely but it will be hard for apple to maintain the 00NUMBER00 revenue growth rate in the country it had last year. however apples next potential growth opportunity bears potential remarkably similar to chinas as its a heavily populated developing asian nation with a comparatively high gdp growth rate. that country is slated to be the fastest growing country next year with the imf estimating 00NUMBER00 gdp growth  that country is india. an apple store in india    recently apple filed an application to bring an apple store to india less than three months after the government relaxed rules relating to single brand retailing. before november single brand retailers with more than 00NUMBER00 foreign ownership needed to source 00NUMBER00 of their products in the country in order to open shop. in addition these retailers were not allowed to use e commerce pushing apple to partner with a network of franchisee owned stores to sell its products. one downside of this arrangement is that apple has limited control of the outlay and oversight that makes apples retail stores the envy of the retailing world with its stores responsible for the most sales per square foot. apple stores function as both a shopping channel and as high end marketing. therefore bringing a retail outlet to the country makes sense according to a form the company filed with the government in early 00NUMBER00 apple reportedly increased its revenue in india over 00NUMBER00 from the prior year and now does more than 00NUMBER00 billion of revenue annually in the country. in the fourth quarter ceo tim cook mentioned he was impressed with progress in india and said the move to build an apple store if accepted by the indian government should increase exposure and grow future revenue in the country. this is probably a longer term project    while india is a great deal like china in many respects. theres one key aspect where the country falls far short of its slightly larger brethren gdp per capita. the measurement which is a close proxy for the average income per person on a yearly basis shows the country comes up far short. for 00NUMBER00 international monetary fund estimated the average gdp per capita in china was 00NUMBER00. this is well below the united states figure of nearly 00NUMBER00 but enough for upper income consumers to buy apples high end products. for india however the gdp per capita figure is 00NUMBER00 a 00NUMBER00 iphone purchase a large part of a workers annual income. of course this gdp per capita figure is an average with wide variances in a country of nearly 00NUMBER00 billion people. recently there are faint signs of a growing middle class in india with the countrys smartphone market expected to become the worlds second largest pushing past the united states 00NUMBER00. its estimated that apple has less than a 00NUMBER00 share of indias smartphone market. if apples able to continue to grow its top line 00NUMBER00 in the country india could be the next china for apple investors looking for growth. that may sound far fetched but who would have thought five years ago that china would be apples second largest marketthe next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

blockbuster year ago quarter well find out on tuesday. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. it would be difficult to overstate the importance of apples earnings report on tuesday. as the companys first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which is the fourth calendar quarter 00NUMBER00 the period captures a snippet of its business during the important holiday quarter. and investors are particularly honed in on this years report as the company is up against its monstrous year ago quarter in which iphone unit sales soared 00NUMBER00 compared to the same period in the year before. when the results are released here are three metrics worth looking over. iphone sales   as always the market will be watching apples reported iphone sales closely. now representing about 00NUMBER00 of revenue this product segments performance has a huge impact on apples overall results. so how many iphones could apple ship during 00NUMBER00 on average analysts are expecting apple to deliver 00NUMBER00 million iphones according to a poll by fortune. this represents 00NUMBER00 year over year growth in iphone unit sales. investors can get a decent preview of apples expectations for 00NUMBER00 iphone sales by examining its expectations for the quarters revenue. when apple reported its fourth quarter results it said it expected first quarter revenue to rise between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter. with iphone sales representing the largest chunk of apples revenue this guidance implies the company expected similar performance from its iphone segment. earnings per share    with apples revenue growth likely to moderate to low single digits for the holiday quarter it will be interesting to see what rate the company can grow its eps. investors should expect eps growth to track ahead of revenue and net income growth driven by its significant share repurchase program. consider the difference between apples fourth quarter net income and eps growth on a 00NUMBER00 increase in net income between the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 and the same period in 00NUMBER00 its eps leaped 00NUMBER00. revenue in apples other products segment    when apple reports results many investors will likely look for clues about how well its 00NUMBER00 launched smartwatch the apple watch is faring in the market. apple watch. image source apple. revenue for apple watch is buried in a segment it calls other products making it difficult to recognize exactly how well the product is performing. but based on some comments from management about its other products category during earnings calls chances are that most of the year over year growth reported in the segment for 00NUMBER00 can be attributed to the apple watch giving investors a vague idea of how the new product may be performing. in apples fourth quarter other products revenue increased about 00NUMBER00 or by about 00NUMBER00 billion. the company attributed the increase to the apple watch during the fourth quarter earnings call. estimating apple watch sales for the holiday quarter is difficult. the product is a bit of a wildcard as its the first time the device is sold during the quarter. but id say its safe to predict sales of about 00NUMBER00 billion. assuming apple sees some growth in its other products segment outside of the apple watch thanks to a recently revamped apple tv its other products revenue for the quarter will likely have to be 00NUMBER00 billion if the company really does record around 00NUMBER00 billion in apple watch revenue during the quarter. investors can check in on apples results on its investor relations page after market close on jan. 00NUMBER00. the company will also host a live earnings call at 00NUMBER00 p. m. et. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company

watch  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  at this point it is widely believed that apple  will see its very first year over year iphone shipment declines during fiscal 00NUMBER00 after many years of straight unit increases. to make matters worse though a recent research report from ubs analyst steve milunovich suggests that not only are the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus not selling as well as had been hoped but apples mix of products is turning out to be poorer than expected. indeed more customers are apparently opting for older generation iphones than in previous cycles per milunovich. i believe that this fairly adverse downward mix shift could have been at the very least mitigated if not downright avoided   if apple had done just one simple thing with its most recent iphones. new displays could have made the new phones compelling enough    unlike many of its peers in the premium smartphone space apple tends to recycle the new displays that it introduces in new number iphones in the s cycle phones that it releases in the following year. when the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus first came out they had quite excellent displays displaymates dr. raymond soneira claimed that these were at the time the best smartphone lcds hed ever tested. a year later the displays found on the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 are still good   but they are hardly the best in the business. the iphone 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 pixel display pales in comparison to even what many mid range android phones feature these days. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus comes with a sharper 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 pixel display but it lags even the smaller iphone display in terms of color reproduction and contrast ratio. at any rate the problem here is that when a customer goes to say an apple store or another retail store that sells iphones and sees the two phones side by side there is no immediate wow factor that stands out. the displays are largely identical so what the average joe shopping for an iphone sees are two smartphones that look pretty much the same. of course we know that the newer iphones have better specs under the hood a faster touch id and 00NUMBER00 touch but the benefits of those features arent immediately obvious to the person who just walked into the apple store. theyre features that users come to appreciate after  buying the device. however since there is very little visible difference between the two phones and the newer iphone is actually thicker the run of the mill smartphone buyer may well think that going with an older cheaper model that seems pretty much the same is the right move. i believe that if apple had upgraded the displays on the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus this apparent product mix problem could very well have been mitigated. why the obsession with displays    ideally apple would introduce both a newmore attractive industrial design and  a new display with each new generation. however i can understand that the former may not be all that feasible so well give apple a pass on that. however with respect to display technology the competition iterates at a yearly clip so there is really no excuse for apple to use the same panels for two years. at any rate my hypothesis is that if the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 had displays that were superior to the prior generation then users would probably notice an immediate difference between older  and newer generation iphones. the iphone 00NUMBER00 display is noticeably less sharp than both the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the various mid range to high end androids available on the market. even if the 00NUMBER00 display had merely been sharper with no other image quality enhancements it could have been a nice selling point. with the 00NUMBER00 plus id argue that the display is quite sharp so the main area where i would like to have seen improvements would have been in color accuracy bringing it at least on par with the iphone 00NUMBER00 in this regard. apple could then have saved the resolution increase for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. lets hope apple remedies this mistake with 00NUMBER00 plus    at this point its obviously too late for apple to salvage the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle. investors should brace themselves for year over year unit sales declines and for the distinct possibility of  average selling price declines during the iphone current cycle. i expect that from a product perspective iphone 00NUMBER00 will be a very large leap froward  from the iphone 00NUMBER00 both internally and externally so apple will have that tailwind working for it during fiscal 00NUMBER00. the key for apple though will be to make sure that when it launches the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus  in late 00NUMBER00 have every reason in the world to buy those phones  instead of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus if they can afford to do so. that in my view will mean including an updated display. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00

for 00NUMBER00 probably receive the most attention in the media after the company reports results for its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 week investors shouldnt overlook the companys earnings call following the report. while apple is known for its secrecy when it comes to future product plans apple ceo tim cook does often take the time during the call to discuss important topics such a the long term potential for particular product categories and analysis of growth and opportunities in different geographic segments. apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. here are three questions that cook may be asked during the call along with some relevant background. will iphone sales continue to grow   analysts on average are expecting apples iphone sales to increase just 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter in 00NUMBER00. while well find out exactly how many iphones apple was able to deliver during the holiday quarter when apple reports results on tuesday chances are the growth wont be impressive as the company only guided for low single digit percentage growth in total revenue. this slow growth is a concerning for some investors as its a significant deceleration from recent growth. year over year growth in iphone sales in the prior quarter was 00NUMBER00. does cook believe this slowdown is only temporary or 00NUMBER00 be the year of peak iphone sales for applecould apple watch evolve into a major product for apple   currently apples newest product category the apple watch  is still too small to matter. the company likely generated between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue from the device during its most recent quarter. this represents just about 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue. apple watch. image source apple. does cook see the apple watch turning into a major product category for the company perhaps even surpassing its mac and ipad businesses which now account for 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 of the companys total revenue respectivelyfurthermore if apple watch sales do take off does apple see the product being a major contributor to the companys bottom line or in other words could the apple watch eventually boast profit margins that rival the iphonewill china remain a catalyst   china was a key catalyst for apple in fiscal 00NUMBER00. year over year revenue attributable to apples greater china segment in 00NUMBER00 for instance was up 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. and apple said in its fourth quarter earnings call that iphone sales in mainland china soared 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. keep in mind that apples greater china segment is not only growing rapidly but it also represents a huge chunk of apples business at 00NUMBER00 of revenue. so the rapid growth apple has been witnessing in china recently truly does represent a critical catalyst for the company. is cook still betting china represents a growth opportunity for the companyin the companys last earnings call cook seemed confident china would remain a key growth driver over the long haul. but an update on his thoughts on the potential for china now that the company is deeper into its latest iphone cycle could yield new perspective. apple will release its first quarter results after market close on tuesday. stay tuned at the motley fool for analysis of the results as well as for a close look at important takeaways from the companys

apple. over the past year one recurring theme for apple  and other major multinationals has been the impact of a strengthening dollar. the u. s. dollar continues to rise putting pressure on international revenue for these companies. since two thirds of apples revenue is generated abroad this is absolutely an important risk factor for investors to keep an eye on. the mac maker primarily uses foreign exchange derivatives to hedge its exposure but at times it has been forced to raise prices  when currency fluctuations prove to be greater than expected. this is particularly true for the chinese yuan since the u. s. dollar continues to rise against the yuan and apples greater china segment is now 00NUMBER00 of total revenue on a trailing 00NUMBER00 month basis. usdcny exchange rate. image source xecom. but apples hedges are only good for so long since derivative contracts eventually expire and need to be replaced. navigating foreign exchange risk is only going to get trickier from here on out. guidance is better than it looks    for example apples guidance for the fourth quarter seemed a little soft because the growth forecast incorporated a foreign exchange hit of 00NUMBER00 percentage points. thats a massive hit when were talking about a revenue base as large as apples. at the midpoint revenue is only expected to rise by 00NUMBER00 but on a constant currency basis tim cook said it would actually jump 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. when you acknowledge these foreign exchange headwinds apples guidance actually looks that much more impressive especially on the profitability side. the company expects gross margin to be 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 even after taking a currency hit. i agree with cfo luca maestri calling the guidance incredible in light of these factors. party like its 00NUMBER00 currency hedges are typically in place for upwards 00NUMBER00 months. so part of its derivatives portfolio will be rolling off this year. on the last conference call maestri noted that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that over time during the course of 00NUMBER00 that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels. in a recent research note morgan stanley  analyst katy huberty pointed out that apple recognized 00NUMBER00 in gains from all of its hedges throughout fiscal 00NUMBER00. this is the total that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income net of tax expenses. that represented 00NUMBER00 of pre tax profit. volatility risk    the fundamental purpose of derivatives is to mitigate risk associated with volatility by transferring that risk. forecasting is already hard enough but increased volatility just makes it that much harder. so even as apple continues to expand its hedging strategies this task is only going to become more difficult since currency volatility will likely continue to rise. global markets are freaking out largely because of china and the yuan is expected to be volatile throughout 00NUMBER00. that being said chinas central bank has said that it will try to mitigate and limit volatility in the yuan as best as it can but the yuan still looks like it will remain weak this year. apple has a world class no pun intended corporate finance team to navigate the tumultuous global financial markets but its not an easy job. the

and it seems safe to say things will only get more interesting with the motion chip specialists fiscal third quarter 00NUMBER00 report next wednesday. for perspective invensense stock last skyrocketed nearly 00NUMBER00 a single day following its strong fiscal second quarter report in october. at the time the market rejoiced as the companys previously disappointing guidance proved too conservative. in addition to its successful ramp of high volume production of a new 00NUMBER00 axis motiontracking device for a major north american customer results were driven by continued expansion of invensenses differentiated software enabled sensor platform which in turn allowed the company to drive more content to its customer base and solidify other 00NUMBER00 axis design wins. but with shares down around 00NUMBER00 so far in 00NUMBER00 as of this writing you can bet invensense would like to prove the naysayers wrong with another great report next week. here are four things ill be watching closely when it hits the wiresthe headline numbers    the first thing the market will hone in on are the usual headline numbers. invensense for its part told investors during last quarters call to expect fiscal third quarter revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million compared to 00NUMBER00 million in the same year ago period and adjusted earnings per share of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00 per share. this might not seem particularly impressive at first glance. but keep in mind when these expectations were issued ceo behrooz abdi explained that while the company has a pretty good understanding of anticipated volumes from its current largest customers it also has enjoyed significant traction in what management calls the other bucket comprised primarily of products targeting the burgeoning internet of things market. if that were to go well abdi teased that would probably give us a little bit of upside. the apple effect    speaking of large clients just two companies individually accounted for at least 00NUMBER00 of invensenses sales last quarter and they were almost certainly apple  and samsung  at 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 of total revenue respectively. it should be unsurprising then that invensense stock plunged between mid december and early january not only due to the broader market pullback but also amid reports that apple was cutting back component orders  for its latest iphone lineup. to invensenses credit abdi did suggest last quarter that thanks to its success proving out real use cases in mobile the company is poised to expand meaningfully to applications spanning a number of vertical markets that offer significant new opportunity for growth and diversification. whats more he noted while 00NUMBER00 of invensenses revenue currently comes from the mobile segment 00NUMBER00 of its new design win pipeline is outside of mobile. however that doesnt change the fact invensense still bears an outsized reliance on mobile. and if apple is pulling back component orders due to light demand invensense will almost certainly suffer as a result. macro headwindsguidance    on a broader scale investors should also listen for comments from management on the extent to which the current macroeconomic environment could hamper growth in the near term. recall for example that invensense shares plunged two quarters ago after the company turned in better than expected results but opted to issue conservative guidance  given concerns over macro issues involving fledgling growth in china and consumer sentiment in the united states. to be fair that guidance ultimately proved to be too  conservative. but given the current state of global economic uncertainty i wont be shocked if invensense once again chooses to play it safe with guidance for the coming quarter. for perspective wall streets consensus estimates call for revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter to rise a modest 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 million while earnings are expected to be flat at roughly 00NUMBER00 per share. while it certainly shouldnt be a huge concern for long term investors if invensense chooses to exercise caution looking forward our fickle market may not take kindly to such prudence. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent

copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  one thing that people especially investors really  hate is uncertainty. thats in my view precisely why shares of idevice maker apple   which has profited immensely from the growth of the modern smartphone trade at a meager 00NUMBER00 times trailing 00NUMBER00 month earnings and about 00NUMBER00 times analyst consensus estimates for fiscal year 00NUMBER00. the fact that apple is so darn cheap   even more so once one backs out the net cash that the idevice maker has on its balance sheet has been cited as a key reason that investors should buy apple here. i understand this argument and i understand it well but i think that apple falls into the category of stocks thats cheap for a reason. that reason as you might have guessed is the uncertainty  that surrounds apples long term future. iphone sales decline is downright scary    ahead of the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle there were widespread fears that apple might struggle to see growth in iphone shipments or in the really  bearish scenario a slight decline. however multiple credible data points from various news reports and from the financial results of major suppliers suggest that apple will not only not  see iphone growth during fiscal year 00NUMBER00 but that it will actually see quite substantial year over year declines for the year. in a previous article   i estimated that iphone sales could come in anywhere 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 million at the midpoint of the range. at least two recent analyst estimates one from credit suisse the other from raymond james published after my own have come down to around 00NUMBER00 million. given that the vast majority of apples revenue comes from iphone all of apples other businesses combined dont even come close to iphone this is downright disturbing. so wheres the uncertainty    the uncertainty here lies in what to expect for the future of the iphone. what absolutely nobody on the planet knows right now is whether this is the beginning of a structural decline in iphone sales or if this represents a mere blip as a result of either the tough year over year comparison or gasp  competitive pressures. everybody has their own personal hypotheses i certainly have mine but investors wont have a good read on what the truth is until apple launches its next generation iphone in the fall of 00NUMBER00. what i believe will make things quite uncomfortable for  apple stock  holders beyond the fact that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus arent doing well when they are arguably the best smartphones on the market is that the competition will be launching their responses to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the coming months. this means that apple not only has to deal with the issues that hurt it in late 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 but its products will have to contend with much improved devices from the competition potentially leading to market segment share loss. now in an environment in which apple is posting steady year over year growth the fears around market share loss wouldnt be all that great since apple will have delivered the financial goods to investors before the competition

tim cook has to say about the current iphone demand environment and his views about the future of the iphone on the companys upcoming earnings call. although even he cant predict the future he has enough visibility into the iphone product pipeline to know if there are any big changesinnovations coming that could help to stimulate demand. that said id rather wait for the dust to settle and for the first evidence that things will be ok for the iphone business to appear before buying in. waiting will probably mean that ill get in at a price thats higher than the bottom but thats a price im

00NUMBER00. image source apple. one of the products that apple  likely has up its sleeve for the rumored march event is a refreshed 00NUMBER00 inch iphone. there have been plenty of rumors and leaks that suggest that this device is in the pipeline which makes plenty of sense since there is still a respectable market for relatively smaller smartphones. not everyone wants a 00NUMBER00 inch to 00NUMBER00 inch display. most industry watchers have just taken to calling it an iphone 00NUMBER00 but a 00NUMBER00 suggests it might have a different name altogether. iphone 00NUMBER00 to mark gurman the new 00NUMBER00 inch model is supposed to be called the iphone 00NUMBER00. the se reportedly either refers to special edition or the e could simply indicate that its an enhanced variant of the iphone 00NUMBER00. if you recall that the s has always stood for speed then that would suggest speed enhanced or something along those lines. the 00NUMBER00 is expected to feature a similar overall design with most of the upgrades being internal such as a faster processer and better cameras. it may also include an nfc chip to enable apple pay which is currently only available on the iphone 00NUMBER00 or later. live photos is also said to be supported but not  a pressure sensitive touch capable of 00NUMBER00 touch. instead of chamfers the 00NUMBER00 may use curved sides like the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. an iphone by any other name would sound better    ive discussed how apple eventually needs to transition away  from numbered iphone naming conventions for the sake of brand sustainability and longevity. yet if this rumor proves true it seems that apple is digging deeper  and entrenching itself in the practice. one of apples brand strengths has always been naming simplicity. while some other consumer electronics companies refer to their products by confusing alphanumeric model numbers apple has long shied away from the practice. it does use model identifiers to distinguish specific variants and internal codenames the 00NUMBER00 is codenamed 00NUMBER00 but from a consumer perspective its always been pretty straightforward. apple doesnt use numbers in its mac lineup instead referring to computers by model year and display size. why cant it use something similar with the iphonedont just take my word for it. ken segall was the ad consultant who came up with the name imac nearly two decades ago and helped apple come up with its branding and product naming strategies for years. he condemned the iphone naming convention way back in april 00NUMBER00 saying the incremental s updates were needless complicated from a product branding point of view. segalls main complaint was that the s models indicate that its an incremental year and doesnt inspire confidence in the products new features. in his words apple has an impressive track record when it comes to product naming and clarity has always played a very big role. yet here we are discussing the possibility of apple appending a second modifier to the name. will we eventually get a third how about an x for xtrathe next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and

leveraged even further by the companys share repurchase program. but what was particularly impressive about apples rapid growth during this period was its improving gross profit margin. driven by scale improving cost curves and higher prices apples meaty gross profit margin is one of the companys greatest strengths. but will apples gross profit margin face pressure 00NUMBER00 gross profit margin history   before we look forward into 00NUMBER00 lets look back. analysis of apples recent gross profit margin trends provides insight into the underlying drivers for the metric and gives investors a better idea of its opportunities and threats. just a few years ago the narrative surrounding apples gross profit margin wasnt nearly as positive as it is today. after peaking in the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 at above 00NUMBER00 the introduction of an ipad mini and a completely redesigned iphone with the iphone 00NUMBER00 along with a high number of product launches across almost every category in a short period of time put pressure on margins. this lower priced ipad in the ipad mini paired with higher product costs sent the companys quarterly gross profit margin all the way down to 00NUMBER00 or about 00NUMBER00 points lower. at this point investors were concerned that the proliferation of cheaper android devices would erode apples pricing power and the market seemed to treat the companys falling gross profit margin as proof that this storyline was bound to play out. apples stock fell right along with its gross profit margin. aapl  data by ychartsbut it turned out that apples pricing power was stronger than the market thought. the companys gross profit margin bottomed out around 00NUMBER00 and prices for apples iphone which represented over half of apples revenue never came down. going further apple proceeded to introduce higher priced higher margin iphones   and customers paid up. in 00NUMBER00 when apple introduced the iphone 00NUMBER00 line not only did apple introduce a higher end iphone model in its iphone 00NUMBER00 with a starting price 00NUMBER00 higher than previous starting prices for new iphones but the company also introduced a higher storage tier. these new pricing tiers pushing the highest priced iphone all the way to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 higher than the highest priced iphones for previous launches. consumers jumped at the chance to buy high end iphone models proving worries about apples pricing power wrong. during apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which was the first full quarter of iphone 00NUMBER00 availability iphone unit sales rose 00NUMBER00 and iphone revenue soared 00NUMBER00. whats next for apples gross profit margin    now with about two years of positive year over year comparisons for apples gross profit margin can the company continue to improve its profit margin much longer more specifically will apples gross profit margin continue to improve in 00NUMBER00 year over year comparisons for its gross profit margin in 00NUMBER00 probably wont be as favorable as they were 00NUMBER00. indeed investors shouldnt be surprised if comparisons throughout the year level off. not only is the company up against stronger comparisons in 00NUMBER00 than it was in 00NUMBER00 but theres also been no increase in the price of the companys phones this year and slowing revenue growth means scale benefits wont come as easily. investors will get their first preview of apples 00NUMBER00 gross profit margin comparisons on tuesday when the company reports quarterly results. apple is guiding for a gross margin between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. in the year ago quarter apples gross profit margin was 00NUMBER00. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company

significant enhancements to the original ipad air. it was thinner lighter more powerful and even included the touch id fingerprint sensor that proved indispensable in 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00. alongside this new ipad came the ipad mini 00NUMBER00. the only real change that it brought from the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 was the inclusion of touch id and if you want to get really  nitpicky apple also added in an additional color option gold. this was a surprising and frankly lazy move on apples part. however it finally made good on the utter fail that was the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 with the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 giving the device an all new industrial design revamped internals processor wi fi etc. and an extremely high quality lcd with 00NUMBER00 srgb color gamut coverage ipad mini 00NUMBER00 only covered 00NUMBER00 of srgb. and it would seem that making a much better ipad has had a positive impact on sales of the companys latest mini ipad. quantifying this impact    according to a survey conducted by cirp via apple insider showing adoption rates of various ipad models in the united states ipad mini 00NUMBER00 adoption in dec. 00NUMBER00 was quite low with ipad mini 00NUMBER00 and ipad mini adoption each dramatically outstripping that of the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 which seems to have made up just over 00NUMBER00 of ipad sales at that time. however the dec. 00NUMBER00 numbers tell a very different story. ipad mini 00NUMBER00 is still the most popular ipad which makes sense given its price point but unlike with the mini 00NUMBER00 last year ipad mini 00NUMBER00 has seen quite strong adoption relative to the other ipad models making up from what i can tell eyeballing the chart  about 00NUMBER00 of overall ipad sales in the u. s. better products are better duh    apple has the financial might to invest in developing new ipad models each and every year. and even though its on the decline thanks to cannibalization by large phones ipad is still quite a significant revenue generator for the idevice maker. in order to even have a chance  of stabilizing ipad andor seeing it return to growth someday apple cant let its foot off the gas with respect to product development. i believe that the major high end mobile device vendors have largely decided to neglect the tablet market so apple doesnt face anywhere near the competitive pressures that it does in smartphones. however in order to compel current ipad owners to buy new ones and to convince owners of older non ipad tablets to ultimately refresh to ipad it will need to continue to bring meaningful innovations to all of its ipad lines mini through pro at roughly  an annual cadence give or take six months since this isnt the fast paced world of smartphones. these innovations dont need to be as sweeping as the ones that apple brings to its iphones iphone is much more important than ipad but the company really needs to avoid pulling the incredibly lame stunt that it tried with the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 again for the good of both its customers and its shareholders. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that

fabled electric apple  car may have just hit a bump in the road. the wall street journal  is reporting that steve zadesky who has been at apple for 00NUMBER00 and was most recently in charge of the electric car project dubbed project titan is calling it quits. zadesky had helped apple grow its automotive engineering team by threefold totaling approximately 00NUMBER00 employees as of last september according to the report. zadesky is reportedly leaving for primarily personal reasons unrelated to his performance and its unclear exactly when he will be leaving the mac maker. a speed bump at worst    this loss of talent is certainly a setback but it should prove to be minor in the grand scheme of things. elon musk has called the apple car an open secret since apple has hired over a thousand auto engineers to work on the project by musks estimation. apples auto team has grown significantly so theres no shortage of auto expertise and knowledge within the company and the iphone maker should have no problem backfilling the role either internally or externally. project titan is already a committed project internally which should give it priority when it comes to developmental resource allocation. interestingly daimler  ceo dieter zetsche recently visited silicon valley and met with about 00NUMBER00 different unnamed companies to discuss future trends. the executive suggested that apple and alphabet  s google are making better progress on their respective auto projects that he would have guessed according to reuters. why apple wants to expand its empire    as iphone growth plateaus the company continues to look beyond the smartphone market for its next big growth opportunity. the next immediately obvious opportunity is with apple watch and the burgeoning smartwatch market but apple is also looking into virtual reality autonomous electric cars deep learning and other promising areas. the main reason why apples valuation has been so cheap for so many years is because investors recognized that apple was approaching a limit to its near term growth. the law of large numbers is now taking hold as apples trailing 00NUMBER00 month revenue base is currently nearly 00NUMBER00 billion. if apple can successfully expand its empire into new markets and tap into new incremental growth opportunities it might be able to earn more respect from investors and enjoy some multiple expansion that could singlehandedly drive share gains even lacking meaningful revenue growth. thats especially true if you add in aggressive share repurchases that deliver significant earnings accretion along the way. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the

quarter results on jan. 00NUMBER00. analysts are focused on the companys iphone sales which have become so essential to its success that apple went so far recently to amend its risk disclosuresthe company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. unfortunately wall street analysts and others fear that time may have arrived. morgan stanley  analyst katy huberty believes the company 00NUMBER00 fewer iphone units in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 the year before. chip fabricator taiwan semiconductor manufacturing   announced that its first quarter revenue will fall 00NUMBER00 to the year ago period due to slowing demand for high end smartphones. and even usb  is jumping on the bandwagon despite its usual optimism toward iphone sales. while it expects apple to set records in its latest quarter based on data from consumer intelligence research partners usbs report shows that theres reason for concern. units versus revenue    apple sold 00NUMBER00 million units in the final three months of last year says ubs analyst steven milunovich. this is a slight increase over the 00NUMBER00 million units sold in the same quarter of 00NUMBER00. this is a much smaller increase than apple is accustomed to. the prior years figure for example represented a year on year increase of 00NUMBER00. ubs nevertheless expects apples revenue to fall by 00NUMBER00 on a year over year basis. what gives milunovich believes that 00NUMBER00 of iphone sales last quarter consisted of the newest and most expensive iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models. that figure was 00NUMBER00 in the same quarter in 00NUMBER00 pushing the average selling price up to 00NUMBER00. as a result of an older gen product mix presumably because fewer consumers were enamored with apples new 00NUMBER00 touch feature milunovich estimates the average selling price of iphone units to have decreased by 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. using milunovichs estimates and simple multiplication it projects apple to report 00NUMBER00 billion in iphone revenue versus 00NUMBER00 billion the company reported in the year ago quarter. simply put ubs believes the decrease in the average sales price will more than offset the small increase in units sold. while better than other analysts ubss estimates are nevertheless bearish for apple. with shares now trading at a pe ratio nearly half the greater sp 00NUMBER00 as a result of negative sentiment investors should be handsomely rewarded if the company is

one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at stock options channel is apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the october expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the october expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  while apple  ceo tim cook is likely to drop some fresh tidbits about the companys business during its earnings call on tuesday when apple releases its first fiscal quarter earnings release the ceo has already alluded to where he believes apple is headed. one of the key questions therefore ahead of apples conference call this week will be whether or not the ceo still feels the same about some crucial aspects of the companys business. apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. here are some important thoughts cook expressed in apples last quarterly conference call ahead of results. will the ceo remain as optimistic on these topics with the important holiday quarter now overiphone growth    iphone sales will continue to grow cook seemed to suggest in the companys fourth quarter earnings call. we believe that iphone will grow in 00NUMBER00 cook explained and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view. we recorded the highest rate on record for android switches last quarter at 00NUMBER00. he went on to list a number of other catalysts for iphone sales growth including expectations for more of its installed base of iphone users to upgrade to the latest model fast growing emerging markets where revenue is meaningful yet market share is low and the rising importance of its fast growing greater china segment. cook even suggested growth could persist beyond december. i do think that the sort of the macro things that i spoke about earlier the upgrade programs the android switcher rate the iphone momentum in the emerging markets and the lte penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter things. these are longer term things. with some analysts worrying iphone 00NUMBER00 demand may be weaker than apple expected will cook still be as optimistic about the potential for further growth in its iphone segment after it reports first quarter resultsapple watch   one area of focus for apple investors is the companys apple watch which was launched in the first half of 00NUMBER00. as its first new product in an entirely new category since the ipad investors are curious whether or not the new product segment could grow to rival its mac or ipad segments. heres what investors know about apple watch ahead of this weeks report. while apple doesnt provide specific sales figures for its apple watch the company did say sales of the device during 00NUMBER00 up sequentially and ahead of our expectations. the company also said during the earnings call that the 00NUMBER00 over year growth in its other products segment which represents about 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue was driven by apple watch sales. its likely that during apples first quarter earnings call management will provide further insight into the performance of these two important products as well as an update on expectations for their potential in the future. at a minimum investors can look over the financial statements to see if the numbers appear to line up with cooks comments from last quarter. the companys guidance for 00NUMBER00 can be used to decipher whether management may be expecting further growth in iphone sales since iphones represent about 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue overall guidance is usually indicative of managements expectations for iphones. furthermore investors can likely glean some insight about how the apple watch is performing by analyzing growth in other products revenue. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 the indian median income per household is set to increase by nearly 00NUMBER00 in real terms according to euromonitor international. indias middle class will reach a total 00NUMBER00 million people by 00NUMBER00 and its wealthiest citizens will outnumber the entire population of australia according to mckinsey. all of this will spur indias smartphone demand and next year the country is expected to overtake the u. s. as the worlds second largest smartphone market. forget the u. s. and china in other words india is where its at. the iphone maker is already in india   of course. apple sells its iphones through distribution network retailers but government regulations have kept apple from setting up its own retail stores or an online store. thats because laws prohibit foreign companies from selling devices directly to consumers unless 00NUMBER00 the devices are made from locally sourced materials. but that restriction is in the process of being changed. indian regulators started softening the locally sourced requirements in november and apple is seizing the moment. this week the company sent a request to indias department of industrial policy and promotion essentially asking for permission to open its own retail and online stores. but even if apple gets permission to open its own stores its no guarantee iphone sales in india will start rolling in immediately. india is huge opportunity eventually    its easy to view indias economic growth and massive population and start believing indian consumers will line in droves for the next iphone. india is still a country very much in transition and many consumers probably most cant afford apples devices. international data corporation idc says that in 00NUMBER00 will cost an average of 00NUMBER00 in india. thats just slightly  less than the iphone 00NUMBER00 currently apples cheapest device in the country which sells for 00NUMBER00. apples not ignorant of this price gap. the company has already slashed prices by up to 00NUMBER00 on some of its iphones and offers interest free loans in india. but establishing its own presence will be the real key to the companys growth in the county. apple doesnt even register as one of the top five vendors in india the market is dominated by samsung and micromax with 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 market share respectively. but apple is content to slowly build its position in the country. remember that the company slowly built its presence in china and it faced pricing issues in that country as well. the important thing for investors to remember is that apple wont be an overnight success in india. investors looking for the next iphone release or even the one after that to take india by storm may be disappointed. we dont yet know when or if apple will receive permission to open its own retail locations in the country. and even if it does itll then take time to build a strong presence there. its best to think of apples india strategy in terms of years rather than quarters. over the next decade india is expected to become an economic powerhouse. and when it does apple will be there with a shiny new iphone in hand. the next

primarily associate the multinational silicon valley based corporation with ipods macbook pros itunes and the companys founder steve jobs. some people believe mr. jobs to be a visionary who revolutionized the way individuals interact with technology while others do not quite understand the hype. what apple inc. is not always associated with is its multiple subsidiaries the number of companies it purchases and how the corporation is organized. this is due to the company being rather secretive with its finances. as of january 00NUMBER00 apple is publically known 00NUMBER00 companies. the actual total is potentially larger as apple does not reveal the majority of its acquisitions unless they are discovered by journals. the purchased companies for the most part are then integrated into existing projects. due to apples concealment of its business operations the following is a guide to what is known about how apple inc. is organized. 00NUMBER00. anobitimage via cultofmaccominformation about anobit is relatively small. anobit is a fabless semiconductor company based in israel that makes a key component that improves the performance of nand flash memory chips which are used in iphones ipads ipods and macbook airs. apple bought the company back in 00NUMBER00 an unconfirmed price it is speculated to be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 million. apple bought anobit for two reasons one anobits flash memory controllers are a key component of aforementioned apple products and two apple added a large team of chip engineers to its payroll. apple had at least 00NUMBER00 chip engineers and according to  techcrunch    roughly 00NUMBER00 of anobits 00NUMBER00 employees were engineers. 00NUMBER00. apple operations international et. alimage via qzcomaccording to a 00NUMBER00 report by a congressional panel per  the new york times    apple has avoided billions of dollars in taxes through the use of international subsidiaries. these subsidiaries are apple operations international aoi apple operations europe aoe and apple sales international asi. these subsidiaries are headquartered in ireland where the company has negotiated a special tax rate of 00NUMBER00. these subsidiaries contract manufacturers to assemble apple products sell the products to other subsidiaries for distribution and then return the profits back to the three main subsidiaries in the form of dividends. furthermore some of these other smaller subsidiaries do not have a stated tax residence and pay no taxes at all. here is the breakdown aoi is fully owned by apple inc. and is the holding company that receives the dividends from most of apples offshore affiliates. it has no physical presence and has never had any employees. aoe is a subsidiary of apple operations international and manufactured a line of specialty computers for sale in europe. finally asi is the company that contracts with third party manufacturers in china to make apple products. those products are then sold to apple distribution international. apple sales international paid little or no tax on 00NUMBER00 billion in profit made from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. apple storeimage via wikipedia. orgit is rather safe to claim that most individuals in the world are at least faintly aware of the existence of this aspect of apples business and therefore there is not too much information to detail. the apple store is the physical retail store that sells apple products. the stores sell macintosh computers software ipods ipads iphones apple watches apple tv and select third party accessories. if you have never been into an apple store bless your heart. depending on the time and day these stores can become very hectic and overwhelming. there are people everywhere either perusing the products to come to a decision of whether to purchase an item or not or simply hanging out to exploit the free internet access. purchasing an apple product can be rather expensive for individuals who simply use a computer for basic computing tasks like internet browsing email and word processing. the perusing is necessary. apple store revenues played an important role in the 00NUMBER00 fourth quarter earnings. apple reported quarterly revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion and quarterly net profit of 00NUMBER00 billion compared to revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion and net profit of 00NUMBER00 billion in the prior years quarter. the company contributes this 00NUMBER00 increase in revenues to records sales of the iphone apple watch and mac computers which are all available at the

a year over year basis for the first time ever this quarter apples fiscal 00NUMBER00. some bearish analysts even think that apple could report an iphone sales decline for 00NUMBER00 the holiday quarter when it releases its earnings results tomorrow. these worries have weighed heavily on  apple stock  lately. by contrast year over year sales declines for the ipad are old hat by now. apple reported its first ipad sales drop in july 00NUMBER00. it wasnt a token decline either unit sales 00NUMBER00 and ipad revenue plummeted 00NUMBER00 year over year that quarter. ipad sales returned to modest growth in the second half 00NUMBER00. however since then apple has reported year over year ipad sales declines for seven consecutive quarters. this trend probably continued in apples recently completed fiscal 00NUMBER00. estimating ipad sales    in the 00NUMBER00 holiday quarter 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple 00NUMBER00 million ipads with an average selling price just 00NUMBER00. that generated revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. unit sales were down 00NUMBER00 year over year while ipad revenue declined 00NUMBER00 year over year. the new ipad pro hasnt sold as fast as smaller models. image source apple. unit sales probably fell by double digits yet again last quarter. collectively the new ipads released this fall the ipad pro and ipad mini 00NUMBER00 have seen slower adoption than the ipads released a year earlier the ipad air 00NUMBER00 and ipad 00NUMBER00. based on fiksus usage data the ipad air 00NUMBER00 and ipad mini 00NUMBER00 accounted for 00NUMBER00 of all ipad usage by the end of december 00NUMBER00. this time around the ipad pro and ipad mini 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of total ipad usage  by the end of december. the usage data suggests that apple may have racked up about 00NUMBER00 million ipad pro sales and 00NUMBER00 million ipad mini 00NUMBER00 sales last quarter assuming a 00NUMBER00 million unit channel inventory increase. most people bought older ipad models last quarter in line with recent trends. a recent u. s. survey by consumer intelligence research partners found that the ipad pro accounted 00NUMBER00 of all ipad sales  during the quarter while the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 captured another 00NUMBER00 sales. models launched in 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 accounted for the other 00NUMBER00 of sales. the cirp survey used a fairly small sample size and only looked at the u. s. but based on that sales mix and the sales estimate for the new ipad models calculated above apple may have sold only 00NUMBER00 million ipads last quarter. even if cheaper models were more popular outside the u. s. which seems plausible it seems unlikely that apple sold more than 00NUMBER00 ipads. time for a new ipad air    in may 00NUMBER00 i wrote that ipad sales would probably return to growth by the fall. however that prediction began to look highly unrealistic after apple failed to release an updated ipad air for the holiday season. apple didnt update the ipad air line in 00NUMBER00. image source apple. despite the swell of interest for the ipad mini when it first arrived in late 00NUMBER00 the vast majority of ipads in use are 00NUMBER00 inch models. all four ipad mini models combined account for only 00NUMBER00 of ipad usage. furthermore the installed base of 00NUMBER00 inch ipads is much older than the ipad mini installed base. the first four ipad models i. e. everything before the ipad air together account for 00NUMBER00 of ipad usage. this likely indicates a user base of 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million people. most of these older ipads are ripe for replacement. however customers who have waited four years to replace their ipads probably werent enthused by the idea of buying a model that was already a year old the ipad air 00NUMBER00. apple may have left millions of ipad sales on the table last quarter by not having a new 00NUMBER00 inch model available. that said this replacement demand is just being deferred  not lost. apple could release the ipad air 00NUMBER00 as soon as the spring or it might wait until the fall. either way it is likely to benefit from significant pent up replacement demand when the newest 00NUMBER00 inch ipad goes on sale. that should drive the ipad lines long awaited return to growth. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its

and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  undoubtedly the biggest concern among investors going into apple  s earnings release on tuesday is whether of not the tech giants iphone sales will be able to continue upward. while apple ceo tim cook did imply  during the companys fourth quarter earnings call last year that he expects growth ahead for iphone sales some investors are worried that sales of its latest generation of iphones may not be as robust as the company was expecting. one of the catalysts apple was counting on in 00NUMBER00 to help drive more growth in iphone sales was further growth in its greater china as well as its other emerging markets. investors will get to check in on these catalysts for growth when the company reports results after market close on friday to see if these growth drivers are living up to expectations. reviewing apples growth markets    just how big of a growth driver are these markets for apple consider some of these tidbits on apples emerging marketsin 00NUMBER00 apples greater china revenue which now represents about 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue nearly doubled. apples emerging markets revenue which also includes china was up 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 and now represents 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. this continued the companys 00NUMBER00 year over year growth in emerging markets in 00NUMBER00. iphone sales in mainland china were up 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 to the year ago quarter. in apples third quarter earnings call the company said iphone sales in korea and india were up 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. when apple reports results on tuesday investors will get to see whether apples emerging markets are still serving up considerable growth for the company. while apple doesnt always provide specific data on emerging or even china specifically it does always break down revenue for geographic segments it calls greater china and rest of asia pacific each quarter. for a point of comparison going into 00NUMBER00 apples year over year revenue growth in greater china and rest of asia pacific in 00NUMBER00 were 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. investors shouldnt expect the same robust in these markets reported in fiscal 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00. decelerating growth rates will likely be evident in apples tuesday release as this is the first quarter the tech giant is up against the tough comparisons of it blockbuster iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. but considering apple did expect overall growth in iphone sales for the quarter these markets should at last post some growth  though it will probably be a notable deceleration from growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00. looking ahead   beyond checking in on the markets impact on apples results for the first fiscal quarter investors will be just as interested in whether or not management believes these key markets can help the company post more growth in iphone sales throughout the rest of the year. while apple doesnt usually break down guidance by product or geography the ceo may broadly discuss how he expects emerging markets to impact iphone sales throughout 00NUMBER00. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. of course apples overall revenue guidance for its 00NUMBER00 too could provide clues as to whether the company is expecting considerable growth from its emerging markets. investors can check in on apples growth in its emerging markets and on the companys guidance for 00NUMBER00 by visiting apples investor relations page after market close on tuesday where a download of the companys quarterly results will be made available. management will also probably share some useful insights about the performance of its different markets in its earnings call which is scheduled for 00NUMBER00 p. m. et. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds

views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple  reports fiscal first quarter results later today. but just before the company reports results and officially enters a season of tough comparisons lets take a look back at the companys extraordinary fiscal 00NUMBER00. while it may not have been a good year for the stock with shares declining 00NUMBER00 during the year it was definitely a good year for the tech giants underlying business. image source apple. here are 00NUMBER00 facts that help capture the companys huge 00NUMBER00. annual revenue increased by 00NUMBER00 billion. yes thats billion. during apples fourth quarter earnings call the company provided some colorful context to illustrate just how big this figure is our growth in one year was greater than the full year revenue of almost 00NUMBER00 of the companies in the 00NUMBER00. apples total revenue for the year was 00NUMBER00. thats more than three times alphabet  s and more than 00NUMBER00 times facebook  s. revenue growth in emerging markets 00NUMBER00. emerging markets played a key role in the companys growth 00NUMBER00 and represented a meaningful 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue. apple has a war chest of 00NUMBER00 billion. the company is locked and loaded with cash for more repurchases dividends investments and acquisitions. free cash flow for the year was nearly 00NUMBER00. this annual free cash flow is how apple gets away with an unprecedented share repurchase program a growing dividend and huge war chest of cash all at the same time. iphone sales jumped 00NUMBER00 between fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. in unit sales thats an increase from 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. apple generated 00NUMBER00 billion in net income and grew earnings per share by 00NUMBER00. apparently being the worlds most valuable company doesnt prevent apple from growing at high rates. apple spent 00NUMBER00 billion repurchasing its own shares during the year. this brings apples total spent on repurchases since it initiated its repurchase program in 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion. if apple did so well in 00NUMBER00 why is the stock suppressed at a price to earnings multiple of 00NUMBER00 ultimately because investors are worried the companys revenue and eps could be peaking. while theres some merit to these concerns as apple is even guiding for low single digit percentage year over year growth in revenue during 00NUMBER00 these concerns dont seem to appreciate the companys recent execution. apples extraordinary growth in 00NUMBER00 is obviously going to make comparisons in 00NUMBER00 very tough. following a year of 00NUMBER00 growth simply isnt easy. but just because the company may be positioned to post small or even flat revenue growth during 00NUMBER00 doesnt mean the stock deserves such a conservative valuation. the companys incredible growth in 00NUMBER00 should be appreciated as evidence of apples clout with both existing and new customers. further investors should expect apples revenue on a year to year basis to be volatile this is a natural byproduct of the companys focused portfolio of products. so its easy to see why apples sudden slowdown in growth could frighten the market. but its also easy to see why this fretting is based on a shortsighted timeframe. at the end of the day theres no clear indication that apple is up against any long term pervasive problems and the companys 00NUMBER00 demonstrates the strength of apples current business. with one last look at apples fiscal 00NUMBER00 its now time to turn to the tech giants fiscal 00NUMBER00. apple reports first quarter results after market close today. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  in case you missed it apple aapl will release earnings after the bell today. if there is such a thing as a regular reader of my ramblings here that person will be aware of two things firstly i am bullish on aapl anywhere around or below 00NUMBER00 and secondly i have a strategy or rather a focal point for trading into earnings. both of those things lead me to believe that from a trading perspective buying aapl before today’s release is a smart play on a riskreward basis. apple’s value at these levels is obviously more of a long term thing than a trading opportunity but it is still worth highlighting. what the market is adjusting to right now is the transition of apple from a pure growth stock to more of a value based security. back in 00NUMBER00 when i wrote that apple was overvalued as it approached a pre split 00NUMBER00 it was simply based on the view that expectations had got out of hand. after a series of massive beats of estimates analysts had begun to compete for the most outrageous forecast for apple’s earnings. despite that the forward pe of aapl remained at the kind of elevated levels normal for a growth stock. something had to give. right now we are at almost the exact opposite point. all the talk over the last couple of months has been that iphone sales will be disappointing and the apple analysts have been competing for the most sensationally depressing forecast for revenues and profits. despite that aapl still trades at a forward pe below 00NUMBER00 or around half of the average for the broader market. it is as if the market is still looking for growth stock performance from what is now a value story. if there was an expectation of a serious decline in revenue and profit then maybe that would make sense in some ways but that isn’t the case. instead similar to the worries about chinese growth what people are stressing out about is a slower rate of growth not an actual decline. in my book that is still growth but that tends to get lost in the sensationalism surrounding the conversation. the consensus estimates for this afternoon are for earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share on 00NUMBER00 billion of revenue as compared to 00NUMBER00 on 00NUMBER00 billion in the same quarter last year. okay you say but if iphone sales are collapsing then that growth is surely coming to an end. once again though it is a slower rate of growth not an actual contraction that has people worried. the iphone 00NUMBER00 has not caused the rush to upgrade that other iterations of the phone have in the past but in a quarter that was marked by restraint from consumers globally any increase in sales can be regarded as good. ultimately though what controls the immediate reaction of a stock to earnings data is the expectations of the market going in. on that basis buying aapl today makes sense. the negative tone of commentary and lower than usual expectations mean that even a moderate beat of expectations could easily produce an outsized reaction. a disappointment however will be just “as expected” which should limit the downside. this combination of long term value and short term positioning that favors a long position makes buying aapl into this afternoon’s earning a worthwhile trade. whether you use it as a short term position or just as an opportunity to buy cheap stock in one of the most successful companies ever is up to you but either way the potential outweighs the downside making it a viable trade. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  the apple  iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus were nothing short of epic  products for the idevice maker. apple enjoyed a surge in sales due to both pent up demand for large screen iphones as well as share gains against the various android vendors. however anybody who hasnt been living under a proverbial rock knows that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus are turning out to be in relative terms a colossal flop. according to generally reliable kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo apple will see slight  year over year growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million phones 00NUMBER00 million the year before but see iphone unit 00NUMBER00 year over year. that in my book is an unmitigated and inexcusable  disaster. although some want to blame it on a tough high end smartphone market im not convinced that this is the only  factor at play. heres one reason that i think iphone 00NUMBER00 may not have been the hit that apple was hoping for. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus get beaten by the older samsung galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge in displaycamera    apple has generally prided itself on having a best in class camera sub system as well as best in class displays. when the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus came out apple clearly led in both of these areas. interestingly toms hardware published a review of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and i was stunned to see the followingin terms of camera performance the iphone 00NUMBER00 were easily  outmatched by the samsung galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge in according to the reviewer every condition toms hardware tested. 00NUMBER00 plus doesnt do much better. the reviewer also said that there was no perceivable difference in image quality between the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the iphone 00NUMBER00 im stunned to see that apple apparently phoned it in like this with respect to the isight camera. furthermore if the iphone 00NUMBER00 fared poorly in the marketplace at this level of competitiveness on the camera side of things i can only imagine how much worse it gets when samsung rolls out the 00NUMBER00 or when the lg 00NUMBER00 rumored to feature the dual lens technology that apple is said to be experimenting with over the next month or so. in terms of display same deal. apple chose not to update the display in any meaningful fashion from the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus respectively and the toms hardware review shows the roughly one year old galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge beating out the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus where it countsmaximum display brightnesscontrast ratio samsung enjoys an oled edge herecolor accuracycolor temperaturecolor gamutagain this will only get worse for apple  once the galaxy 00NUMBER00 and other android flagships hit the market in the marchapril time frame. apple cant afford to do this again    im quite surprised that apple allowed itself to fall behind something like the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge in areas that fundamentally matter to the user experience. apple charges a significant premium for its products and buyers need to be assured that they are getting best in class quality in key areas like the camera and the display. of course one could argue that its the premium ios experience that brings customers in and keeps them coming back for more but i believe as the smartphone market matures particularly the high end of the market apple will need to offer best in class specifications across the board. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 i believe apple was penny wise and dollar foolish. they might have saved a couple of bucks on the phone bill of materials by choosing the displaycamera technology that they did but i think that without a clear advantage over the android vendors apple will find gaining additional high end share increasingly difficult. in my view the incremental revenue that it could capture from ensuring best in class componentstechnologies in its phones would probably more than offset the slightly lower product margins. heres hoping for the sake of its stockholders that apple picks it up with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and doesnt drop the ball with future iphone generations. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is

publication note digitimes  claims citing taiwan based supply chain sources that apple  will unveil its next generation ipad air in march. the companys suppliers are then expected to kick off mass production of the device during the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 that availability will happen a little while after the unveiling. lets take a closer look at everything we know about the device and what it should mean for investors. what do we know so far    apples attempts to double down on secrecy appear to be working. very little has leaked to the web about this device. we dont know what applications processor it will have what display enhancements apple intends to make or what other internal enhancements apple will bring. we do know thanks to a report from kgi securities ming chi kuo that it wont feature the 00NUMBER00 touch technology that made its debut on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. additionally per a sketchy purportedly leaked schematic of the exterior of the device the ipad air 00NUMBER00 may adopt the same four speaker setup found on the ipad pro launched in late 00NUMBER00. although the ipad pro wasnt for me   i did appreciate the noticeably better sound quality of the ipad pro compared to my ipad air 00NUMBER00. i think the inclusion of a much improved speakersound system would be a wonderful improvement. additionally that same schematic showed the inclusion of an led flash something previous ipads have not had making it better suited for photos than previous ipads have been potentially serving as an additional selling point or reason to upgrade. further i believe investors should expect either an 00NUMBER00 or an 00NUMBER00 applications processor in this next generation ipad i think the 00NUMBER00 would be the better choice but the 00NUMBER00 should be smaller and cheaper to make as well as a significantly higher quality display. apples ipad lineup in fiscal 00NUMBER00 should be quite strong    my fellow foolish colleague adam levine weinberg made the bold prediction that ipad sales would return to growth in the fall   something he now believes is unlikely to happen   in no small part thanks to the lack of a new ipad air in 00NUMBER00. once the ipad air 00NUMBER00 lands though apples ipad lineup should be extremely strong. at the top of the ipad air product stack should be the air 00NUMBER00 which should offer some very nice improvements over the air 00NUMBER00. the air 00NUMBER00 will probably receive a price cut and take the place of the current ipad air with the original ipad air getting phased out. apple also successfully remedied the competitiveproduct issues it had with the 00NUMBER00 ipad mini 00NUMBER00 with the quite excellent ipad mini 00NUMBER00 launched in the fall of 00NUMBER00. this product should do a good job of holding the line until at least fall 00NUMBER00 when i would expect a mild refresh to include an 00NUMBER00 the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 features an 00NUMBER00 chip. at any rate im not willing to make a call on whether the ipad product category will return to growth or not during fiscal year 00NUMBER00. however i do think the combination of the ipad pro ipad air 00NUMBER00 and a much better ipad mini 00NUMBER00 should put apple in as good of a position as it could hope to be in for fiscal 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are three stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry finally bites the dust. just like newspaper publishers telephone utilities stockbrokers record companies bookstores travel agencies

guidance for a 00NUMBER00 year over year decline in revenue for the companys current quarter has some investors concerned about apples growth potential. but as i said ahead of the report guidance for a year over year decline in apples second quarter revenue wouldnt concern me. here are 00NUMBER00 facts from apples most recent report that have me confident in the stock as a long term holding. 00NUMBER00. apples first fiscal quarter revenue net income and eps rose to 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 respectively in 00NUMBER00 a record for all three metrics. this represents year over year growth of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00. the companys outsized year over year growth in eps compared to net income was driven by its aggressive share repurchases between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. apple returned over 00NUMBER00 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends in 00NUMBER00. the companys gross profit margin for the quarter 00NUMBER00 up from 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. 00NUMBER00. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones during the quarter up slightly from 00NUMBER00 million units in the year ago quarter. 00NUMBER00. revenue for the companys services segment which includes sales from itunes apple music the app store licensing service parts icloud and apple pay increased 00NUMBER00 to the year ago quarter. this segment now represents about 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue up from 00NUMBER00 of revenue in the year ago quarter. 00NUMBER00. apple said the gross profit margin for its services segment mirrors its robust company average gross profit margin of 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00. revenue from apples other products segment which includes sales of the apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and other apple branded and third party accessories jumped 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter. this segment now represents 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue up from 00NUMBER00 of revenue in the year ago quarter. 00NUMBER00. apple saw a greater rate of switchers from android to iphone in 00NUMBER00 than ever before. 00NUMBER00. the companys balance sheet now boasts 00NUMBER00 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities or 00NUMBER00 per share. 00NUMBER00. apple now has an installed base of 00NUMBER00 billion active devices up 00NUMBER00 year over year. 00NUMBER00. the average selling price for apples iphone in the quarter was 00NUMBER00 up from 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. in constant currency this figure would have been 00NUMBER00. india revenue in 00NUMBER00 was up 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter or 00NUMBER00 in constant currency. 00NUMBER00. iphone unit sales for 00NUMBER00 in china and india were up 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 respectively year over year. with these 00NUMBER00 facts in mind a year over year decline in a single quarter is just a symptom of a company that generates over 00NUMBER00 of its revenue from a single product. dont forget in the year ago quarter apples iphone unit sales increased 00NUMBER00 and iphone sales soared 00NUMBER00. this very recent growth doesnt smell like a company in decline. for now expectations for a single quarter of declining revenue is only a single data point among the many reasons apple looks like an outstanding investment. if apples revenue declines over several iphone cycles then i might rethink my thesis. but for now ill remain an apple bull. oh and lets not forget that apple trades at less than 00NUMBER00 earnings. the article apple inc. s quarterly results

october to december. the company posted a record quarterly revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion and record quarterly net income of 00NUMBER00 billion or 00NUMBER00 per diluted share. the revenue showed 00NUMBER00 increase as compared to the year ago quarter 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 increase as compared to the previous quarter 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. the earnings per share eps rose by 00NUMBER00 year on year while the eps jumped up by 00NUMBER00 sequentially. luca maestri apple’s cfo as quoted in the press release said “our record sales and strong margins drove all time records for net income and eps in spite of a very difficult macroeconomic environment” she further said “we generated operating cash flow of 00NUMBER00 billion during the quarter and returned over 00NUMBER00 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends. we have now completed 00NUMBER00 billion of our 00NUMBER00 billion capital return program. ”key pointsapple posted healthy numbers but says that the revenue was dampened a bit by the unfavorable currency movement. admits of weakness across the markets and expects the sale of iphones to slow down during 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. apple is however confident that the sales would stabilize and eventually pick up during the latter part of the financial year. china contributed to 00NUMBER00 of the total quarterly revenue for apple. although the company sees short term ‘economic softness’ in china it remains confident of its long term potential. during the conference call tim cook apple’s ceo said beyond the short term volatility we remain very confident about the long term potential about the china market and the large opportunities ahead of us and we are maintaining our investment plans. ”apple crossed a major milestone of 00NUMBER00 billion active devices around the world. this would support the success of supporting services like apple music and apple pay going forward. revenue across geographiesout of the total revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion reported by apple during 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the major share in revenue was of america’s at 00NUMBER00 billion. the revenue for this region dropped 00NUMBER00 year on year but rose by 00NUMBER00 sequentially i. e. compared to the previous quarter. the revenue from greater china was reported at 00NUMBER00 billion up 00NUMBER00 year on year and a solid rise of 00NUMBER00 sequentially. europe was the third highest contributor to revenue slightly behind china at 00NUMBER00 billion moving up by 00NUMBER00 year on year but rising by a whopping 00NUMBER00 compared to the revenue in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. japan’s share in revenue was about 00NUMBER00 billion around the revenue earned from the rest of asia pacific which was at 00NUMBER00 billion. the revenue for rest of asia pacific increased 00NUMBER00 year on year but a massive 00NUMBER00 sequentially. revenue across productsthe iphone continues to be apple’s star product. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million units of iphone during 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 almost equivalent to the sales during the same quarter in the previous year but 00NUMBER00 higher than the sale in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. as a trend the 00NUMBER00 sales usually tend to be the best of the four quarters as they represent the holidays. the sales in 00NUMBER00 have been lower than 00NUMBER00 in the previous years and the same pattern is expected in fiscal 00NUMBER00 as well. iphone sales generated a revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion which is 00NUMBER00 of apple’s overall revenue. the sale of apple’s ipads was recorded at 00NUMBER00 million units weaker by 00NUMBER00 vis à vis 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 but up by 00NUMBER00 sequentially. the revenue from the sale of ipads was 00NUMBER00 billion. the numbers showed a drop in the sale of mac during 00NUMBER00 approximately 00NUMBER00 million units of macs were sold which generated a revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. the segment ‘services’ which includes revenue from internet services applecare apple pay licensing and other services reflected ‘sound growth’. the segment posted a revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion up by 00NUMBER00 year on year and 00NUMBER00 sequentially. the ‘other products’ segment contributed 00NUMBER00 billion to the overall revenue. the ‘other products’ segment includes sales of apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and apple branded and third party accessories. the revenue of this segment was up 00NUMBER00 year on year and 00NUMBER00 sequentially. tim cook apple’s ceo as quoted in the press release said “our team delivered apple’s biggest quarter ever thanks to the world’s most innovative products and all time record sales of iphone apple watch and apple tv. the growth of our services business accelerated during the quarter to produce record results and our installed base recently crossed a major milestone of one billion active devices. ”final wordduring 00NUMBER00 the shares of apple were down by 00NUMBER00 while during 00NUMBER00 the stock is trading lower by 00NUMBER00 year to date. the slowdown in china is likely to impact its numbers although apple is already working on ways to explore highly ‘untapped’ markets such as india to boost its sales and revenue. the company is rumored to have some interesting product launches during 00NUMBER00 some of those are a second generation apple watch a 00NUMBER00 inch iphone updated version of macbook air ipad air 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 and possibly an apple tv streaming service as well. apple is also working on its ‘secret’ project – titan to build an electric car. these new and updated product launches and existing services such as apple pay which are catching up should boost apple’s growth and revenue. the current stock market conditions and episodes of weakness in apple’s share prices present a good opportunity to ‘buy and hold’ the stock for an investor’s core portfolio. market capitalization and ytd returns as on january 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  tim cook delivered but just barely. over the past couple of months investors have been worried whether or not apple  would be able to grow iphone unit sales in the fourth quarter. in october   cook said iphones should grow in terms of both units and revenue. the company just confirmed that it did in fact post an increase albeit a modest one. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones during the busy holiday quarter approximately 00NUMBER00 more iphones than it sold a year ago. that translated into 00NUMBER00 in iphone revenue similarly a hair higher than 00NUMBER00 billion from a year prior. apple also sold 00NUMBER00 million ipads and 00NUMBER00 million macs. total revenue was a record 00NUMBER00 billion and gross margin 00NUMBER00. net income added up to 00NUMBER00 billion or 00NUMBER00 per share. what else did the mac maker have to saymacro and currency uncertainties    cook started off the call by acknowledging the unprecedented levels of macroeconomic volatility that global markets and economies are currently enduring. many countries are experiencing slowing growth particularly those that are driven by commodities due to falling commodity prices. thats leading to a wide range of currencies weakening especially against the u. s. dollar. he cited a handful of extreme figures for various currency declines. iphone average selling prices hit a new all time high 00NUMBER00. incredibly this figure would have been a mind 00NUMBER00 it werent for said pesky foreign exchange impacts. when were talking about 00NUMBER00 million iphones that all adds up to 00NUMBER00 billion hit for the iphone alone. china continues to be a strong market for apple and apple enjoyed the highest ever iphone sales in the middle kingdom. however cook did acknowledge that apple is just now starting to see signs of economic softness which it hasnt really experienced before. still greater china revenue jumped to a record 00NUMBER00 billion an increase of 00NUMBER00. on a constant currency basis revenue would have grown 00NUMBER00. speaking of constant currency results the foreign exchange environment has gotten so bad that apple is now introducing non gaap results for the first time in recent memory. in constant currency apples revenue would have been 00NUMBER00 billion greater. since fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 international revenue has taken a 00NUMBER00 hit based solely on exchange rate fluctuations after that revenue is converted to u. s. dollars. the pain is real and its not going away anytime soon. cash and capital returns    apple now has over 00NUMBER00 billion in total cash although 00NUMBER00 of this is located overseas. the company repurchased nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in stock during the quarter including its sixth accelerated share repurchase program. thats a fairly low level of repurchase activity which also explains why earnings accretion was similarly modest earnings per share rose 00NUMBER00 revenue rose 00NUMBER00. with its domestic cash position dwindling apple will continue to tap public debt markets to fund its share repurchase program. apple now has 00NUMBER00 billion in total long term debt plus another 00NUMBER00 billion in commercial paper outstanding. investors can continue to expect an annual update on its capital return program around april. watch and tv    apple watch and apple tv both enjoyed record quarters. that doesnt say a whole lot about apple watch since its only been on sale for three quarters and this is its first holiday quarter. and detailed information is obfuscated since both are bundled into apples other products segment which was up 00NUMBER00 over year. the company also took time to highlight services growth and pointed out that it has now hit a new milestone of 00NUMBER00 billion active devices. that installed base includes all iphones ipads macs ipod touches apple tvs and apple watches that have used apple services over the past three months. apple is trying to remind investors how much recurring revenue it can rely on both in terms of services as well as ongoing hardware upgrades. an iphone decline is coming    this was always bound to happen sooner or later. since it didnt happen sooner december quarter it will now happen later march quarter. guidance for the current quarter left a little to be desired but only because apple is facing an incredibly tough year over year comparison. last time around apple was so supply constrained on the

tougher. revenue should be 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. at the midpoint that would represent an 00NUMBER00 decline. apple has officially graduated into a value play. the next billion

anticipated earnings report for the quarter ended in december. the smartphone industry is clearly maturing and this is a major headwind in terms of revenue growth for apple. on the other hand the company is still producing rock solid earnings and cash flows. sales are running out of battery    apple reported 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during the first quarter of its fiscal 00NUMBER00 only a 00NUMBER00 increase from 00NUMBER00 in the same period last year. apple has traditionally stayed away from putting too much emphasis on macroeconomic factors when reporting earnings but ceo tim cook said in the conference call that global currency depreciation was a major drawback during the quarter and that sales measured in constant currency would have grown by a much stronger 00NUMBER00. investors and wall street analysts are increasingly concerned about the health of the chinese economy. while apple still delivered a 00NUMBER00 revenue increase in china cook admitted that the company is being hurt by slowing economic growth there. heres how sales performed in different markets and regions for apple in the quartersales in the americas region fell 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. revenue in europe increased 00NUMBER00 coming in at 00NUMBER00. sales in greater china jumped 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion. japan showed a 00NUMBER00 decline to 00NUMBER00 billion. the rest of asia pacific region delivered a 00NUMBER00 revenue increase reaching 00NUMBER00 billion. the iphone produced 00NUMBER00 of revenue during the quarter and a maturing smartphone industry is proving to be a considerable headwind for apple. the company sold 00NUMBER00 million devices during the quarter nearly flat year over year. ipad sales have been remarkably weak over the past several quarters and the latest earnings report was no exception. mac revenues are slightly declining but still outperforming the rest of the pc industry. apple is experiencing rapid growth in services and other products which includes apple tv apple watch ipod and beats products but these segments arent big enough to have much of a financial impact on the overall business level at this stage. sales in billions. units in millions. data source sec filings. for the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 meaning the quarter ending in march of this year apple is expecting revenue to be in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. this would represent a considerable decline versus 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during quarter ended in march 00NUMBER00 so management is confirming to investors that the company is facing declining revenues in the middle term because of maturation in the smartphone industry. if sales come in near management expectations the coming quarter will be the first time apple delivers declining revenues in more than a decade and this is arguably the main negative in the report. massive earnings and cash flows    apple is one of the most profitable corporations in the world and the company looks stronger than ever in this area. gross margin was 00NUMBER00 of revenue during the quarter a slight increase over 00NUMBER00 of sales in the year ago quarter. the business produced 00NUMBER00 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and capital expenditures absorbed only 00NUMBER00 of that money leaving apple with almost 00NUMBER00 billion in free cash flow. management allocated almost 00NUMBER00 billion to dividends and 00NUMBER00 billion to buybacks so total capital distributions approached 00NUMBER00 billion during the quarter. as of december apple had a gargantuan cash hoard of nearly 00NUMBER00. on the back of generous stock buybacks apple reduced the amount of diluted shares outstanding by nearly 00NUMBER00 versus the year ago quarter meaning that earnings per share are growing at a faster rate than overall earnings because of a reduced share count. earnings per share came in at 00NUMBER00 a 00NUMBER00 increase year over year and a new historical record for apple. investors were having a calm initial reaction to the report. shares of apple were falling by a modest 00NUMBER00 after the news hit the wires on tuesday probably because the slowdown in growth was widely anticipated   and  apple stock  is already priced accordingly. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its

headwinds that apple is facing right now. but despite the difficulties apple isnt swayed from investing in future growth. in fact cook says that investing during downturns has always proven to yield strong results farther down the line. apple isnt scared. rd expense is moving on up    apple has always been known for extremely efficient rd spending often comprising just a minuscule percentage of sales. while bears may equate lower spending to lower innovation i consider it higher efficiency. higher spending levels often translate into wasteful spending. in dollar terms apple spent just 00NUMBER00 billion research and development 00NUMBER00. but if you look at the companys rd spending as a percentage of revenue youll notice that its on the rise compared to historical levels. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. of course the real question is what  is apple spending all these development dollars on we do know that it has hired over 00NUMBER00 auto engineers for the rumored apple car although the head of project titan has now left the company  and apple reportedly implemented a hiring freeze within the division. design chief jony ive is supposedly unhappy with the teams progress. apple is certainly continuing to invest in apple watchs pipeline since the first generation model has a long way to go to become a truly compelling product category. meanwhile cook acknowledged on the call that the nascent field of virtual reality is really cool and has some interesting applications. the executive does not believe that vr will prove to simply be a niche suggesting that apple could be interested since the company typically only pursues mainstream market opportunities. oh apple also just hired a prominent vr researcher too by the way. apple is clearly searching for the next growth opportunity and you can see it in the rd figures. cook said apple continues to invest in rd without pause saying that there are great things in the pipeline. hey big capital spender    capital expenditures have skyrocketed in recent years as well and the mac makers capital spending isnt slowing down anytime soon. in the most recent 00NUMBER00 k annual report apple predicted that it would shell out a jaw 00NUMBER00 billion  in capital expenditures during fiscal 00NUMBER00 up from 00NUMBER00 fiscal 00NUMBER00. spaceship campuses arent cheap. image source apple. when asked about this capex forecast on the call cfo luca maestri reiterated that the plans are unchanged even in light of the difficult macroeconomic environment. first and foremost product tooling and manufacturing equipment always comes first in terms of priority. the company is also allocating a lot to expanding its data center infrastructure. with 00NUMBER00 billion apple devices now in use the company needs this infrastructure to deliver its various services. this year will also include a lot of spending for apples new spaceship campus which is proceeding on schedule. the next billion

iphone average selling prices further apple  should work to differentiate its plus line of iphones significantly relative to its non plus flagship iphone. the plus line of phones are more expensive than the non plus models at every storage tier so the more apple can convince customers to move to its larger phone the better. it would seem that apple will be doing just that with its next generation iphone except this time with a very interesting twist. two different iphone 00NUMBER00 plus variants    according to generally reliable kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo via 00NUMBER00 apple is actually planning two  variants of its next generation iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the first will come with a standard single lens isight camera and the second will feature a dual lens camera with support for optical zoom reportedly utilizing technology that apple got as part of its acquisition of linx imaging. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus with dual cameras would as suggested be a premium variant to the vanilla iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. i wouldnt be surprised if apple reserved the dual lenses for the configurations with 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb of on board flash storage with the smaller configuration models 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 as a means by which to convince customers to buy up the product stack. this is a credible time tested strategy    i always found it strange that apple didnt do much to differentiate its plus iphones from the regular models. sure it added little features like optical image stabilization and a sharper display albeit less color accurate and with worse contrast to the bigger model but they really were effectively two sizes of the same device. however it would seem that apple is finally taking the proverbial kid gloves off with respect to the larger iphone and will be endowing it with features that simply wouldnt work from a technicalfinancial perspective in the smaller phones. of course i would expect the vanilla 00NUMBER00 inch iphone to still be an excellent device for most smartphone buyers but its looking more and more that the really interesting innovations ones that hardcore smartphone enthusiasts should appreciate will come in the plus line. so long ipad    in its most recent earnings release apple reported that ipad unit sales plunged 00NUMBER00 year over year with revenue down 00NUMBER00. there is little doubt in my mind that the ipad is being cannibalized by larger iphones with the plus model likely doing the most damage. as apple continues to introduce innovative and interesting new technologies into its iphone lineup with the plus iphone models seemingly getting the best of the best i suspect that the value proposition of ipad will continue to erode. there will still of course be buyers interested in the large displays and the ipad specific software but iphone is clearly the better product and in my view it will only get better with time. that being said selling an iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in place of an ipad mini 00NUMBER00 air 00NUMBER00 is still a net win for apple assuming of course the customer wouldnt have bought both a new iphone and  an ipad otherwise as the iphone not only commands higher average selling prices but per unit margins are probably much better too. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to

time highs sales compared to the first quarter of 00NUMBER00 only grew 00NUMBER00. it should be noted that sales lagged behind investor expectations. it has been years since apples sales have grown so slowly over comparable quarters. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. for the longest time apple  bulls including myself have pointed to the companys incredibly cheap valuation levels as a potential opportunity for investors. the argument goes a little something like this apples earnings power cash flow and revenue growth have long surpassed the majority of the stocks in the sp 00NUMBER00 yet it has also long traded at a significant discount  to the market. for example right now apple trades at around 00NUMBER00 earnings while the broader market trades at a little over 00NUMBER00 times earnings. it looks even cheaper if you back out apples substantial cash position currently valued at 00NUMBER00 per share or 00NUMBER00 of its market cap. if you were to assign apple some type of market multiple based on its trailing 00NUMBER00 month earnings or forward earnings your pick then youd arrive at a meaningfully higher price target that would represent healthy upside. this is the approach that carl icahn has also used over the years  to calculate his valuation estimates. heres the thing it doesnt matter. a lesson from the shorts    theres an old saying when it comes to short selling. hear me out. theoretically there is no limit to how much a short seller can lose on a short position since there is no theoretical limit to how high a stock price can go. there have been plenty of times when a bearish investor will take a short position based on a justified short thesis only to still lose out. whywell the saying goes the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. famed economist john maynard keynes was the first to make note of that after he got burned on a highly leveraged currency trade. even if a short thesis does play out it can still take some time for the market to realize it and you have to be able to hold on to the position long enough to see it through to the end. think of david einhorns six year short on allied capital. but most of us arent hedge fund managers. how does this apply to apple    when it comes to owning shares of apple the market has shown a persistent willingness to assign the company a lower valuation than the rest of the market. a cheap valuation is only an investing opportunity to the extent that the valuation discrepancy or inefficiency eventually corrects  itself but apple has traded at a discount for years. there are a few possible explanations for why apple remains so cheap. part of it is that apple is an emotional stock that reacts heavily to fickle storylines about what may or may not be happening with the iphone business at any particular point in time. another is the law of large numbers since apple is clearly struggling to put up meaningful growth rates as its trailing 00NUMBER00 month revenue base has now swelled to 00NUMBER00 billion. frankly im not quite sure what it would take for apple to truly earn investor respect again. at this point investors shouldnt hope for the market to suddenly come to the realization that apple is too cheap. it would absolutely be a pleasant surprise but the market is clearly quite content to stay irrational as far as apples valuation is concerned. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

be an investing opportunity  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  following market close on jan. 00NUMBER00 its long awaited results for its fiscal first quarter and issued guidance for the companys fiscal second quarter. apple expects iphone shipments to fall year over year in the fiscal second quarter of the year marking the first ever year over year decline in iphone shipments in the history of iphone. although there was a lot of fodder for the bears in this report apple ceo tim cook and cfo luca maestri did offer some positives for investors to chew on as they await a rebound in the idevice makers key business. here are three of them. no. 00NUMBER00 iphone switcher rate hits record high    in an article published  prior to apples earnings announcement i was quite critical of some aspects of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus vis a vis the competition. however much to my surprise and i was happy to see this tim cook said that apple saw a greater number of switchers from android to iphone than ever in 00NUMBER00. although the competitive pressures should increase for the iphone during the first half of 00NUMBER00 as the competition rolls out more advanced phones i may have been a little harsh on the competitiveness of the iphone. that said i still believe that it is in apples best interests to make sure that from a hardware perspective iphone is best in class in order to accelerate switcher rates as well as offer more compelling reasons for people to upgrade. no. 00NUMBER00 apple wont take its foot off the gas even in tough times    during the call analyst shannon cross from cross research asked management to talk about apples plans for sga and rd spending in light of the pressures that the company is currently facing. cook made it clear that at least when it comes to research and development spending apple will continue to invest without pause. he pointed to the company having some great things in the pipeline and emphasized apples commitment to invest through downturns. in my view this is absolutely the right decision. economic downturns eventually pass and company that can emerge from those downturns with really exciting products to sell should be able to reap the benefits. those who let up on the investment levels weakening their product pipelines in the process may not be in such a good position once things get better. kudos to apple management for thinking foolishly i. e. for the long term rather than foolishly cutting expenses to bolster profits as revenue dips. no. 00NUMBER00 runway for upgrades    apple management had previously cited the fact that only 00NUMBER00 of apples installed base prior to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch had actually upgraded to those phones as a reason for optimism for continued iphone growth. on the most recent call cook provided an updated value for this particular metric. according to the apple chief only around 00NUMBER00 of the pre iphone 00NUMBER00 plus iphone installed base has upgraded to the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus. the implication of course is that a full 00NUMBER00 have yet  to upgrade. i suspect that this will work nicely in apples favor over the course of the next year or so especially once apple gets the iphone 00NUMBER00 an upgraded 00NUMBER00 inch iphone   out enticing those who want new iphones but not larger  iphones to upgrade. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion

yield is only around 00NUMBER00 but through a combination of share buybacks and raises it has the potential to become one of the most lucrative dividend investments around. current yield and stability    apple has fallen under 00NUMBER00 a share. as a result of the drop the company now sports a dividend yield over 00NUMBER00. this is one of the most stable dividends in the market backed by a net cash position of around 00NUMBER00 billion and tens of billions of dollars of annual earnings. aapl  data by ychartsapple may not offer the same rate of growth that it once did however it makes up for this with a combination of rock solid earnings dividends and share repurchases. this implies that its future returns will come with less risk than buying shares in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 or even 00NUMBER00 did. its now a perfect time with the share price close to 00NUMBER00 week lows  to consider picking up some apple. an increase around the corner    apple began paying a dividend in august 00NUMBER00 has paid it every quarter since and has raised it each may. it was bumped 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 followed by yearly increases of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. the company currently pays 00NUMBER00 per share on a quarterly basis. lets look at what your yield would be in may if you pick up shares now. at 00NUMBER00 per share apple currently yields 00NUMBER00. an 00NUMBER00 increase would lead to a 00NUMBER00 yield a 00NUMBER00 increase would yield 00NUMBER00 and a 00NUMBER00 bump would yield 00NUMBER00. the share price may have risen or fallen by the time may rolls around but that doesnt affect your yield on cost. image source pixabay. yield on cost    imagine that you buy 00NUMBER00 shares of a company that trades 00NUMBER00 per share and pays a 00NUMBER00 quarterly dividend or 00NUMBER00. it then appreciates 00NUMBER00 per year and raises its dividend payment 00NUMBER00 per year as well. after five years it would trade for 00NUMBER00 and the annual payout would be 00NUMBER00. someone looking at the stock then would see the same 00NUMBER00 yield that you saw when you bought shares five years earlier. for you the story is different. assuming you didnt reinvest your dividends into more shares which would further magnify returns you would receive a yearly payment of 00NUMBER00 your initial investment of 00NUMBER00. your yield on cost for this position is now 00NUMBER00 to go along with 00NUMBER00 of capital gains. if you continue to hold and the company raise its payout further this yield on cost will continue to increase. buying apple shares now and holding on for the next five to 00NUMBER00 years and ideally longer will allow you to experience this phenomenon for yourself. image source pixabay. apple is spending significantly more on share repurchases than dividends at the moment. this approach is great news for long term income investors for a few reasons. apple management believes that shares are undervalued and that buybacks are the best way to increase shareholder wealth. if shares are undervalued then a buyback benefits remaining shareholders. existing earnings are spread over a smaller base of shares which leads to higher earnings per share. apple should continue to focus on this approach while shares remain cheap. retiring shares has a direct benefit to income seeking investors. every share that apple retires is one less dividend payment that the company must make every quarter going forward. if there are 00NUMBER00 shares outstanding and the annual payout 00NUMBER00 then 00NUMBER00 leaves the company treasury each year for dividend payments. if 00NUMBER00 of outstanding shares are repurchased and retired then only 00NUMBER00 must be paid in dividends or the company can choose to allocate the saved 00NUMBER00 among the remaining 00NUMBER00 shares. now each share is entitled to 00NUMBER00 instead of 00NUMBER00. this benefit becomes even more pronounced as the dividend continues to grow and the company realizes years of savings. through 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 apple has bought back shares amounting 00NUMBER00 billion while paying out only 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends. at some point shares will no longer be cheap and management will begin to reverse these numbers. this situation may happen soon or may take many years but at some point shares will become fully valued there will be no more shares left to repurchase or the company will be taken private. its not crazy to envision a doubling or tripling of the payout simply from a management decision to focus on dividends over buybacks. apple cfo luca maestri. image source apple. buy now for a huge dividend return   a share today has a yield of around 00NUMBER00. in may the yield on the initial purchase should be somewhere between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. yearly raises in the range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 will continue to increase yield on cost while a lowered share count will make it easier and easier for apple to deliver substantial increases. its not hard to envision having a yield on cost of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 or more in 00NUMBER00 years. the existing product line should allow apple to deliver high single digit earnings growth while new products and services might bump that figure higher. this situation should lead to market beating returns over the long run. apple is poised to become one of the best  dividend stocks  for the next 00NUMBER00 years and i recommend taking a look at picking up some shares today. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  the record holiday quarter apple   reported on tuesday wasnt enough for investors to turn optimistic and its stock is down about 00NUMBER00 since. slow growth in iphone sales  and guidance for a year over year decline in revenue for its second quarter has investors concerned the company may be peaking. with apples underwhelming results and guidance in mind its probably worth investors time to take a closer look at the companys most recent update on its own performance. while investors can certainly learn quite a bit from the financial statements and press release for the quarter one area that is often overlooked is the earnings call. and apples earnings call for its first fiscal quarter was particularly interesting. apple store. image source apple. here are four key quotes from apples earnings call worth mulling over. android users are switching at higher rates    we were blown away by the level of android switchers that we had last quarter apple ceo tim cook said when he was describing why he still believes iphone sales can continue to grow over the long haul. it was the highest ever by far. this is obviously a good sign for the company as the iphone represents well over half of the tech giants revenue if the product loses its ability to attract customers from other platforms investors would have a great reason to be concerned. lte penetration is low in china   one particular data point apple management is excited about is the low lte penetration in china. in terms of china the lte penetration as of the end of last october which is the last data ive got was in the mid 00NUMBER00 cook explained. and so theres an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 00NUMBER00. a huge base of iphone users havent upgraded   cook believes one potential catalyst for further iphone growth is the larger number of users who have not upgraded to the latest iphone. the number of people who had an iphone prior to the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus announcements and so this was in september 00NUMBER00 that have not yet upgraded to a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus or 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 is now 00NUMBER00. so another way to think about that is 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 have not. this can be viewed from either a positive or a negative standpoint. while it does show that the addressable market for potential iphone upgrades is large it also suggests that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus simply may not be driving the upgrades the company hoped for. image source apple. expect an update on apples capital return program soon    as the company has done annually for the last several years cfo luca maestri said apple plans to provide an update on our capital return program when we report our second quarter results in april. so far apple has returned 00NUMBER00 billion of its 00NUMBER00 billion program to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. repurchases represent the lions share of this program accounting for 00NUMBER00 billion of the capital returned. last years update to the program was significant. the company increased its share repurchase authorization from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion. despite cooks reference to a few catalysts for further iphone growth during the call there are definitely still reasons to be concerned that apple could have trouble growing in the future. fortunately apples conservative valuation alleviates much of this pressure. but it will still be worth keeping an eye on these catalysts cook referred to during the call to see if they pan out as optimistically as management expects. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its

margin. apples path to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 management was guiding for a gross margin between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. instead apples gross margin for the quarter 00NUMBER00. this isnt the first time apples gross profit margin has exceeded 00NUMBER00. as i recounted in more detail recently   apples gross profit margin actually soared above 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. but a high cost curve on new products a large introduction of new products simultaneously and a falling average selling price for ipads put significant pressure on the companys gross profit margin dragging it down to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. since bottoming in 00NUMBER00 however apple has continued to prove to investors that its standard setting gross profit margin is sustainable. after flexing its pricing power with the iphone 00NUMBER00 lineup introducing high end iphone models that pushed the ceiling for the products prices the companys gross profit margin began rebounding. and now apple has posted a positive year over year comparison for its gross profit margin in every quarter since the second fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. data for chart retrieved from apples sec filings for quarters shown. chart source author. apples ability to achieve a gross profit margin in excess of 00NUMBER00 in its most recent quarter is more evidence of the companys pricing power. customers continue to be as willing as ever to pay a premium price for apples iphone. the average selling price for the device was a record 00NUMBER00 during the quarter. this is up from 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter 00NUMBER00 in the prior quarter. adjusting for currency headwinds apples average selling price was up a whopping 00NUMBER00. is 00NUMBER00 sustainable    it may be difficult for apple to sustain a gross profit margin of 00NUMBER00 or higher. indeed apple is already predicting the important metric will come down in 00NUMBER00. management guided for a gross profit margin between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 for the quarter  guidance that is notably below apples forecast for 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. but the longer apple proves to investors that it has pricing power at its disposal and that its products are in a premium market of their own the companys robust gross profit margin looks like one of the key reasons to hold this stock for the long haul. a profit margin so meaty means apple can continue to generate heaps of free cash flow and hopefully use this free cash flow on shareholder value building activities. sure the metric will likely be volatile as apples product cycles fluctuate and as the company introduces new product categories over time. but apples gross profit margin history suggests that investors can likely expect the metric to stay near 00NUMBER00 as the company benefits from its pricing power scale and loyal customer base. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street

no initiative on the companys part better exemplifies its sweeping visions for the future than project titan apples once secret automobile effort. but all is not necessarily well in cupertino these days. according to reports project titan appears to have hit its first major speed bump which could threaten apples ambitious timetable  for its next truly disruptive product. problems at project titan    according to a report from appleinsider citing sources familiar with the matter apple has placed its project titan team under a hiring freeze after members of apples executive team grew concerned over the projects direction and progress. the alarming decision stemmed from a progress review conducted by apple design chief sir jony ive upon returning from the holiday season in which the design guru reportedly expressed his displeasure with the teams lack of tangible progress. though not definitively related this move also probably coincides with the recent departure of steve zadesky the longtime apple veteran tasked to lead project titan whose resignation for personal reasons surfaced late last week. it doesnt take a genius to read between the lines. apple is reported to have expanded its staff for project titan to over 00NUMBER00 employees as it has attempted to bring project titan  to market by 00NUMBER00 an abnormally accelerated schedule for an industry where product cycles typically hover closer to seven years. and though the hiring freeze in and of itself isnt necessarily a negative news of issues at project titan should concern apple investors because of its long term necessity for the company. why project titan matters for apple stock   if the past five years of its stock market history contain a single lesson its that apple has suffered because of a lack of growth not profits. and though apple enjoys nearer term growth catalysts especially the coming iphone 00NUMBER00 refresh   the company has grown so large that it can only achieve meaningful growth  by disrupting massive markets such as the automotive industry. the global auto industry was expected to surpass 00NUMBER00 million total sales in 00NUMBER00 according to researcher ihs making it one of the few multitrillion dollar consumer markets that could still provide apple the opportunity to double sales without capturing the majority of its market share. contrast apples automobile market with the global watch market and the necessity for apple to place increasingly big bets to drive returns becomes evident. according to estimates from bloomberg the global watch industry produces sales of roughly 00NUMBER00 billion annually. true the industrys gross margins of nearly 00NUMBER00 make it a highly complimentary market for apples traditional high margin consumer electronics. however the entire industrys annual sales represent about one quarter of apples expected fy 00NUMBER00. apple needs to target massive markets to continue to meaningfully expand its financial footprint which is why apple investors will want to closely monitor the apparent struggles at what one could argue is apples most important strategic initiative today. the next billion

with empty pockets. photo flickr user dan moyle. stocks are by far the best class of assets to own if you hope to build wealth over a long period of time. and there is no magic formula to success simply buy a diverse mix of high quality companies and leave them alone. however there are several mistakes new investors as well as some with experience make that can be devastating to your wallet. mistake 00NUMBER00 day trading    people who are new to the market often plan to day trade their accounts and make big profits. day trading refers to the act of opening and closing stock positions within a trading day with the hopes of making quick profits from small intraday price movements. this is usually a bad idea as most day traders lose money even those with a solid strategy and good money management skills. one of the main reasons is that day trading is expensive. lets say that you make 00NUMBER00 round trip trades on the average day and there are 00NUMBER00 trading days in a year. this translates to a total of 00NUMBER00 trades or 00NUMBER00 individual buy or sell trades. assuming that your discount brokerage charges about 00NUMBER00 trade youll spend 00NUMBER00 on commissions alone each year. in other words you could be a good trader and make a six figure profit and still  potentially lose money. the odds are stacked against day traders leave trading to professionals and be an investor. mistake 00NUMBER00 speculating with options    options can certainly have a place in a long term investing strategy. for example selling call options against stock positions you own can provide some downside protection and also produce a nice income stream. there are other more complex strategies that can be good ideas too. however newer investors are often tempted to speculate on out of the money options in the hopes of making tons of money in a short time period. the problem is most of the time these trades dont pan out and the investor loses all of their money. for example as of this writing apple  stock is trading for approximately 00NUMBER00 per share. a quick look at apples option chain shows me that i can buy options to buy apple for 00NUMBER00 per share anytime between now and february 00NUMBER00 a premium of 00NUMBER00. this may sound like a great idea. after all if apple hits 00NUMBER00 anytime between now and then i can sell my options for at least 00NUMBER00 and earn more than 00NUMBER00 in a month. if something sounds too good to be true it probably is and thats certainly the case here. is there potential for massive profits with a trade like this sure. is it likely not at all. mistake 00NUMBER00 panic selling and greedy buying    did you know that over the past three decades the sp 00NUMBER00 produced total returns of about 00NUMBER00 per year on average but the average investors returns were a paltry 00NUMBER00 during that time periodthe reason is simple. we all know that the point of investing is to buy low and sell high but most investors do the exact opposite. when their stocks take a dive they panic and sell in fear of losing even more money if they hold on. and when stocks seem to go up and up forever thats when most investors are tempted to throw their money in buying near the top. the best course of action is to buy quality stocks without regard to what the market is doing and then hold on for the long haul even if your stocks go down. while admittedly this mistake wont make you lose all  of your money but i mention it here because its one of the most important lessons you can learn if you hope to be a successful long term investor. mistake 00NUMBER00 buying   penny stocks    i would think that after people see movies such as the wolf of wall street   they would never be talked into buying penny stocks. on the contrary the sad reality is that many people voluntarily seek these stocks out. sadly there are plenty of advertisements out there that promise things like 00NUMBER00 gains on our average penny stock pick. are there any penny stocks that have gone on to make average investors rich perhaps but rarely. the truth is that too many of these stocks many of which trade for as little as 00NUMBER00 share are pump and dump scams plain and simple. what happens is that a company will hire a pr firm to get the stock positive coverage in the media. it will pay analysts to write positive coverage and will pay media outlets to cite the analysts work. there was a particularly unfortunate case  a few years ago where a company known as goff which hadnt earned a dime ended up getting major media coverage and many unsuspecting investors took the bait and bought shares as high as 00NUMBER00. the stock fell sharply afterwards and now trades for just 00NUMBER00. instead of trying to get rich quick with penny stocks stick to solid companies when formulating your investment strategy or at least buy companies because you know and love their business. the best way to get rich in stocks is slowly    to sum it up just about anything you can do in the stock market that has a goal of big quick profits is most likely a bad idea. you can get rich in the market but do yourself a favor and do it the best possible way by aiming for a series of base hits instead of swinging for the fences. the 00NUMBER00 social security bonus most retirees completely overlook   if youre like most americans youre a few years or more behind on your retirement savings. but a handful of little known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. in

not be in store but there are two themes emerging right now. first is that the apple watch 00NUMBER00 not  see a full redesign yet. the mac maker might only add a few new bands or accessories to keep the lineup fresh but a brand new model isnt due out until the fall according to the latest intel 00NUMBER00. the second notion is that apple will go ahead and introduce an updated 00NUMBER00 inch ipad air 00NUMBER00 after the company chose not to update it last fall at its ipad event since the ipad pro was the feature presentation that time around. the refreshed model may get a redesigned speaker system and apple is reportedly testing support for apple pencil. what does that all say about apples product cyclesits worth the wait    if both of those rumors prove true then apple may be shifting to roughly 00NUMBER00 month product cycles for certain products. apple watch is a brand new product category so it has no legacy of annual updates but for the most part the flagship ipad has gotten some attention every year except for 00NUMBER00. this has some potentially important implications about how apple is approaching tablets and smartwatches. much digital ink has been spilled over the current state of the ipad business. last quarters figures just reinforce the view that people arent upgrading ipads all that often. ipad unit sales fell 00NUMBER00 quarter to 00NUMBER00 million continuing the downward trend that started a couple years ago. the ipad upgrades arent doing a whole lot to mitigate falling unit sales and its unlikely that the ipad pro will move the needle that much either. ipad pro targets the enterprise and creative professionals and is probably a relatively low volume model compared to the consumer oriented mini or air. despite the higher price point there was hardly an asp uplift last quarter up a modest 00NUMBER00 sequentially 00NUMBER00. in that case it makes sense to elongate the ipad cycle since in that way apple can probably save some developmental resources if it doesnt need to focus on shipping a new one each and every year. ipad product cycles have always been peculiar with regards to the timing and redesign cadence. its not like the iphones well known tick tock cycle. most of this also likely applies to apple watch which probably has an even lower upgrade priority  than the ipad. while new product categories generally improve performance dramatically  in the first few iterations apple shouldnt feel compelled to rush out a new model until its ready. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company

are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  dont say you werent warned. for months analysts have predicted that apple  s top line growth rate was destined to shrink. you cant blame the rational investor for paying the naysayers no attention though as it seems theres a cottage industry of analysts churning out bearish articles regarding apple daily. meanwhile the companys stock has provided an 00NUMBER00 boost over the past 00NUMBER00 versus the 00NUMBER00 return of the greater nasdaq. over that period apples become a vastly different company. for example in 00NUMBER00 the leading product was apples ipod 00NUMBER00 billion in sales and 00NUMBER00 billion in total revenue. for comparison in the recently completed first quarter alone apple reported 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue. introduced in 00NUMBER00 top product the iphone provided 00NUMBER00 of returns as the product continued to smash sales records. heres a breakdown of apples iphone revenue versus the rest of the companysource apples quarterly earnings statements. even apple understood that its reliance on iphone growth presented new risks to the company. last year the company updated its risk disclosure section to address the risk of reliance on a single product and its warning appeared to come to fruition this quarter with the company reporting anemic 00NUMBER00 on year growth. but what if i told you the quarter wasnt as bad as the naysayers saygeographical woes were exacerbated by currency headwinds but china is slowing    for the past year apples geographical growth has mostly been from china. for the past three quarters of fiscal 00NUMBER00 apples year on year growth rate in the country was approaching 00NUMBER00 a combination of easy comparables amid tremendous demand for the prior gen iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has led to enviable revenue growth rates. chinas torrid growth essentially obscured the fact that the rest of the company was growing at a much less torrid pace. heres a visual look at the divergence on growthsource apples quarterly statements. the last quarter wasnt as bad as it initially appears however. the dollar considerably strengthened during the period hurting apple upon currency conversion. in constant currency terms apple did grow non china revenue 00NUMBER00 a year on year basis beating last quarters currency affected 00NUMBER00. the currency headwinds even affected chinas results albeit to a lesser extent as the country heavily controls its currency shaving off 00NUMBER00 percentage points from apples performance. perhaps the iphone 00NUMBER00 is just not a compelling product    by all accounts the new iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are high quality smartphones but are they demand changing products apple generally releases iphones in a predictable two year cycle a number change generally consists of a form factor change and the last two the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 have resulted in larger phones while in the off year apple generally refreshes the internals and adds a user experience feature the iphone 00NUMBER00 added touch id. this year that feature was 00NUMBER00 touch a new pressure sensitive interface that introduced pop and peek gestures. while its an interesting feature it never seemed as if this was upgrade forcing technology. in addition there has been slow migration among third party app developers to use the feature on their apps. the quality of off year products is more important than in years past because every telco save att  dropped the standard two year contact by fiscal quarters end. instead of a dependable two year refresh cycle initiated by a new carrier contract the purchasing decision firmly rests with the customers desire. i think if apple brings a highly desirable iphone 00NUMBER00 to market this year top line growth in excess of the 00NUMBER00 the company achieved this quarter will follow. in the end i do think apples growth rate will slow but i think the combination of an off year model with an underwhelming user experience feature tough year on year comparables from china and foreign currency effects converged to make apples first quarter look much worse than it actually was. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at

2016-02-01 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.5803018771655146,0.2398683403535403,-0.0009051598207086,although the key information about a companys quarterly results can be gleaned from earnings press releases and the accompanying conference call with analysts the detailed quarterly and annual reports that publicly traded companies are required to file with the u. s. securities and exchange commission are usually filled with a lot of interesting information. apple  typically files its quarterly reports with the sec within a day or so of its earnings results so investors can get a good look under the covers in a quite timely fashion. in this column id like to go over three interesting tidbits from apples most recent quarterly filing. capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged    apple typically spends quite heavily on capital expenditures commonly referred to as capex. according to the 00NUMBER00 q filing the bulk of the companys capital expenditures go toward manufacturing equipment data centers and its retail stores. in apples sept. 00NUMBER00 form 00NUMBER00 k filing the company disclosed that it spent about 00NUMBER00 billion in capex in 00NUMBER00 and at the time expected to spend about 00NUMBER00 billion on such expenditures during its fiscal 00NUMBER00. in the just released 00NUMBER00 q filing apples capital expenditure forecast of 00NUMBER00 billion for fiscal 00NUMBER00 remained unchanged at 00NUMBER00 billion. this seems to suggest that even in light of the recent weakness in iphone sales apple isnt cutting back on its investments for tools and equipment to build future products. apples view of ipad    although management has expressed its long term bullishness on ipad the harsh reality is that this segment continued its rather steep decline in the companys most recent quarter with units down 00NUMBER00 and revenue down 00NUMBER00 both year over year figures. in the 00NUMBER00 q apple provided some additional context around the financial performance of ipad. the company attributed the decline in ipad to two major factors. first it blamed a longer repurchase cycle for ipads. apple also admitted in the filing that ipad is seeing some level of cannibalization from its other products i. e. iphone and probably to a lesser extent mac. as you might have noticed revenues declined at a slower pace than did unit shipments. this according to apple was thanks to a shift in mix to higher priced ipads including ipad pro. serving to partially offset the good news in mix was the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u. s. dollar. apples share repurchase activity now looking a bit. . . premature    in the filing apple provides information about how many shares it repurchased within specified quarters and what the company paid on average for those shares in a given quarter. you can see the data in the image belowsource apple form 00NUMBER00 q filing. although share repurchases are often viewed mainly as a mechanism by which a company can return cash to shareholders im not a fan of a company overpaying for shares. that is i want to see a company buy stock when its severely undervalued so that when the true value is realized the repurchases create significant value for stockholders. one could argue that even if a company pays too much for its own shares it can still create value by virtue of the fact that earnings per share for a given level of net income is inflated. theres also an argument to be made that a company lessens its total dividend burden with fewer shares outstanding. that being said id say that money would have been better off sitting in the bank so that it could be used at more opportune  times. at any rate it would appear that apple spent no less 00NUMBER00 billion in open market share repurchases at an average price of around 00NUMBER00 per share thats a full 00NUMBER00 premium to where the stock is currently tradingalthough hind sight is 00NUMBER00 it doesnt look as though it was a particularly good idea for apple to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of stock in the middle of a gargantuan iphone upgrade cycle that would have been very  difficult to beat in the following year. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry

herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  in the fall of 00NUMBER00 its very first very  large screen tablet the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. alongside that device apple delivered a quite substantial refresh to the ipad mini a device that the company had essentially neglected for an entire product cycle. what many found disappointing however is that the company didnt update the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad air. although there are various plausible explanations for why the company didnt do so the fact of the matter is that those who wanted to upgrade their ipads this holiday season didnt really get anything new to upgrade to. i hypothesized  earlier this month that apple may be planning a fairly substantial update with the ipad air 00NUMBER00 and it would seem that this will indeed be the case. 00NUMBER00 display coming soon    with the launch of the ipad 00NUMBER00 in early 00NUMBER00 apple introduced a very high resolution at the time display with 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00. since then apple has made improvements to 00NUMBER00 inch ipad display technology but it has kept the display resolution at 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 through several subsequent iterations ipad 00NUMBER00 ipad air ipad air 00NUMBER00. according to a recent report from digitimes   citing sources in the taiwan supply chain the next generation ipad air which is slated for a march 00NUMBER00 will come equipped with a 00NUMBER00 resolution panel. although the typical 00NUMBER00 resolutions dont quite fit the signature 00NUMBER00 aspect ratio of the ipad air i do think apple will pack enough pixels into the display to make it comparable in terms of overall pixel count to what is commonly known as 00NUMBER00 display i. e. roughly 00NUMBER00 million pixels. to drive this 00NUMBER00 display. . . more ram and potentially 00NUMBER00 claims that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will have up to 00NUMBER00 gigabytes in sic ram. this suggests that apple may include different levels of main memory in different models potentially based on storage tier. additionally in order to successfully drive a very high resolution display at good performance levels particularly in games and other graphically intensive scenarios i believe that apple will use the 00NUMBER00 chip found in the ipad pro rather than the 00NUMBER00 chip found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. it will be interesting to see if the 00NUMBER00 inside of the ipad air 00NUMBER00 assuming that apple indeed goes with that chip will run at the same speeds that it did in the ipad pro or if it will be run at lower frequencies for thermalbattery life reasons. an ipad air 00NUMBER00 thats looking as though its worth the wait    if apple delivers significantly better system performance with an updated processor as well as a much bettersharper display then id say that is a worthwhile improvement over the aging ipad air 00NUMBER00. however the key question is whether it will be enough to convince many of the members of the current ipad installed base  particularly those hanging on to older generation ipads  to finally upgrade. indeed data presented  by my fellow foolish colleague evan niu in a recent column showed that as of october 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of the ipad installed base is still using the early 00NUMBER00 ipad 00NUMBER00. a good 00NUMBER00 of the installed base is using either a third generation ipad or a fourth generation ipad and 00NUMBER00 are using the ipad air. 00NUMBER00 are still clinging on to their first generation ipadsits not clear what apple can do if anything in order to get those holdouts to upgrade but having new interesting and best in class products to sell can only help. sfrthe article apple inc. s ipad air 00NUMBER00 could be a massive

are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. while investors shouldnt expect apple  s massive new ipad pro to be the cure for slowing unit growth there are still some important ways that the larger tablet can strengthen the ipad business. its undeniably still early days for the ipad pro so it still has a long way to go before its impact can be fully felt. for instance you can hardly even tell if you look at last quarters results since the device wasnt available until november. even when ipad pro began shipping the apple pencil which is a large selling factor was severely supply constrained. people even took to stealing them from apple stores or scalping them online because they were so scarce. tight availability of apple pencil could have been a limiting factor to a small extent. ipad pro is just beginning    apple doesnt break out product mix in any of its categories but investors can get a sense of the mix by looking at average selling prices. if you look back the ipad minis release expectedly marked a significant downshift in ipad asps. the lower price point made the smaller tablet a lot more affordable and the product mix subsequently shifted toward these models although we dont know by how much. the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 originally launched in 00NUMBER00 remains on sale today as the most affordable ipad starting at 00NUMBER00. since the ipad pro starts  at 00NUMBER00 and maxes out at 00NUMBER00 youd think that there would be a notable increase in asps if ipad pros were comprising a meaningful portion of the mix. last quarter asps rose sequentially by just 00NUMBER00. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. that would suggest that ipad pro unit sales have

market researcher idc recently told business insider  that the ipad pro may eventually come to comprise anywhere 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of ipad unit sales. bi figures that would theoretically generate 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue based on last quarters total ipad revenue. but thats the wrong approach since the weighted asp includes ipad mini results. youd need to start with unit volumes. if ipad pro hypothetically accounted for 00NUMBER00 of last quarters 00NUMBER00 million units that would translate into at least 00NUMBER00 million ipad pros. if we apply a 00NUMBER00 asp for ipad pros then we get to around 00NUMBER00 in revenue. of course this is all just fun and games until ipad pro actually starts to ramp up. but eventually if ipad pro can climb to 00NUMBER00 of the product

signature product but that was up just 00NUMBER00 year over year. moreover sell through to end consumers was down by several million units offset by a buildup in channel inventory. iphone demand appears to be slowing. image source apple. to make matters worse ceo tim cook confirmed on the earnings call that apple expects iphone sales to decline on a year over year basis in the current quarter 00NUMBER00 of 00NUMBER00. this has led some investors to worry that iphone sales have peaked. its certainly true that iphone sales growth is slowing. however the fear that sales have already peaked stems from an unhealthy obsession with year over year growth figures. this focus on year over year changes ignores the obvious fact that the iphone has a two year product cycle. iphone sales follow a pattern    its common knowledge that apple has maintained an approximately two year product cycle for the iphone for many years. in even numbered years apple releases a model with a new number that incorporates major changes from older iphones. in odd numbered years apple makes more subtle upgrades or adds new non core functionality. for example in 00NUMBER00 apple introduced the siri personal assistant in 00NUMBER00 it added touch id and in 00NUMBER00 it rolled out 00NUMBER00 touch. to represent this more incremental change apple adds an s onto the previous models number. not surprisingly consumers tend to be more excited about the more innovative number change models. as a result iphone sales follow a clear trend. sales growth is routinely higher in the year following a number change. note that apple usually launches new iphones near the end of its fiscal year so number changes actually impact odd numbered fiscal years. two year comparisons are more revealing    given the iphones two year product cycle year over year figures compare apples no pun intended and oranges. one year benefits from a significantly upgraded model the other year has more modest upgrades to the flagship iphone. thats why it makes more sense to look at two year comparisons. comparing iphone sales in a particular year or quarter to sales in the year or quarter two years earlier reveals changes relative to the same point in the previous product cycle. the following table shows the year over year and two year comparisons for iphone sales for every fiscal year 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 as well as the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. fiscal yearlatest modelunit sales growth year over yearunit sales growth year over 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 apple annual reports apple 00NUMBER00 quarterly earnings reports. year over year sales figures show a slowdown in iphone growth since 00NUMBER00 but with substantial volatility. by contrast looking at the two year comparisons removes a lot of this volatility. the result is a steady downward trend with the exception of fiscal 00NUMBER00 when apples first ever phablet  the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus widened its addressable market. based on the two year comparisons apples first quarter performance looks quite strong. iphone sales rose 00NUMBER00 relative to 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00 the first full quarter of iphone 00NUMBER00. by the time the fiscal year wraps up iphone unit sales growth over fiscal 00NUMBER00 is more likely to be in the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. that still represents a double digit annualized growth rate though. still some growth left    if the recent trend holds apples growth on a year over two year basis will continue to slow in fiscal 00NUMBER00 perhaps even to single digits but it shouldnt turn negative. that implies a return to year over year growth which should allay concerns that the iphone has peaked. the iphones best growth days are behind it. however based on apples large and growing iphone user base it seems plausible that annual iphone unit sales could rise to 00NUMBER00 five years from now up from 00NUMBER00 million last year. thats more than enough growth to justify holding  apple stock  at its current rock bottom valuation of 00NUMBER00 times earnings. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech

one of the central tenets of cooks thesis is that the middle class population within china numbering just 00NUMBER00 million people in 00NUMBER00 will swell to about half a billion by 00NUMBER00 meaning that a lot  more people should be able to afford the companys premium devices. during the companys most recent quarter apple reported seeing year over year growth in china of just 00NUMBER00 a significant slowdown from the 00NUMBER00 growth rate seen in the prior quarter. even though 00NUMBER00 growth isnt anything for apple to be ashamed of cook did say that apple is seeing some tough macroeconomic headwinds in the region. in particular cook said the company began to see some signs of economic softness in greater china earlier in the month with weakness in hong kong being particularly notable. that said despite what cook describes as near term volatility he says apple remains very confident about the long term potential of the china market and that the company is maintaining its investment plans. lets take a closer look at how apple plans to continue to go after this market. continued retail build out    during the call cook said apple is continuing to invest in building out its retail store presence in the country. angela ahrendts senior vp of retail and online stores and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan cook said. we now have 00NUMBER00 stores in greater china and were on target to have 00NUMBER00 in the summertime of this year. although it remains to be seen what kind of impact growing the store count in china will have in the near term over the long term its obviously a good thing for there to be more places for chinese citizens to be able to explore and ultimately purchase apple products. tailoring products for the china market    one of the things thats widely believed to have helped apple in china significantly in the past fiscal year is the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. it had been well known for a while that chinese buyers tend to prefer larger smartphones and with the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus apple could finally serve these customers. its no surprise given apples immense bullishness on the china market that apple will continue to craft its products with an eye toward the wants and preferences of chinese buyers. obviously weve got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with china heavily in mind cook stated. we remain very bullish on china and dont subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions frankly. betting on an lte driven upgrade cycle    aside from the company specific actions that apple management expects to take to bolster its positioning in china cook also appears bullish on a broader transition from 00NUMBER00 to lte based devices. indeed he said lte penetration in china as of the end of october was in the mid 00NUMBER00 in terms of percentage. theres an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 00NUMBER00 handsets cook said. that said although apple should be able to capture a good chunk of those upgrades even low end handsets are transitioning to lte capable chipsets. the opportunity for apple is sizable but probably not as large as the overall lte penetration numbers would suggest as more affluent and higher end buyers have probably already migrated to lte capable premium devices. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion

about to undergo a major change. news may soon add the ability for publishers to sell subscriptions within the app and allow current content subscribers to login and and access their current content according to reuters. for example if you subscribe to the new york times   you may soon be able to view subscriber only content directly from the apple news app. and if you arent a subscriber you may soon be able to sign up to be one from within apple news. this isnt a particularly suspiring move if apple indeed goes down this path. the only way for apple to make money from the news app right now is through advertising and it can likely make a lot more through subscriptions. the move could also be a great thing for content publishers. around 00NUMBER00 publishers currently put their content in apple news but reuters notes that they dont have a lot of access to information about the 00NUMBER00 million people whove already used apple news. while the app comes preloaded on millions of iphone and ipads making it easy for ios users to have access to a publishers content not having information about those readers or a way to convert them into subscribers isnt a great model for publishers. extra extra revenue    of course content publishers already have their own apps but keep in mind that these content producers are constantly looking for new ways to attract more readers and subscribers. its far easier for a user to open an app that comes preloaded on their smartphone ahem apple news than it is to get a user to go to an app store and download a publishers app. apple also has the benefit of having 00NUMBER00 million apple id accounts tied to credit card numbers which could be used as an easy payment option to access paywall material within news. the barrier to convert readers into subscribers may be lower through apple news and publishers may be willing to give apple a cut of their subscriber fees to have it. this in turn could bring apple some additional revenue. how much is still unknown but i think this is a better approach to making money from content than newsstand was for apple. remember that app newsstand was the precursor to apple news where users kept their newspaper and magazine subscriptions. i think the difference with apple news is that apple and publishers will likely still keep a lot of articles open to users unlike newsstand. publishers could then have the option to allow a preset number of free articles before users have to pay. deadline unknown   its still unknown when or if apple will add a paywall system to apple news. but at this point it might be missing out if it doesnt. facebook  has already teamed up with publishers with its instant articles and there are plenty of other great apps on the market that bring publisherss content into mobile users hands for free. apple could set itself apart from the other apps by giving publishers a way to make money from their articles without requiring users to download a publisher specific app. content creators may not like the idea of handing over so much subscription control to apple but it may be a worthwhile trade off if a paywalled news app can easily convert users into subscribers. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

writerbetween the dire headlines and the near 00NUMBER00 plunge on the apple chart on wednesday it wouldn’t be tough to conclude that apple inc. aapl is toast … a once great company that simply ran out of willing buyers for its product. indeed for a perpetually optimistic apple ceo to utter the words “we’re seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we have experienced before just about everywhere we look” during the quarterly results conference call … well some investors are taking it as a cue to proverbially head for the hills. a funny thing happened on the way to inevitable doom for aapl shares and the company on wednesday though — the stock didn’t actually implode even though the bears could have done some real damage. could it be the worst case scenario was already priced inapple earningson the off chance you’re reading this and haven’t heard apple’s earnings last quarter were just so so and its guidance to the extent apple gives it wasn’t exactly thrilling either. in numerical terms for the quarter ending in december apple earned 00NUMBER00 per share on revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. the bottom line beat the expected profit of 00NUMBER00 per share of aapl but analysts were calling for a top line of 00NUMBER00 billion. total sales were up just a tad under 00NUMBER00 on a year over year basis from the year ago revenue figure of 00NUMBER00 billion and net income was up comparably. plus the 00NUMBER00 best healthcare stocks to buy nowit’s worth noting however that on a constant currency basis sales grew about 00NUMBER00. the dollar amounts are in many ways secondary measures of success or failure though. investors are just as interested if not more interested in unit sales for each of its popular devices and that’s where apple disappointed. last quarter apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones … a record but still short of the anticipated 00NUMBER00 million. the pros were looking for ipad sales of 00NUMBER00 million versus the 00NUMBER00 million units the company actually sold. the bright spot itunes software and services. ceo tim cook aims to cultivate that bright spot going forward though it’s still not yet apple’s bread and butter. with that as the backdrop investors’ pessimism today makes sense. on the other hand is the market really all that pessimistic on aapl the shape of apple chart — looking beyond wednesday’s action — says maybe not. apple chart finds a floorwednesday’s drop from aapl is admittedly ugly though stocks have survived worse. yet wednesday’s drop has yet to pull apple shares below that floor around 00NUMBER00 that came into play as of the middle of last week. wednesday’s low 00NUMBER00. it’s close to the tipping point but not quite there yet. coincidence maybe but not likely. as disappointing as the apple earnings report for last quarter was — and bear in mind what’s bad by apple standards would be wonderful for most other companies — the chart suggests this disappointing earnings reports was already factored in. aapl shares were down 00NUMBER00 from their june high as of the middle of last week before the pre earnings rally effort unfurled. but a chart’s history reflects a company’s history and a chart’s future is based on the company’s future … which the market can only guess at nope. that’s a naive view of how the market works. investors collectively price stocks anywhere from six months to two years in advance of future results. and as much as apple is watched it’s unlikely the company is capable of reporting anything truly surprising. in other words the market is plenty efficient … particularly with aapl. if the bears couldn’t convincingly crack the line in the sand established at 00NUMBER00 with disappointing news in hand odds are good it had already been fully factored into the stock’s price. indeed if anything wednesday’s action confirms the strength of that support area. the survey says. . . as of wednesday’s pullback the forward looking pe for apple is a mere 00NUMBER00. that valuation doesn’t yet factor in tim cook’s suggestion that the current quarter could be lackluster but even though it doesn’t apple is still dirt cheap given the caliber of the company and the creative problem solving skills its management team brings to the table. it’ll be fine in the long run. in fact it may already be at its ultimate cyclical bottom. it’s sounds a little counter intuitive at first but aapl may be buy worthy now if for no other reason than individual investors — as measured by social media — mostly don’t like it. taking the contrarian stance that the “average joe” investor off the street is most wrong when he’s most sure he’s right the recent tipping of the scales to a bearish view of apple in many ways implies the stock’s weakness has finally run its course. in complete contrast the so called “smart money” made up of institutional investors and analysts hasn’t been more bullish on apple in years … and the group is still raising expectations with the number of buy and strong buy recommendations still going up and the number of sell recommendations going down even as target prices are being reeled in a bit. bottom linethe disparity between the professionals’ opinions and the amateurs’ opinions hasn’t been this wide in over a year suggesting a sea change is in the making. that change is pointed in a bullish direction … and that idea is underscored by the recent apple chart and wednesday’s failure to actually move to a lower low. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. this

particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the june 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to happen meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00

shipments once again tanked to the tune 00NUMBER00 during the companys fiscal first quarter. apple claims that a combination of cannibalization by apples other products i. e. iphone as well as a longer repurchase cycle for ipads are driving these discouraging results. i believe apple is right on the money with these explanations but what it doesnt detail in the 00NUMBER00 q is that this longer repurchase cycle for ipads is very likely highly linked to the cannibalization by iphone thats going on. allow me to explain. thinking like a consumer    i consider myself a fairly typical apple customer i like well made high quality products that just work  and i dont mind paying a premium as long as i feel that im getting value  for the significant amount of cash that i hand over for my apple products. previously when iphones only came in small there was a very clear reason to want to have and extensively use an ipad. there are just some things that a bigger screen is better for such as video playback surfing the web and more. once the iphones got larger though the value proposition of the ipad was immediately affected. although something like the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus doesnt have as large of a display as an ipad mini or an ipad air its large enough so that doing some of the things that were frustrating on a 00NUMBER00 inch display are actually quite enjoyable. what does this ultimately mean for apple    i suspect that part of the reason that apple is seeing such a rich mix of iphones average selling prices hit a record 00NUMBER00 quarter even with significant currency headwinds   is that customers view their iphones as their one device to rule them all. if paying a little extra for say a plus iphone model with maybe a higher storage tier than what the customer would have done in a world with only small iphones means that she doesnt have to upgrade her ipad this year then apple sees a win in its iphone business and the customer saves money. now that customer may very well value having an ipad theres still a world of difference between a 00NUMBER00 inch device and a 00NUMBER00 inch one but since that ipad gets used for fewer things theres far less pressure for someone to buy a new one. another thing that doesnt help ipads case    there are ways in which the ipad of a given generation is superior to its iphone contemporaries. the highest end ipads get the fastermore powerful ax chips as opposed to the less powerful a chips inside the iphone. ipad also seems to get more system memory than current generation iphones. however in many ways iphone is the superior device. the displays on iphones tend to be sharper higher pixel density than the comparable ipads and the cameras are of substantially higher quality. the iphone also gets the new features first like touch id iphone 00NUMBER00 plus have a second gen touch id while ipad airpro only have the first gen 00NUMBER00 touch and so on. part of the reason for this can be attributed to the fact that iphone is simply a more important product to apple than the ipad is as evidenced by the revenue levels but its worth noting that iphone average selling prices tend to be much higher so apple has more headroom in the bill of materials to add top quality components. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are

2016-02-02 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.6043568284576135,0.2398683403535403,-0.0012062711784177,one of the major advantages of owning an ios device over say an android device is that apple  does a very good job of making sure that even relatively old devices get updated to the latest versions of ios right away. indeed apple will allow users to download and install the latest version of ios ios 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 as of writing on devices as old as the iphone 00NUMBER00 which launched in october 00NUMBER00. even the ipad 00NUMBER00 which came out in march 00NUMBER00 will run the latest version of ios. whats interesting then is that in light of the fact that apple is apparently having a very hard time   convincing owners of previous ipads to upgrade the company still seems to support these old devices for a long time. in this article id like to offer up my view on why apple supports its products for so long even though it may seemingly have a negative impact on revenues by virtue of lengthening product upgrade cycles. its all about building customer loyalty    i believe that the reason that apple does this is in order to build trust and loyalty among its customers. in my experience customers tend to appreciate devices that they perceive to be well built and long lasting. if somebody buys an iphone or an ipad and gets many years of quality usage out of the device that person may be more likely tochoose an apple product to replace his current apple product andpotentially buy up apples product stack when the time comes to replace the current apple product. the reasoning behind the first bullet point is fairly obvious good experience with a product from a given vendor is likely to lead to repeat business. the second point is a bit more interesting. a lesson that consumers often learn is that if you buy a relatively higher end high quality device that device will last longer than a lower end lower quality device. this means higher up front costs but the total cost of ownership on an annual basis may wind up being lower and the experience during the time of ownership should be better. additionally by making sure older devices support the latest version of ios apples devices have a longer useful life meaning that resale value tends to hold up better. this can potentially make it easier for current iphone buyers to finance newer generation devices with the proceeds from sales of prior generation devices. apple is playing the long game    although cutting support for prior generation products after a few iterations of ios might be a way to boost revenue and profits in the short term doing so would degrade the value of apple products in the eyes of many consumers in the long term. by supporting older devices for as long as it does apple is making sure that the premium devices that it sold several years ago manage to age quite well in a way thats arguably unmatched by its competitors. this isnt something that will go unnoticed by customers and ultimately serves to fulfill apples promise at the time of sale that it is selling users a good high quality product. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is

such as spotify and pandora   were founded with the sole mission of bringing great digital music experiences to the masses. on the other side resource rich technology titans apple  and alphabet   have both launched their own streaming offerings in hopes of strengthening their lock tight grip on our increasingly mobile lives. can the likes of spotify and pandora outmaneuver industry powers such as apple and alphabet a series of recent moves on spotify show exactly how david beats goliath. spotify innovates with video   this week swedish streaming radio player spotify added a video playback feature on its app for alphabets android with plans to add the functionality to its app on apples ios in the next week. this marks the first time any of the major music streaming services have integrated a broad swath of video from third party providers though alphabets youtube red subscription streaming service does allow users to watch music videos as well. according to the company the initial release will go live in the u. s. u. k. germany and sweden. a timeline for further expansion isnt immediately clear. spotifyin terms of types of content spotify signed partnerships with popular content providers including espn comedy central bbc vice media and maker studios. most videos will be snippets from popular programs rather than full length broadcasts. and while spotify management has said the service will remain primarily oriented toward music the company continues to keep ahead of the competition by out innovating them. innovate or die   since its 00NUMBER00 debut spotify has grown into what might be the most powerful name in streaming music by way of innovating and adding new features. video is only the latest example. spotifys deft maneuvering in the wake of apple musics launch late last june is a perfect case study. with an eight year head start in on demand streaming apple needed a way to brand apple music as different from and supposedly better than spotify. so apple focused on the one area where spotifys music platform left something to be desired curation. though spotify offered access to a massive catalog of songs discovering new music wasnt

tastemakers  most notably its beats 00NUMBER00 station. at the time this strategy seemed like a potential ace in the hole for apple. source spotifyhowever spotify responded with a series of products that countered and maybe even exceeded apple musics own curation chops. within the same month  as apple musics debut spotify released its discover weekly and fresh finds playlist tools both of which use spotifys user analysis technology to create custom playlists. discover weekly was a success and talk that apple might beat spotify through curation ceased. its this relentless ability to add cool useful features to its service that has allowed spotify to stay ahead of its larger richer rivals such as apple and alphabet. its also the lack of innovation that has so sorely hamstrung pandora

00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. sean oreilly  so diving in. were going to do apple first   dylan lewis  all right. lets do apple first. oreilly  sound good how did they do big numbers. lewis  big numbers. revenue came in at 00NUMBER00 billion within guidance but below analyst estimates. oreilly  dylan say it with a little bit of respect. seventy five im just kidding. its fine. lewis  earnings clocked in at 00NUMBER00 per share beating analyst expectations of 00NUMBER00 per share. obviously the third big number that most people are looking at when it comes to apples earnings are iphone sales. oreilly  its really the only number. lewis  yeah given that its two thirds of their revenue base. iphone sales were 00NUMBER00 units for the quarter which was up 00NUMBER00 units over the previous year. oreilly  thats not a lot. i mean. . . im not looking at a percentage but thats not a lot laughs. lewis  yeah. youre not used to seeing increases. . . oreilly  hundreds of thousands. what   lewis  increases of less than a million right and i think that was probably part of the problem really. i just mentioned its two thirds of their revenue base. 00NUMBER00 is an apartment complex in china. like. . . laughs   lewis  laughs yeah. oreilly  what is this   lewis  a city even. so despite guidance that theyd laid out in the previous quarter that had said there would be segment growth obviously investors were a little worried coming into the report. there have been some bearish signals from apple suppliers notably taiwan semiconductor   which is something we talked about before on the show little while back. so a lot of people worried about iphone growth and what general revenue growth would look like. those concerns are obviously somewhat valid. the company did demonstrate growth which you like to see. it was not up to the streets expectations which is why you see some of the dip youve seen in the market recently. oreilly  but dylan they beat on earnings per share estimates   lewis  yeah thats kind of perennially the apple problem. they lay out really solid guidance that at least shows some sort of growth except for this upcoming quarter which is something we can get into but the street always wants more. the article apple inc. s earnings lets talk numbers  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  in a recent article published in seeking alpha   contributor mark hibben offers  his perspective on how apple  ceo tim cook can turn apple around. in the article hibben suggests that apple should compete on price in a bid to gain further market segment share and grow its installed base. he justifies this by arguing and i find this truly shocking that apple doesnt need  to capture 00NUMBER00 of the industrys smartphone profits. heres why apple management should not heed this advice. competing on price is a fools errand. . . by competing on price apple immediately reduces its gross profit margin per device. although this might  lead to enough incremental unit sales to recover the lost per unit revenue and ultimately gross profit dollars this is by no means guaranteed. further if apple cuts prices there is nothing stopping apples competition from doing the exact same thing. in this case the smartphone market even the premium portion that has been so good to apple becomes a race to the bottom. in races to the bottom its tough for anybody to actually make any money. eventually the strongest players surviveconsolidate with the weaker vendors simply driven out of business but by this point consumers become so addicted to cheap  that even in a consolidated environment vendors find themselves unable to get customers to pay more. it can get ugly really really quickly. competing on value totally different story    although i believe that trying to compete on price is a poor long term strategy for apple especially when it is able to continue to gain share at record setting device average selling prices i am totally  for apple trying to compete on value. value usually comes in the form of new hardware technologies and software that can leverage that hardware to deliver fundamentally new and better experiences. think things like new versions of ios 00NUMBER00 touch touch id more advanced cameras more sophisticated processors and so on. at appropriate scale adding these features isnt going to add a whole lot to the bill of materials of the device especially if these features are software based. however such features especially implemented right from both a hardware and software perspective require very significant investment in research and development. as long as apple can suck up the majority of the industrys profits other vendors simply wont have the ability to invest in the research and development required to truly compete with apple over the long term. keep delivering value and customers will keep on upgrading    i believe that as long as apple is able to continue to deliver real innovations in future iphones then it should be able to both continue to gain share at the high end of the market although not nearly as quickly as it did with the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. and even if the high end of the smartphone market slows down significantly staying flat or growing at perhaps a low single digit clip from here on out thats not at all a bad business for apple.

herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  in 00NUMBER00 not one but two  flagship iphones the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the formers display measured a solid 00NUMBER00 inches while the latter brought a whopping 00NUMBER00 inch display. in the words of apple marketing chief phil schiller these phones were a lot bigger. generally speaking the smaller and the larger phones were pretty much scaled versions of each other with a few key differences. in favor of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus was the inclusion of optical image stabilization as well as a sharper full hd display. the iphone 00NUMBER00 had a display with better color accuracycontrast a slimmer body and a seemingly better screen to body ratio. with rumors swirling that apple plans to introduce not one   but two  variants of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus one with a single aperture camera and one with a multi aperture camera its clear that apple is doing its best to try to up sell users to larger more premium devices in a bid to further bolster iphone average selling prices. in my view in order for apple to really hit a home run with the next generation plus models its going to need to make sure it delivers the one thing that it didnt with either 00NUMBER00 plus or the 00NUMBER00 plus. no compromises please    it seems a bit odd that apple forces iphone buyers have to make painful trade offs between screen resolution and color accuracy and contrast. its also quite annoying that the larger inherently heftier phone is also thicker  than its smaller counterpart. if apple charged the same for both sizes of the device then it would be understandable that some sacrifices would need to be made with the larger device simply due to cost structuremargin concerns. however for the extra 00NUMBER00 that apple charges for its plus models over its standard models this seems like an unacceptable trade off. at any rate i believe that if apple is able to deliver an iphone 00NUMBER00 plus that is unequivocally better than the vanilla iphone 00NUMBER00 more users should buy up the iphone stack than they currently do proving to be a nice tailwind for iphone average selling prices. why are iphone average selling prices so important    it would obviously be very nice if apple could continue growing iphone units at a rapid clip but the reality is that unit shipment growth has slowed significantly. in fact apple itself expects iphone units to decline in the current quarter though it seems to blame this on macroeconomic headwinds more than on structural issues. in order for apple to stack the odds in its favor for iphone revenue growth even if unit shipment growth proves challenging the company will need to focus on shipping as rich a mix of iphones as possible. weve already seen rumors that apple is planning to introduce an entirely new storage tier with a 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone 00NUMBER00 plus model. this seems like a fairly easy way to boost average selling prices. that coupled with the reports that apple will introduce two variants of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus should mean that apple is setting itself up nicely to sell a rich mix of iphones in the coming cycle. i just hope that apple avoids some of the deficiencies that it stuck the prior generation plus phones with when it releases the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry finally bites

last week i pondered whether or not the tech giants interest in virtual reality could be bigger than the company was letting on. as it turns out this is probably the case. during the apples earnings call ceo tim cook officially stated the segment was not a niche. oculus rift headset. unlike apple facebook which owns oculus vr hasnt been shy about its bullishness on virtual reality. image source oculus vr. i think it can be its really cool and has some interesting applications he continued responding to a piper jaffray analysts probing about cooks high level thoughts on the theme. and this new information on apples endorsement of virtual reality was given more depth a few days after the earnings call when financial times  author tim bradshaw reported  the company had a secret research unit for virtual reality that is working on next generation headset technologies. heres the latest on the tech giants virtual reality efforts. apples virtual reality team may boast hundreds of staff    at least this is what ft  asserts citing people familiar with the initiative. as ive recently detailed   apple has acquired a number of key executives in the space including its most recent hire of doug bowman a computer science professor at virginia tech who oversees the universitys center for human computer interaction. this team of hundreds is made up of both poached employees and carefully targeted acquisitions according to ft. while not all of apples acquisitions are made public apple acquired primesense in 00NUMBER00 and according to ft   has now acquired flyby media a company focused on mobile augmented reality. apple already has prototype headsets   apple has been building prototypes of possible headset configurations for several months according to bradshaw. while facebook   alphabet   and microsoft   have all debuted at least prototype and beta virtual reality products apple has remained the sole megacap tech company to not publicly join in with a known physical prototype. but with the company apparently months into several prototypes according to ft   maybe apple has been just as active in the space as its peers. alphabets google cardboard. image source google. indeed it wouldnt be surprising if apple has been investigating the space closely and even been very active in creating prototypes. the company has always been known for its secrecy and cook has said emphasized that apple still values secrecy today. so a product may have indeed been in the works though shrouded in apple like secrecy. nothing is certain    apple is known for nixing product plans even at the last minute. so even if these rumors about apple taking virtual reality seriously are true its never certain that an apple virtual reality product will see the light of day. furthermore while apple may have hundreds working in the space this could represent a small investment for a company with several hundred billion dollars of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on its balance sheet. indeed one other background project the company is rumored to be working on an electric car reportedly has a team of well 00NUMBER00 working on this project. this dwarfs apples reported team in the virtual reality space. while investors can attempt to track rumors of apples virtual reality aspirations and potential products theres no reason to give such speculation any weight. rumors concerning apples future products have always been rampant and its only with the final market product can the company estimate market potential especially when it comes to a product in an entirely new category. and even estimating the potential of a known apple product hasnt proven to be easy. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot

00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. and now the company is expecting revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 to decline from the year ago period. this sudden shift in growth has investors wondering if the tech giant can return to growth. is a return to growth on this horizon its definitely possible thanks to one massive market with big potential greater china. first heres a review of how apples rapidly growing revenue transformed into expectations for a year over year decline in the current quarter. how apples revenue slowed   apples iphone unit sales leaped in fiscal 00NUMBER00 as the company benefited from high demand for its new form factor in the iphone 00NUMBER00 which sported two versions with much larger displays than its predecessors. and now apples new iphone 00NUMBER00 line which it began selling shortly before apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 began isnt living up to the blockbuster sales of its predecessor. as it turns out living up to a year of high growth when annual sales are well over 00NUMBER00 billion isnt easy  particularly following a year in which the iphone which accounts for over 00NUMBER00 of sales saw unit sales soar. hence apples paltry 00NUMBER00 year over year revenue growth in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 along with apples guidance for revenue to decline by 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 year over year in 00NUMBER00. but apples greater china market could eventually serve as an answer to the companys slowing revenue. heres how. the significance of apples greater china market    during apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 one market stood out as the tech giants fastest growing market by far greater china. and particularly intriguing about this market is that not only is it apples fastest growing market but its also now its second largest market. operating segmentrevenue growth yoy of total 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of asia 00NUMBER00 ceo tim cook shared a few more reasons to be optimistic about this market during the companys most recent earnings calliphone sales in greater china during 00NUMBER00 were higher than ever. app store sales in the market were also at a record high. iphone sales in mainland china were up 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter. mac sales in mainland china were up 00NUMBER00 year over year. almost half of iphones sold in mainland china during 00NUMBER00 to first time buyers. going forward cook cited low lte penetration and a growing middle class as potential catalysts for growth over the long haul. but it may take some time    notably however cook did seem to imply that greater china many not be a meaningful catalyst in the near term. notwithstanding these record results we began to see some signs of economic softness in greater china earlier this month most notably in hong kong cook explained. apple store in hong kong. image source apple. this economic softness in greater china is likely one of the reasons the company is guiding for a year over year revenue decline in 00NUMBER00. longer term however cook said apple is still confident in the long term potential for greater china to be a growth driver. as apple launches new products in greater china particularly its iphone 00NUMBER00 which should sport a new form factor apple looks positioned to benefit from growth catalysts in the important market. and considering how significant the market is becoming to apples results growth in the market could be a meaningful contributor to overall revenue growth over the long haul. investors should hope for the important market to help drive growth for the company as soon the fourth calendar quarter 00NUMBER00 which is apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. if the market isnt driving growth by then apple may be overestimating the markets potential. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool

rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  analyst gene munster with piper jaffray put out a note this morning via barrons expressing his skepticism that apple  will be releasing a new updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone at a march product launch event as reported by 00NUMBER00 mark gurman. munsters reasoning is that a 00NUMBER00 inch device launched in the spring would be quickly outdated when the redesigned iphone 00NUMBER00 out in six months. he also notes that launching such a device in the spring would shift the iphone news track to two events a year which could take away from releases of other products. i wholeheartedly disagree with munster the timing of this launch makes complete sense. heres why. apple needs to strengthen its low end product lineup asap    the theme of apples most recent earnings call was that macroeconomic and currency headwinds were significantly impacting the companys business. in particular in order to preserve its gross profit margins apple actually had to adjust read raise pricing in several markets. in order for apple to try to try to boost demand even in this tough currencymacro environment the company needs to find a way to go after lower price points while at the same time maintaining its margin structure. a device such as the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 would be a great way to do that. what the iphone 00NUMBER00 should enable    gurman reports that the iphone 00NUMBER00 in a 00NUMBER00 gb configuration should slot in at 00NUMBER00 with the 00NUMBER00 gb configuration presumably selling for 00NUMBER00. given that this phone is expected to be significantly upgraded from the prior generation iphone 00NUMBER00 and could even sport top of the line components like the 00NUMBER00 it should represent a significant boosting of the attractiveness of apples products at this price point. further im not entirely convinced that the current 00NUMBER00 will even be retired following the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00. i could see apple continuing to sell the iphone 00NUMBER00 in emerging markets at even lower prices for example 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 gb model and 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 gb model. at this point the iphone 00NUMBER00 is probably extremely cheap for apple to produce so such price points are probably possible without disturbing apples overall gross profit margin structure significantly. it is also still a very good device even to this day so if apple wants to profitably gain share in emerging markets where many potential buyers simply cant afford current apple products a further price reduced 00NUMBER00 would likely be a good way to do that. addressing munsters main points    munsters main points are that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be outdated once the iphone 00NUMBER00 rolls out and that a march iphone launch could divert attention from apples main launches. lets debunk both of those points now. starting with the first remember that apples flagship designs will likely continue to be the larger screen models from here on out. this iphone 00NUMBER00 is aimed at customers who want a modern 00NUMBER00 inch smartphone as well as customers who want the iosiphone experience with reasonably modern hardware but cant quite afford the flagships or even the mid range phones iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. if anything the fact that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are around the corner works really well  for apple customers with the money to spend on flagships will find it hard to choose the smaller iphone 00NUMBER00 by virtue of the fact that the 00NUMBER00 plus will be so far ahead of the 00NUMBER00 in terms of featuresperformance minimizing the cannibalization of higher endhigher asp models by the lower end model. the second point that the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch would take away from the main iphone events also doesnt appear to make sense. if anything as android vendors release their flagships in the spring apple would like to find a way short of releasing new iphones every six months to be on customers minds for as long as possible. a launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 in the middle of the not going all that well iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle is one way to do that. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable

sales make up two thirds of the companys revenue. in this clip sean oreilly and dylan lewis look at the numbers from the recent earnings call and discuss to what degree currency issues affected apples top line how the companys china strategy looks in light of recent concerns about that countrys economy and why investors shouldnt try to predict currency movements. a transcript follows the video. the

click here. this podcast was recorded on jan. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. sean oreilly  they already own america how are they doing internationally   dylan lewis  on a constant currency basis apple would have reported 00NUMBER00 over year growth which would have amounted to an extra 00NUMBER00 on the top line. oreilly  that would have been nice right so obviously currencies  didnt cook talk about that on the call like we dont know whats going on but the worlds crazy right now with these currencies. laughs   lewis  yeah he touched on it. he was like theres just a lot of crazy stuff going on that was basically the gist of it laughs. oreilly  did you see last night that japans going negative with their interest rates   lewis  yeah my roommate was talking about that   oreilly  theyre actually charging you to anyways. sorry to interrupt go on. lewis  no problem. so instead due to the strong dollar the company and investors had to settle for just a 00NUMBER00 bump. so you think thats 00NUMBER00 percentage points difference that they face due to headwinds. looking at china obviously one of the big markets for them in fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 they experienced year over year growth of 00NUMBER00 which is staggering. this quarter year over year growth of 00NUMBER00. that is a i mean its still growth. oreilly  yeah. its not white hot or on fire or anything like that. lewis  but its definitely a pump the brakes a little bit on that segment. similarly emerging markets 00NUMBER00 growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00 and this most recent quarter 00NUMBER00 growth. oreilly  everybodys worried about china hard landings all this stuff right now. cooks still bullish on them right hes optimistic   lewis  yeah. the general tone that you got from the conference call was were going to continue our rollout plans. i think they have the aim. . . i think theres something like 00NUMBER00 stores in china right now. . . oreilly  thats it   lewis. . . and theyre looking to get to something like 00NUMBER00 in the next year or two. none of this has affected those plans theyre still going to run through with that. but the foreign stuff is a legitimate concern. two thirds of apples revenue comes from outside the u. s. at this point. so the strong dollar while its fantastic for them buying components and things like that does make it tough to operate in some of these foreign markets. oreilly  long term though that is a pendulum thatll probably swing the other way eventually i would think. lewis  you have to think. were not really in the business of macro economics. . . oreilly  protocols and george soros y type stuff. lewis  and i think one of the things thats always preached is you cant predict which way currencies are going to move or whats going to happen on the more global scale but the companies that are operating well have great products and satisfied customers are going to continue to operate in that way. i think thats what were seeing here with apple. that said they have had to make some regional price adjustments. oreilly  up or down laughs   lewis  up to counter some of the currency issues and devaluations. so luca maestri the cfo i think some of his comments during the conference call had alluded to the fact that theyve made some moves but its possible there could be a ceiling at some point. theres a trade off when you raise prices that youre diminishing demand. so i think they know that inflection point is somewhere off in the distance. . . oreilly  because youre willing to pay 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 or whatever above a comparable samsung  for an iphone but once you start getting above that its like yeah. . . lewis  yeah the brand cache they have only offers so much pricing elasticity. oreilly  theyre not quite tiffany. someday. the

call. what was your best takeaway or tidbit for our listeners from the conference calldylan lewis  i really honed in on the gross margins. the reason i think this is such an awesome thing from the conference call is something i was talking about is you can look at financial statements and you can make numbers look very pretty in a table. without context or framing for why things are doing certain things its very easy to just say ok that was great and check it off. and so during the rundown running through all the numbers luca maestri highlighted the 00NUMBER00 margin for the quarter which is actually up from the previous quarters 00NUMBER00. thats not really. . . 00NUMBER00 laughs   lewis. . . its a 00NUMBER00 basis point bump but thats not really the whole story. in december samsung  paid apple 00NUMBER00 million to settle a long standing patent dispute between the two companies. oreilly  naughty naughty samsung. lewis  and this is actually something we also talked about maybe in late december or something on the podcast. so that baked into the topline number that that gross margin is based on. . . oreilly  so really it didnt grow. lewis  more of an operational metric and this is something maestri has talked about after being pressed on it from one of the analysts that covers apple that 00NUMBER00 million figure contributed something like a 00NUMBER00 basis point change in gross margins. so the more accurate gross margin number on a products side is closer to 00NUMBER00. and thats actually down both sequentially and year over year. so you know any time you see that 00NUMBER00 gross margin thats pretty gaudy right   oreilly  right. lewis  thats something apples going to play up. thats not a sustainable number here and i think when you look at what theyve

this is the struggle. theres not a lot of info on the apple watch. oreilly  so theyre being coy about it still. lewis  yeah and with the iphone line they give average selling price which is a metric people watch very carefully and they give units. so you can say ok this is what the revenue contribution is. its very easy. but they dont really do that aside from segment reportings so looking at like the services things like that. so all we really got on apple watch is as we expected we set a new quarterly record for apple watch sales with especially strong sales in the month of december. oreilly  it seems like the apple watch is. . . im far less bullish on the watch than i was or am currently on aws but it seems like apples aws. like theyre going to be coy about it until its big. lewis  that could be. i think thats got to be the strategy for tech firms. weve seen several companies do that at this point. the article apple inc. doesnt spill the beans on apple watch sales

views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  recent reports in the press suggest that apple  is planning to bring some fairly substantial camera improvements to its next generation iphones particularly the plus model which is rumored to use a multilens camera design. a number of readers of various apple related news sites have pointed out that apple traditionally saves its big camera improvements for its s iphone models suggesting that a big boost in camera capability wont come until the iphone 00NUMBER00. in this article ill explain why i dont expect this historical trend to continue. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus didnt bring significant camera improvements    many were disappointed by the fairly minimal improvements that apple brought to the table with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. apple included higher resolution sensors in these devices compared to the prior generation models but aside from that the consensus seems to be that image quality didnt actually improve much from the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. im not sure why apple decided to basically phone it in with the iphone 00NUMBER00 camera but apple would be shooting itself in the foot if it didnt bring a major leap in camera performancequality with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. indeed the competition is only getting more aggressive and apple needs to provide customers with as many reasons as possible to upgrade in the face of what is shaping up to be the first ever year over year slump in iphone sales. historical trends need not apply    as i wrote about in an earlier article   apple has significantly boosted its research and development spending over the last couple of years. although i suspect that some of this incremental spending is going toward non iphone related ventures apple is no doubt substantially increasing its investments in the iphone in a bid to try to getstay ahead of the competition. indeed in the early part of iphones life apple likely couldnt afford what its able to spend now meaning that it had to be somewhat slavish to a predictable set of improvements in the s and new number iphone launches. but with much greater ability to spend on technology development the patterns that held true in the past will probably not hold going forward. expect big camera leaps with both the 00NUMBER00. . . and the 00NUMBER00 am confident at this point that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will bring a substantial leap in camera quality from the iphone 00NUMBER00. there are still a number of ways in which apples cameras lag even flagship android devices today and i suspect that this delta will widen with the introduction of new android flagships in the coming months. however i suspect that apple is working diligently to close that gap if not outright take the lead with the iphone 00NUMBER00. i suspect that with the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple will once again deliver a big improvement in camera technology. there is still a very  long way to go before the iphone camera will be able to come anywhere close to modern dslrs in terms of image quality but the closer that apple can get the more attractive future iphones will be to buyers who value the quality of the images produced by their phones which id guess is a lot. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to

reflect those of nasdaq inc.  after much speculation in the press apple  confirmed with its revenue outlook for its first fiscal quarter that iphone sales would drop year over year during the companys fiscal first quarter the first ever in the history of iphone. apple ceo tim cook blamed this year over year decline on a couple of factors. firstly he observed that in the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple was significantly supply constrained on iphone 00NUMBER00 plus pushing out some demand to the second fiscal quarter. secondly he claimed that the macroeconomic environment had deteriorated meaningfully from a year ago impacting foreign exchange rates and ultimately demand. the first is kind of meaningless though as if that demand hadnt been pushed from fiscal 00NUMBER00 to fiscal 00NUMBER00 last year apple would have simply seen a year over year iphone decline in its most recent quarter. the second certainly makes sense though. at any rate even with these good shall we call them excuses   there is one thing thats quite troubling about this seemingly steep decline. apples strongest product lineup ever is failing to drive growth    when apple introduced the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus last year the companys product stack was essentially as followsiphone 00NUMBER00 plus at the high endiphone 00NUMBER00 in the mid rangeiphone 00NUMBER00 at the low endfollowing the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launches apples product stack looked as followsiphone 00NUMBER00 plus at the high endiphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the mid rangeiphone 00NUMBER00 at the low endwith this years lineup customers could get phones that were better in almost every way than their predecessors at the high end and the companys mid range offerings improved substantially as a result of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus slotting in there. even the companys low end device is quite a nice phone that still holds up in terms of performance and industrial design today about two and a half years following its launch. yet with such a strong product lineup across the price points that apple typically participates in the company is still looking at a fairly substantial decline in iphone units in the coming quarter. cook did try to offer some reassurance that apples fiscal second quarter would be the trough in terms of year over year declines but at this point i dont think anybody is expecting growth from iphone during this fiscal year. more innovation will help but can apple sustain it    i believe that had the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus been more compelling products vis a vis last years iphone 00NUMBER00 plus it may have been able to drive more robust upgrade activity to the latest model andor share gains though cook did mention record android switcher levels during the first fiscal quarter. the iphone 00NUMBER00 thats coming later this year should help especially if the rumors that apple will be doing a special dual lens variant of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are true big jumps in camera quality are always welcome. however from a longer term perspective one has to wonder whether apple can continue to deliver substantial enough innovations to ensure that the iphone stays on a growth path for the foreseeable future. there are some obvious areas of improvement that i see over the next couple of generations that i think will help but beyond that the picture seems to get a little bit fuzzy. of course thats part of the reason that apple is spending so much money on research and development. unfortunately apple cant allow the investment community to get a sneak peek at whats in the pipeline for very obvious reasons. in my mind investing in apple is a bet that the company can deliver sustained product innovations particularly in iphone in the years and decades to come. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry finally bites the

views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  source apple investor relations. just how bad things are at tech giant apple  is in many respects an exercise in relative thinking. despite posting the most profitable quarter ever  for any company apple saw its shares tank after its earnings report late last month amid renewed concerns over sluggish growth especially in its all important iphone segment. but apples report also contained a number of equally significant story lines especially concerning apples important other products segment which contains apple tv and the apple watch. as the dust settles from its disappointing earnings release what can we tell about how the apple watch performedapple watch and apple tv surge   only apples management team knows for sure just how well the apple watch performed during its fiscal 00NUMBER00. however evidence suggests that the apple watch enjoyed another record setting performance during the quarter. apple watch financial data is consolidated into apples smallest reporting segment other products which also includes the apple tv ipod and beats electronics hardware. for the quarter apples other segment enjoyed by far the most impressive growth of any of its reporting segments. 00NUMBER00 fy 00NUMBER00 revenuefy 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 revenuesequential changeyoy changeother 00NUMBER00 apple investor relations. revenue in millions. in all likelihood this impressive growth stemmed from sharp increases in apple watch and apple tv sales for a few reasons. though we dont necessarily have a great sense about beats growth profile we do know that the ipod remains in a cyclical decline thanks to the iphone. whats more ceo tim cook said the apple watch set a new quarterly record in its 00NUMBER00 holiday sales driving especially strong sales in december. all told apple watch distribution has now extended to 00NUMBER00 retail locations across 00NUMBER00 countries. at the same time cook also cited strength in newly launched fourth generation apple tv as meaningfully contributing to other products stellar performance. heres an estimate from one of the analysts i respect the most the notoriously data driven horace dediu of asymco   who tweetedmy estimate on watch sales is about 00NUMBER00 million units during 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 million to date. so while we cant say for sure all signs suggest that the apple watch indeed was a standout performer during apples recent report a fact that matters more than many apple investors may realize. a bridge to project titan   the apple watch will never drive the kind of revenue volume the iphone will. however with iphone sales growth largely driven by its multiyear product cycle and distribution growth non core product lines such as the apple watch should provide much needed organic growth for apple until its next massive revenue opportunity the automotive project titan   reaches the market near the turn of the decade. according to research firm idc apple watch should grow from its 00NUMBER00 estimates of 00NUMBER00 million units sold to an impressive 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00 roughly 00NUMBER00 average annual growth. assuming a simple average selling price of 00NUMBER00 would yield a hypothetical 00NUMBER00 billion in organic revenue growth for apple in the year when apple is reportedly planning to launch its project titan automotive project. sources apple investor relations   idc. especially given the anemic outlook for core apple products such as the iphone and especially the ipad apple watch growth could prove a useful tool in buoying its financial performance as more significant potential growth drivers prepare to come online. the opportunity for apple to capture a meaningful share of the global automotive market remains by far its best chance of creating a product with the financial clout to rival the iphone. so although apple watchs impressive performance in the companys most recent quarter pales in comparison with its larger divisions the device should remain an important source of much needed growth for the worlds largest and most profitable company in the years ahead. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street

mac sales even declined 00NUMBER00 all coming in below expectations. one business segment had a good quarter however growing revenue 00NUMBER00 year over year apples other products. other products is a catch all for anything that isnt a service itunes app store applecare apple pay or one of the three aforementioned computing devices. it includes sales of apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and apple branded and third party accessories. apple gave us few details about the success of any of those products individually but we can make some educated guesses about whats going on. new products for the holidays   apple sales typically rise in the fourth quarter following the introduction of its latest iphone model. indeed the iphone accounted for 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue last quarter. but the holiday season also drives sales of all of apples products even those released earlier in the year. this year the other products segment included two new products that it didnt have last year apple watch and apple tv. while apple tv isnt an entirely new product category it received its first refresh in almost three years and its price increased 00NUMBER00 for the base model. on apples first quarter earnings call ceo tim cook said we had our best quarter by far for apple tv sales. the apple watch was introduced last spring and it represents apples first new device category since the ipad was released in 00NUMBER00. even though it was released two quarters ago the holiday season led to a new quarterly record for apple watch sales according to cook. research firms juniper and idc both estimate that apple accounted for more than half of all smartwatch sales in 00NUMBER00 between 00NUMBER00 million and 00NUMBER00 million units shipped. apple analyst horace dediu  puts the number at 00NUMBER00 million with 00NUMBER00 million shipped in apples first quarter. even on the low end of estimates apple watch sales appear to have accounted for around 00NUMBER00 of revenue growth in the other products category offset by the continued decline in ipod sales. what can investors expect going forward   apples outlook for the second quarter came in well below analysts expectations. apple expects to suffer its first year over year sales decline since 00NUMBER00 this quarter with slowing iphone sales the biggest culprit. but the outlook for apple tv and apple watch should be strong. while apples efforts to put together a streaming tv service appear to have come to a standstill the fcc has proposed new rules that would allow third party set top boxes to access cable content. that could open up a huge market to apple tv. likewise the smartwatch market is expected to expand 00NUMBER00 million last year to 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00 according to idc. the research firm predicts that apple will maintain the majority of smartwatch shipments that year. even so those two devices wont completely make up for a significant slowdown in iphone ipad and mac shipments as they did last quarter. while the long term outlook for apple and its new devices is strong the company could face some short term pressure as it comes up against what its calling its toughest compare this quarter. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss

iphone makers philosophy when it comes to product introductions. apple cares very little about being first to market so long as when it finally makes its way there that it has the best product. that was the case with large smartphones. android oems capitalized on apples tardiness for a few years and apple drew some criticism 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus were massively  successful as the company finally moved to 00NUMBER00 inch 00NUMBER00 inch displays respectively. and theres more where that came from. not everybodys doing it    third party web analytics researcher mixpanel tracks the composition of iphone models out in the wild. the most recent data suggests that 00NUMBER00 of the installed base are still using 00NUMBER00 inch model like the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00. as some of these users upgrade to larger displays since thats the general trend that consumer preferences are taking then apple still has some untapped opportunities with its bigger models. dont just take mixpanels word for it either. on the past few conference calls ceo tim cook has given very specific data points as to what portion of the installed base has not  yet upgraded. the official figures are show even more upside compared to mixpanels. apple measures the number of users that had an iphone prior to september 00NUMBER00 when the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launched and this is how many that have not  upgraded and the related inverse. conference call 00NUMBER00 of install base that has upgraded to larger 00NUMBER00 of install base that has upgraded to larger 00NUMBER00 source earnings conference calls. the iphone install base continues to shift gradually toward the larger displays which not only boosts apples unit sales but also average selling prices since the larger models cost more and utilize that wonderful new storage pricing structure. 00NUMBER00 opportunities for the price of 00NUMBER00 investors know that 00NUMBER00 of iphone users have made the jump to larger displays. but its not as if everyone  wants a larger iphone. there is still considerable demand 00NUMBER00 inch iphones. on the last call cook added and we continue to offer the iphone 00NUMBER00 in the market and it continues to do quite well. and so we offer all of those and i dont see us deviating from that approach. this is also why it makes sense for apple to release an updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone since it will stimulate demand within the segment for smaller iphones although i tend to disagree with the rumored name  for the device. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  a little while ago i suggested  that apple  would be well served by more significantly differentiating its larger plus iphones from its mainstream iphones. much to my surprise and joy the rumor mill is abuzz with the idea that apple will reserve a significant new camera feature for the plus version of its next generation iphone and potentially even a higher end variant within the plus line. i believe that the differentiation on the camera and potentially a few other areas such as display sizeresolution as well as included ram is just the beginning of apples attempts to differentiate its larger phone from its smaller one. such differentiation makes a lot of sense because in a low unit growth environment a common strategy is to focus on driving upsell to products with higher average selling pricesmargins. should the rumors of what apple is planning to do with iphone 00NUMBER00 plus come to pass i would expect one more major differentiating factor to come to iphone sooner rather than later. chip differentiation    apple used the same 00NUMBER00 processor in both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 and yet again used the same 00NUMBER00 processor in both 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. kgi securities ming chi kuo believes that both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus will use the same 00NUMBER00 chip. however i believe that at some point apple will develop separate processor lines for each of its iphones especially if the smaller and larger iphones continue to diverge in terms of features and functionality. for one thing future larger iphones will almost certainly have higher display resolutions than the smaller iphones. this means more pixels to push necessitating a faster on chip graphics processor in order to deliver equivalent user experiences in 00NUMBER00 intensive applications such as games. to feed such a graphics processor apple may need to add a beefier memory subsystem in a chip targeted at a larger iphone. apple would also likely have additional headroom to scale up cpu performance. both of these moves would be straight out of the same playbook that apple uses to craft the ax chips aimed at the ipad. further if the larger iphones feature increasingly more capable imaging capabilities apple may need to include a more robust on chip image signal processor onto a chip targeted specifically at the plus models. if ipad gets custom chips why not iphone plus    apple spends a lot of effort putting together specialized chips aimed at the ipad. given that ipad sales are a mere fraction of iphone sales and given how much more important iphone is to apples bottom line than ipad could ever hope to be i dont think this is unreasonable to expect. such a move would add incremental chip development costs  a drop in the bucket for apple though and it would make managing chip productioninventory a little tougher but its likely to be totally manageable. apple has a good idea at this point of what ratio of plus to non plus iphones it sells  something it didnt really know when it first launched the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. when might we see apple introduce such differentiation    i dont expect apple to do this chip level differentiation of the iphone and the iphone plus models until at the very least the iphone 00NUMBER00. however it wouldnt surprise me if iphone customers will have to wait until the iphone 00NUMBER00 or beyond before the company differentiates the phones in this manner. however im fairly convinced that its only a matter of time before it happens. apple surely wants to sell customers up to the plus models as much as possible and the promise of more performance to go with all of the other added goodies can only help in the quest to do so. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies

it   apple rumors are about as credible as they get. his track record with information on events and products ahead of their release is solid. apple store. image source apple. what exactly is gurman expecting at the event two new products an ipad air 00NUMBER00 and a smaller iphone. heres what there is to know about the two products along with a bit of context about why they may matter to investors. ipad air 00NUMBER00 will give its 00NUMBER00 inch tablet line its first significant upgrade since the ipad air 00NUMBER00 launch in october 00NUMBER00 gurman predicts. he says the updated tablet will take some cues from the ipad pro including enhanced speakers and a smart connector or apples new interface that connects a keyboard to the ipad. the company may be hoping the fresh update to its ipad line could moderate declining sales in the category. apples ipad business which accounted for about 00NUMBER00 of total revenue in its most recent quarter has been declining on a year over year basis for nearly two years. in apples most recently reported quarter ipad unit sales were down 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter and ipad revenue was down 00NUMBER00 during the same period. by beefing up its tablets with better speakers and smart connectors that enable them to connect to keyboards apple is increasingly blurring the lines between macs and ipads. while the two products are still distinctly from each other theyre becoming similar enough for a small yet growing group of users who may opt to replace their notebooks with tablets. the most recent update for the ipad air may

an iphone would be out of the norm for the company. apple has historically spaced out its iphone launches by a year introducing them every fall. but the unusual timing makes sense. with apple now

since rumors began to spread that apple  was planning a big product launch event  in march it seemed likely that an updated 00NUMBER00 inch ipad would be one of the new products being announced. apple hasnt updated the ipad air line since 00NUMBER00. photo apple. in the past couple of weeks more details have emerged about apples plans. it does appear that a new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad  presumably called the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will be unveiled next month. this event could catalyze a rapid return to sales growth for the ipad product line. details of apples march event roll in    earlier this week mark gurman of 00NUMBER00 reported that apple has tentatively set march 00NUMBER00 the date for its upcoming product launch event. apple is expected to launch several new bands and improved software for the apple watch an updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone called the 00NUMBER00 and the ipad air 00NUMBER00. the new ipad is likely to bring apples 00NUMBER00 inch tablet up to the standard the ipad pro set last fall. in addition to the usual hardware updates like a faster processor this could potentially entail making keyboard and stylus accessories compatible with the ipad air 00NUMBER00. apple may also include an led flash for the rear camera to enable better low light photography according to gurman. theres nothing revolutionary about these updates. however together they represent a solid step forward from the aging ipad air 00NUMBER00 and they add capabilities that could draw in new customers and persuade people using older models to upgrade. why the ipad launch is important    just a few years ago the ipad was one of apples key growth drivers. yet for the past two years ipad sales declines have become the norm representing a huge drag on apples growth. last quarter apple sold 00NUMBER00 million ipads down from 00NUMBER00 two years earlier this drop translates to nearly 00NUMBER00 of lost revenue over the past two years just for apples first fiscal quarter. as a result the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is arguably the most important piece of apples spring product launch plans. getting ipad sales growing again would have a meaningful impact on apples overall revenue growth. there is a decent chance that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will catalyze a significant ipad replacement cycle. the first four ipad generations together continue to represent 00NUMBER00 of all ipad usage implying a user base of up to 00NUMBER00 million people. most of these devices are three to five years old making them ripe for replacement assuming that the ipad will follow a laptop like replacement cycle. older ipads still represent a high proportion of the installed base. photo apple. to look at things a different way the last time apple released a new ipad in march was 00NUMBER00. in the following quarter apple sold 00NUMBER00 million ipads bringing in 00NUMBER00 of revenue. by contrast in the same quarter last year apple sold 00NUMBER00 million ipads generating revenue of 00NUMBER00. its unlikely that apple will recover all of that lost ipad sales volume in one fell swoop. still having the first 00NUMBER00 inch ipad since 00NUMBER00 available this spring should drive a return to growth for the ipad product line in the third fiscal quarter. cannibalization or slow upgrade cycle    in its recent quarterly sec filing apple aptly summed up the two key theories for why ipad sales have been declining lately the company believes the decline in ipad sales is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for ipads and some level of cannibalization from the companys other productsthese two explanations have vastly different implications for apples future ipad sales trajectory. if the problem is cannibalization from large screen phones such as the iphone 00NUMBER00 and thinner laptops such as the new macbook then ipad demand may never bounce back to the highs of a few years ago. on the other hand if the problem is a long replacement cycle it implies that a strong wave of upgrade demand is coming eventually. the launch of the ipad air 00NUMBER00 this spring could be the catalyst for unleashing some of that demand. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest

tune of 00NUMBER00 in units and 00NUMBER00 revenues on a year over year basis. this acceleration in the decline of the ipad from the prior quarter units and revenue were both down 00NUMBER00 year over year came even as apple introduced the ipad pro and introduced a significantly revamped ipad mini. although the ipad air 00NUMBER00 which is rumored to be coming in march could help to provide a boost to overall ipad sales especially if apple reduces the prices on the current generation ipad air 00NUMBER00 new product launches in the ipad category havent seemed to be of much help lately. however despite what seems like an utterly dire situation for ipad no doubt thanks significantly to the continued proliferation of larger screen iphones   it would seem that apple ceo tim cook believes that the product category will return to growth by the end of 00NUMBER00. heres what tim cook reportedly said    according to 00NUMBER00 mark gurman citing multiple sources in attendance of a town hall meeting at apples headquarters cook was apparently especially bullish on ipad as a product category. hes seemingly so  bullish that he reportedly told apple employees that he expects the ipad to return to revenue growth by the end of 00NUMBER00. given the steep declines that the ipad product line has seen in recent quarters this seems to be shall we say optimistic. however i do think its a worthwhile exercise to speculate as to why cook has such confidence in a recovery in the growth trajectory of the product line. digging deeper    its not clear from the 00NUMBER00 report whether cook was referring to calendar 00NUMBER00 or to fiscal 00NUMBER00 which ends in september. if i had to hazard a guess id bet that his comments referred to fiscal 00NUMBER00. heres why. in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 apple only had the ipad pro on sale for part of the quarter. i suspect that this will mean that some demand for the ipad pro will be pushed into the second fiscal quarter of the year the current quarter  which should help provide a boost to revenue. additionally since apple didnt release new ipad products in the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 it should be able to enjoy a bit of a tailwind on a year over year comparison. where things get even more interesting is that if apple is planning to launch the ipad air 00NUMBER00 at an event in march suggesting that sales and revenue wont affect apples top and bottom lines until the companys third fiscal quarter of the year this should help to provide a boost in revenue. indeed in the first full quarter the ipad air 00NUMBER00 was available apple enjoyed a big sequential boost in ipad units and revenue 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively thanks to the ramp up of the product even if year over year the ipad was down. i suspect that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 introduction should enable a similar sequential bump over the results that apple will report in the fiscal second quarter. such a surge in ipad revenue would make the year over year comparison very favorable albeit not quite apples to apples so to speak. i suspect that this rather than any major fundamental change in ipad demand is how cook plans to make good on this promise to his employees. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  with concerns over the strength of iphone sales and last weeks uninspiring earnings report shares of apple. have sagged. adding insult to injury rival alphabet  s blowout earnings release briefly grew its market capitalization enough for the search giant to steal apples long held title as the worlds most valuable company. aapl market cap  data by ychartsthings should get better heading into the second half  of the year with the impending release of apples iphone 00NUMBER00. and though a recent rumor regarding the iphone 00NUMBER00 purported flagship feature created some concerns this is one rumor apple investors would do well to ignore. the iphone 00NUMBER00 flagship feature    last week bloomberg published a report claiming apple has been quietly developing its own wireless charging technology that could make its way into the iphone 00NUMBER00. from there a number of other media outlets extrapolated the story to claim that wireless charging will feature prominently in apples forthcoming handset. however im not so sure about that for one specific reason. historically speaking apple has a strong record of opposing nfc or inductive charging pads like those currently found for many of rival samsung  s recent flagship smartphones the note 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 edge. specifically as apples veteran vp of marketing phil schiller noted in the wake of the iphone 00NUMBER00 release current wireless charging pads merely shift the need to plug the charging cord from the device itself to the wireless charging pad. so the core technology doesnt alleviate the pain point of charging which usually involves being within arms reach of an outlet. true numerous reports say that apple plans to eliminate the headphone jack in the forthcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 to further push the boundaries of smartphone thinness. however it makes sense that apple will either develop headphones that work with apples lightning power connector or operate via bluetooth. this doesnt strike me as a sign that apple is intent on combining wireless charging in this years iphone form factor revamp. worth the wait   rather in keeping with apples preference to develop exciting new hardware specs expect apple to pursue wireless charging integration only when it can produce the kind of wow factor apple loves to engender from its users. according to reports apple has such a technology in the works but it probably sits more than a single product cycle into the future. in an effort to untether the iphone from power outlets apple is reportedly working toward a technology that would allow the iphone to charge itself through another apple device like an updated imac that includes the necessary components to power such a feature. though its just a rumor at this early stage and its worth noting that many of apples patents never appear in its devices this strikes me as the kind of breakthrough technology that solves a problem by creating an entirely new method for achieving the desired result. this also strikes me as the kind of major hardware innovation that apple might prefer to introduce with its odd year iphone 00NUMBER00. it appears apple prefers to position major features in its s series iphones things such as force touch touch id and siri. this makes strategic sense as it helps differentiate the new s series iphone from the preceding iphone that shares the same form factor. rest assured that as we head toward its likely september launch apple iphone 00NUMBER00 rumors will approach a fever pitch. however in terms of this specific rumor my moneys on seeing wireless charging surface in a more impressive way no sooner than the iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its

00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost   for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to climb 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return

industrial design of its next generation flagship iphones. per the site the new iphones will see the elimination of the rear camera bump that many iphone owners as well as if comments from a former apple intern are to be believed via business insider   apple chief design officer jonathan ive thought looked bad. the next major design change that apple will reportedly bring to the table is the elimination of a good portion of the antenna bands found on the back of the current iphone 00NUMBER00 designs. the antenna lines are still said to remain on the sides as well as on the top suggesting that the device will still be made of aluminum rather than the new metal alloy lookalike material  that apple patented some years ago. aside from that macrumors  reports citing a source that has provided reliable information previously that the new iphone will look quite similar to the current generation iphones. antenna band removal flush camera and thinner too    although macrumors  source could not verify whether or not the device will be thinner kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo published a note a while back suggesting that apple is aiming for a thickness of between 00NUMBER00 millimeters and 00NUMBER00 millimeters. if what kuo published a while back is correct then the new iphones should be quite a bit thinner than the current 00NUMBER00 plus phones which measure in at thicknesses of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 millimeters respectively. understanding the challenges associated with slimming these phones down    there are certainly factors that are more important than making the device even thinner than it is now. apple needs to deliver a significant improvement in camera technologyquality relative to the prior generation. it also needs to include a faster processor add a substantially enhanced and potentially higher resolution display and more goodies. apple faces something of a tug of war between these two diametrically opposed requirements. on one hand developing higher performance cameras and displays are already quite difficult. by trying to advance both camera and display technology while simultaneously making the device slimmer apple and its suppliers face a substantially bigger challenge. the good news though is that apple has had a couple of years at least to try to work on those new technologies since the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. in addition to quite a lot of time apple has also dramatically increased  its research and development spending in recent years which should allow it to tackle these increasingly difficult technical challenges in the compressed timeframes that apple has to develop each new iphone. the iphone 00NUMBER00 sounds like it will be a very refined iphone 00NUMBER00 plus    so far it seems as though from an industrial design perspective the next generation iphones will be highly refined versions of the already very successful iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. although some may be hoping for a bigger change than that its good that apple is addressing two of the biggest pain points that customers had with the prior generation phone design. given that apple now more than ever needs to convince buyers to upgrade to next generation devices such enhancements are more than welcome. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks

reflect those of nasdaq inc.  much to the chagrin of many in the investment community apple  does not break out its unit sales and revenues of its newest product category the apple watch. this secrecy is according to apple ceo tim cook due to apple not wanting to give its competition insight. investors can with some guesswork and sensible assumptions around average selling price get a reasonable handle on how this business is doing by looking at the changes in revenue in the companys other products segment. interestingly though at a recent meeting with apple employees apple executives reportedly revealed some very interesting unit shipment numbers for apple watch during the first quarter of the companys fiscal 00NUMBER00. better holiday sales than the original 00NUMBER00 citing multiple sources in attendance of this event reports that cook said that apple watch sales last quarter exceeded sales of the original iphone during its very first holiday quarter all the way back in 00NUMBER00. according to apples form 00NUMBER00 k filing from february 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones in the quarter ending on dec. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. given that blended average selling prices of apple watch are likely lower than those of the original iphone whether cook was referring to revenue or units we know that apple sold at 00NUMBER00 million apple watch units during the most recent quarter. so far so good but will the momentum continue    given how popular apple is and given that the apple watch represents apples next big thing its not surprising to see it do so well during its first year though it probably isnt living up to the hyper inflated expectations from a number of the sell side analysts. the key thing to watch will be whether apple watch will continue to see momentum in the coming quartersyears. on one hand im inclined to be optimistic because theres just so much  that the current apple watch cant do that it will be able to do as technology advances. the current model has very weak hardware inside which fundamentally limits it as a computing device. i suspect that as technology advances particularly ultra low power chip manufacturing technology the apple watch will be unleashed in much the same way that the iphone was. on the other hand i cant help but wonder if the apple watch will see the same fate as the ipad. this product category was white hot for a while with industry and stock market analysts predicting that tablets in general would simply continue to grow and grow. the reality is that tablet upgrade cycles are long and they were to a very real extent cannibalized by the proliferation of larger screen smartphones. i believe that apple watch upgrade cycles will be at least  as long as ipad upgrade cycles if not even longer. this means that apple should enjoy revenue growth as the products go increasingly mainstream but once most of the folks who want apple watches have them sales may nose dive much in the same way that ipad sales have over the last year or so. itll be interesting to see how this all plays out over the next couple of years thats for 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode

staggering 00NUMBER00 from its highs of the last year due to concerns about declining sales in the coming quarter. management is expecting total sales during the march 00NUMBER00 quarter to be in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion which would represent a year over year decline of 00NUMBER00 at the midpoint. nevertheless selling apple stock at these prices could be a major mistake. apple stock looks undervalued the years of explosive growth are most probably in the past for apple however this is already reflected in the current valuation to a good degree. apple stock is trading at a price to earnings ratio around 00NUMBER00 this is a huge discount versus the average company in the sp 00NUMBER00 index which carries a price to earnings ratio around 00NUMBER00. growth may be slowing down but fundamental soundness is unquestionable. apple owns one of the most valuable brands in the tech industry the company has nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and liquid investments on its balance sheet and the business generates huge profit margins in the neighborhood of 00NUMBER00 of revenue at the operating level. apple produced 00NUMBER00 billion in operating cash flow last quarter and management rewarded shareholders with 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends and buybacks over the period. when it comes to competitive differentiation financial strength and profitability apple is far superior to most companies in the market. even assuming that growth will permanently slow down the current valuation looks quite attractive for investors in apple at this stage. can apple jump start growth the iphone 00NUMBER00 was an explosive success for apple last year many customers were avidly attracted toward the new iphone models with a larger screen and apple registered a big sales increase of 00NUMBER00 during the fiscal year ended in september of 00NUMBER00. this will make annual comparisons remarkably difficult for apple in the coming quarters especially since the iphone 00NUMBER00 is no game changer in comparison to its predecessor. on the other hand ceo tim cook said in the latest earnings conference call that nearly 00NUMBER00 of all iphone users have not yet upgraded to the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00. these devices are getting increasingly outdated over time and apple users are notoriously loyal to their favorite brand. it doesnt sound too unreasonable to expect improved sales performance from the iphone segment as more customers upgrade their devices in the coming years. also according to cook the rate of switchers from android was the highest ever last quarter so apple seems to be gaining strength versus the competition in smartphones. emerging markets are going through significant economic turmoil lately yet apple announced a 00NUMBER00 increase in iphone unit sales in china last quarter. similarly iphone sales grew 00NUMBER00 in india and more than 00NUMBER00 in korea middle east and africa during the period. even under challenging economic times apple is still finding promising growth venues in emerging markets. its important to look at quarterly financial reports with perspective iphone unit sales grew 00NUMBER00 in the september 00NUMBER00 quarter but nobody would reasonably expect that kind of performance to be sustained over several years. similarly it doesnt make a lot of sense to expect a sustained decline in iphone sales only because management is expecting falling sales in the coming quarter. over a time horizon of multiple years chances are that iphone sales will continue moving in the right direction although at a much slower rate than in the past. nearly 00NUMBER00 of apple total revenue came from the iphone segment last quarter so this product will remain crucial for the company in the middle term. however apple is also betting on new products and services with initiatives such as apple watch apple tv apple music and apple pay among others. sales in the services segment grew 00NUMBER00 last quarter accounting for 00NUMBER00 of revenue during the period. the other products segment which includes apple tv apple watch and beats registered a 00NUMBER00 jump in revenue and it represented 00NUMBER00 of sales during the quarter. these high growth segments will most probably continue outgrowing the rest of the business in the coming years and they should have a positive impact on overall revenue growth over the long term. the main point is that apple is facing falling sales in the short term however thats not a good reason to sell the stock at current price levels. apple is remarkably cheap considering its fundamental quality and chances are that revenue growth will improve over the middle term. if anything the recent decline in apple stock seems to be offering a compelling opportunity for long term investors. the next billion dollar isecret  the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event

traded companies that have to answer to their respective shareholders. as a result the investment community can at least get hints  here and there of what to expect from future apple products. after listening to apple display vendor japan displays earnings call and going through its earnings presentation i think that some reasonable inferences about the display technology that apple will use for iphone 00NUMBER00 can be made. shift to pixel eyes gen. 00NUMBER00 displays in cell touch display technology is marketed as pixel eyes. i believe that the iphone 00NUMBER00 families of smartphones use some variation of this technology. interestingly according to japan display its second generation of pixel eyes displays will begin volume shipments in the companys fourth fiscal quarter in other words the current quarter. the new displays according to a slide accompanying the earnings presentation should allow for narrower display borders deeper black levels and increased touch sensitivity. additionally the company believes that by the first quarter of the companys fiscal 00NUMBER00 shipments of its second generation pixel eyes display technology will exceed sales of its first generation pixel eyes displays. given that the first quarter of the companys fiscal 00NUMBER00 begin in marchapril and end in junejuly right around when apple should be beginning the volume ramp up for iphone 00NUMBER00 it seems that japan display is counting on apple to adopt these next generation displays. how about a shift to advanced low temperature polysilicon    in a recent presentation on the companys technology development japan display has been talking about introducing a new backplane technology that it dubs advanced low temperature polysilicon or advanced ltps. in a nice explanation from android authority   the backplane of a display contains an array of transistors which are responsible for turning the individual pixels on and off and ultimately impacts display resolution refresh rate and quite importantly for mobile applications power consumption. indeed in its technology presentation japan display was keen to talk up the power consumption benefits of advanced ltps relative to standard ltps. shifting back to the earnings presentation japan display indicated that adoption of advanced ltps displays will begin early in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 and ramp strongly into fiscal 00NUMBER00. this leads me to believe that there is a reasonable chance that we see this technology in the next iphone. with the power reductions enabled by this advanced ltps apple may be able to offer increased display resolutions on both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus without seeing a negative impact on battery life. looking beyond iphone 00NUMBER00 display made it clear that it is boosting its research and development efforts around oled based displays which apple is expected to adopt in the 00NUMBER00 timeframe. perhaps not so coincidentally japan display executives say that the company is increasing its resources in order to hit its claim of mass production start on oled displays in 00NUMBER00. if thats not a solid indicator that the idevice maker plans to adopt oleds in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then i dont know 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode

part of the apple  story during its last product cycle has been market segment share gains against high end android vendors such as samsung. indeed as samsungs mobile revenue plunged during the 00NUMBER00 plus cycle apples iphone related revenue soared. although it reported record iphone shipments in the first quarter of its fiscal 00NUMBER00 albeit helped along with some channel inventory fill that wasnt there a year ago apples revenue in the americas region dropped 00NUMBER00 year over year. at the same time a new research report from market intelligence firm parks associates shows that in 00NUMBER00 samsung actually began to close the gap with apple in terms of installed base share in the united states. indeed per the report 00NUMBER00 of smartphone users now have samsung devices 00NUMBER00 percentage points behind apple at 00NUMBER00. it would appear then that apple is losing unit share to samsung in this region which unsurprisingly is apples largest. not totally apples to apples    its important to note that samsung tends to very aggressively cut prices on older generation phones as well as even its latest phones mid cycle. for example the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte 00NUMBER00 which launched less than a year ago sells for just 00NUMBER00 or so without a contract. older samsung devices like the galaxy 00NUMBER00 can be had for under 00NUMBER00 without a contract. the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone 00NUMBER00 now more than a year old still sells for 00NUMBER00 without a contract. for even more storage 00NUMBER00 gigabyte model is available for 00NUMBER00. moving up to apples latest phones the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte 00NUMBER00 can be had for 00NUMBER00 and itll run customers 00NUMBER00 to get the device in a 00NUMBER00 gigabyte configuration. although apple and samsung are clearly close in terms of unit share in north america apple obviously has a significant advantage in terms of average revenue and likely gross profit per device. maintain or grow share without sacrificing profitability    as overall smartphone market growth wanes apple will need to focus on trying to grow market share to drive revenue growth. additionally since apple seems interested in growing its installed base in a bid to further monetize it unitshare growth will be critical. one thing that i can see working in apples favor is the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. in addition to potentially catalyzing an upgrade cycle among the current installed base it is likely to waterfall the current iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones to the price points that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus currently occupy. where things have the potential to get even more interesting though is that apple could actually keep the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus around and push them to even lower price points following the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launches. this would put 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone 00NUMBER00 at 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at 00NUMBER00. these prices are still fairly high as far as the overall smartphone market goes but as far as iphones go theyre quite inexpensive. and although those phones will be a couple of generations old by then theyll still be excellent large screen devices that could serve as a nice low cost entry point into the apple ecosystem for budget conscious smartphone customers. and of course for customers who want a smaller screen the rumored upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 should do quite nicely especially since it is said to have better internal specifications than the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry finally bites the dust. just like newspaper publishers

pleasant for investors over the past few months. aapl  data by ychartslate last month the mac maker posted results that disappointed the market even as it set a record for the most profitable quarter ever in the process. apples guidance also forecast its sales to contract year over year for the first time in 00NUMBER00 years. investors werent happy. however as the company emphasized on its conference call its sprawling services empire continues to thrive. and though apple will live and die by the iphone until other big ticket projects  reach the market another development points to apples continued dominance in areas like apple pay. apple pays explosive growth    in the weeks since apples earnings a number of metrics have come to light that testify to apple pays impressive growth since its 00NUMBER00 debut. on its conference call apple reported that over 00NUMBER00 million points of payment currently support apple pay. furthermore a recent bloomberg report claims that apple pay availability now exceeds 00NUMBER00 million total retail locations up substantially from apples reported internal goal of 00NUMBER00 million retail locations by the end of 00NUMBER00. whats more thanks to its increased exposure apple pay has seen an acceleration in usage. on its recent investor call apple said its mobile payments solution saw its growth rate accelerate over tenfold from the first half of 00NUMBER00 to the second half. and with mobile payments expected to increase 00NUMBER00 billion last year to 00NUMBER00 billion in 00NUMBER00 the outlook for apples mobile payment product remains favorable. while its impact in isolation might not move the needle for apple investors shouldnt underestimate the effect of increasingly key services such as apple pay as part of its broader ecosystem. source appleall about the ecosystem   though apple itself has never publicly disclosed apple pays exact financial terms its unlikely that the mobile payments platform produces meaningful profits. according to numerous sources apple collects a mere 00NUMBER00 of each transaction that occurs through its payments platform. thats 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 which virtually guarantees that the service makes an indistinguishable impact on the companys bottom line. said another way if apple pay theoretically captured the entirety of the 00NUMBER00 billion in mobile transactions made in 00NUMBER00 the tech giant would have yielded revenue of 00NUMBER00 million. that might sound like a lot but its only 00NUMBER00 of apples fy 00NUMBER00. so were not talking about a deficiency on apple pays part as much as how its contribution pales in light of how massive apple is. apple is betting that mobile payments will become a core feature for smartphones in the future and thats a bet that usage data supports. according to a report by pymnts 00NUMBER00 of those who own a compatible device an iphone 00NUMBER00 or later reported as having tried apple pay up from 00NUMBER00 in late 00NUMBER00. though each major mobile platform has its own mobile payments offering these kinds of habit forming products help contribute to the stickiness of apples platform which directly affects apples ability to repeatedly sell its high priced hardware to consumers. so while apple pay in isolation wont move apples massive financial needle its also important to remember that the service carries more value than investors might initially think. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall

market share of 00NUMBER00. the biggest loser is device agnostic smartwatch maker pebble whom idc expects to see its market share drop from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 as market share consolidates among the major players. what to do when the next big thing is less big than the current big thing    in many ways the smartwatch market is starting to resemble the current big thing the high end smartphone market with the most visible participants being apple and android vendor samsung. the latters gear 00NUMBER00 model is compatible with most android units allowing it to consolidate market share among android powered smartphones especially those without a smartwatch offering of their own. unfortunately for investors dont look for smartwatches to be a top line silver bullet against slowing smartphone sales. the first issue is smartwatch adoption will be limited as the device is simply a companion piece versus a stand alone gadget like a smartphone. gartner forecasts nearly 00NUMBER00 million smartwatch sales this year versus smartphone sales in excess 00NUMBER00 million units. secondly a large product mix transition would hurt the top line as average selling prices or asps of smartwatches are lower. last year a survey from wristly found the asp for apple watch to be 00NUMBER00 samsungs gear 00NUMBER00 retails at 00NUMBER00. unfortunately we have to rely on third party estimates because neither apple nor samsung individually report smartwatch results. as a comparison apple produced 00NUMBER00 billion in iphone revenue while reporting 00NUMBER00 billion in other products revenue  the division that apple reports apple watch results in with ipod apple tv and beats products. even if apple captured gartners full year 00NUMBER00 market projection for smartwatches 00NUMBER00 billion it would be less than the company made in iphone related revenue any quarter this year. smartwatches will be value accretive to these tech firms but it wont be the next big thing for investors. this 00NUMBER00 trillion industry could destroy the internet   one bleeding edge technology is about to put the world wide web to bed. and if you act quickly you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism. . . the economist

of success for apple  aapl   but has altered the perception required to properly sense reality. similar to the dynamic that exists between rivaling siblings having the iphone become the single most successful consumer technology product in history has produced an environment in which every subsequent apple product decision has failed to meet the expectations set by iphone. as a consequence questions and doubts surrounding new apple products and services have emerged even though there are tangible signs of success and progress being made. the iphone has produced a new type of reality distortion field around apple. reality distortion fieldswhat was once a term used to denote steve jobs charisma and ability to turn the seemingly impossible or improbable into something achievable the term reality distortion field has taken on a few meanings over the years. one of the more recent examples was used by competitors to negatively point out apples ability to seemingly compete under different more hospitable terms. while the term usually took on a negative tone it always contained positive connotations related to apple either winning or succeeding in some form. however in recent years a new kind of reality distortion field has taken shape and unlike every version before it this one has negative connotations. the iphone has produced a type of twisted reality where perception does not accurately measure the amount of success being achieved with new products. much of this augmented reality is experienced by those closely involved with wall street and silicon valley. the older siblingthe iphones sheer success has changed the way we perceive new apple products services and apps. similar to the rivalry that may exist between siblings the iphone is the older sibling who has achieved a multitude of milestones and successes altering the very definition of success for others following in its footsteps. the major takeaway isnt that the bar has been lowered for new products but rather that progress and achievement are not being accurately measured and milestones are not being recognized. path to successit is difficult to argue the iphone shouldnt change the definition of success for apple. if managements singular goal is to remain relevant then a natural extension of that goal is for apple to build off of the iphones success. some may call this a burden. others will say it is a gift. however the dilemma that has formed over the years is that the iphones sheer success has altered the way we perceive success and the path needed to achieve greater success. people want apple to introduce new products just as successful as the iphone only without the multi year timeline and version reiterations that the iphone went through. even though the iphone was released only nine years ago much of the products history has been rewritten through subsequent stories and tales. many now think the iphone was a raging success out of the gate adopted by the masses overnight as everyone from high school students to corporate executives saw the devices potential at first sight. reality was vastly different. the iphone was introduced at a time when it was still taboo to own a mac on a college campus. the blackberry  bbry   was just beginning to take off as the luxury of having work email on a phone was too much for people to pass up. the average consumer was only starting to think about whether it was worth paying for a mobile data plan each month. after launching with one carrier in one country in 00NUMBER00 it took three years for the iphone to hit the mainstream with the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch highlighted in exhibit 00NUMBER00. exhibit 00NUMBER00 iphone unit sales quarterlyas a sign of the iphone reality distortion field in full effect when looking back at the iphones nine year journey observers often shorten and condense the long path to success into a much shorter timeline and then look for new products to follow a similarly quick path to mainstream success. case studies iphone reality distortion fieldwe have three case studies for how the iphone reality distortion field has impacted perceptions of new apple products apple watch apple music and apple accessories. apple watcheven though the apple watch has been compared to the iphone for most of its short life the true extent of this juxtaposition has been underestimated. in reality pretty much every single aspect of apple watch has been judged through an iphone filter. from the moment the watch was introduced in september 00NUMBER00 the device has been compared to the iphone all the way down to managements keynote slides being judged as less clear than those found in the iphone keynote introduction seven years earlier. when the initial wave of watch reviews were published the device was panned as being less useful as an iphone and not bringing up the same kind of feelings that people apparently had when the iphone was introduced. circling back to the older sibling example the watch was born into a world where early expectations were nearly impossible to meet. when management announced that apple watch sales revenue would not be broken out in financial statements the natural next thought among many was that such an action was due to the watch not being as big of a deal as the iphone the single most financially attractive product in apples history. initial wall street sales estimates for apple watch were based on iphone user numbers. initial watch upgrade cycle estimates were based on iphone upgrade cycles. launch weekend watch sales were based on launch weekend iphone sales. as each one of these events turned out to be quite different for apple watch disappointment soon took the place of excitement. we know apple sold at least 00NUMBER00 million apple watches in the first eight months on the market with a high probability of that number being closer to 00NUMBER00 million highlighted in 00NUMBER00. but many havent stopped comparing apple watch to the iphone long enough to add much needed perspective to those sales numbers. exhibit 00NUMBER00 apple watch sales above avalon estimateone way of reframing apple watch sales is to consider that apple sold at least 00NUMBER00 million wrist watches with an average selling price of approximately 00NUMBER00 at at time when large swaths of the population had tuned out watches let alone spent a few hundred dollars on one. in just eight months apple is selling 00NUMBER00 different watch models grouped into four collections. add in extra bands and watch faces and apple literally offered millions of unique watch combinations. . . at launch. despite these facts much of this success has been brushed aside because the watch doesnt have an app experience like an iphone and was not a good replacement for an iphone. the word replace does a poor job at explaining the whole point of apple watch in relation to the rest of apples product line. apple musicin just 00NUMBER00 months apple went from buying beats for 00NUMBER00 to having a music streaming service available in 00NUMBER00 with more than 00NUMBER00 million members paying for music content that is available for free elsewhere. apple recently launched apple music in china and on android which will add to that 00NUMBER00 million figure. despite this success many have written off apple music as a buggy apple service that shouldnt even exist. it may be difficult to see but apple music has also fallen victim to the iphone reality distortion field. the services path to success has been warped to such a degree that reality is no longer viewable. whereas spotify took eight years to reach 00NUMBER00 paid users apple did it in six months. many respond that apple musics membership total is the result of being a default app on iphone and apple having stronger brand recognition. this is evidence that the iphone reality distortion field is in full effect. any apple service that is found on an iphone is expected to turn to gold overnight with few bugs or problems. apple accessoriesin recent months apple has released a series of accessories for apple watch ipad and iphone. positioned to play off the intangibles associated with luxury   accessories are meant to make something more useful or versatile while also helping to create a different kind of emotion that would otherwise cease to exist. however there has been pushback against some of these accessories as people wonder why apple is dedicating resources to such minor products that will not sell at the same magnitude as iphone. whether it is a 00NUMBER00 apple watch charging dock 00NUMBER00 apple pencil or 00NUMBER00 battery case apples motivation isnt to sell tens of millions of each accessory or drive significant amounts of revenue but to enhance the experience. the iphone reality distortion field is at the root of the problem as people tend to discount minor products with a small financial impact as nonessential and irrelevant. managements responsehow should management work around the iphone reality distortion field instead of spending time in luca maestris office going over apple financials the best way to counter this twisted sense of reality is to spend time in jonys lab. by focusing on product and not financials it is easier to assess product development success and milestones. the root cause of the iphone reality distortion field is found with the iphones immense success. the stronger the iphone becomes the more it resembles a black hole where reality and perspective are twisted. fortunately for apple the immense level of success and opportunity provided by iphone represents a gift. the more successful the iphone becomes the stronger the motivation for apple to recognize the success but then work to move beyond the iphone. back in 00NUMBER00 ive discussed the motivation  behind the work taking place at apple our goal isnt to make money. our goal absolutely at apple is not to make money. this may sound a little flippant but its the truth. our goal and what gets us excited is to try to make great products. we trust that if we are successful people will like them and if we are operationally competent we will make revenue but we are very clear about our goal. jonys comments demonstrate apples strategy for dealing with the iphone reality distortion field let the products do the talking. by focusing on product apple can create a development framework for reiteration and improvement two ingredients for long term success. see also zoes kitchen the growth illusion  on

iphone 00NUMBER00 i believe that recent commentary from one apple supplier may shed some light on what the idevice maker may have in store for its 00NUMBER00 iphone the iphone 00NUMBER00. one thing that i have been critical of apple on is the fact that the company has traditionally kept its displays more or less the same for two generations of iphones. for example with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus apple equipped its flagships with industry leading lcds that were very widely praised. however when the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus came along apple recycled the same panels that it had used previously effectively bringing no improvement to the quality of the display. after going through comments made during a technology presentation from apple display supplier japan display i believe that apple may actually bring an enhanced lcd in the iphone 00NUMBER00 from the one it introduces with the iphone 00NUMBER00. a look at what japan display had to say    a key part of a typical liquid crystal display or an lcd is the backplane technology used. the backplane is a crucial part of a display and as android authority explains is a key factor that determines the kind of display resolution and power consumption characteristics of a mobile display. the displays found on apples current flagship iphones almost certainly use the first generation of japan displays low temperature polysilicon or ltps backplane technology. if we take a look at this slide from the aforementioned technology presentation we see that japan display plans to introduce a second generation advanced ltps backplane technology in its fiscal year 00NUMBER00 and a third generation in fiscal 00NUMBER00 source japan display. as you can see in this slide the second generation of ltps should lead to a significant reduction in backplane power consumption 00NUMBER00 drop. the third generation which the slide indicates goes into mass production during the companys fiscal year 00NUMBER00 can drive power consumption down by another 00NUMBER00 from the second generation. tying this back to apple and the iphone    the impression that i get is that these reductions in power consumption can be used in one of two ways. the first is to simply deliver better battery life at a given display resolution 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 or wqhd is used as the reference in the slide above or it can allow for similar power consumption at higher display resolutions. my bet is that apple will deliver a resolution increase with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the current 00NUMBER00 plus are behind many android flagships in this regard and then with the iphone 00NUMBER00 resolution constant while delivering other enhancements to the display quality in addition to a reduction in power consumption. will these features be enough to catalyze sales    i firmly believe that if apple had introduced meaningful new display technology with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the device would have been more attractive to a number of high end buyers. in my view this could have driven improved sales and potentially even driven average selling prices higher as the price reduced iphone 00NUMBER00 plus became less attractive in comparison to 00NUMBER00 plus. if im reading the tea leaves correctly apple should have access to significantly improved display technology at a quicker pace than it has had previously allowing it to deliver more compelling improvements in its displays generation over generation. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to

friday 00NUMBER00 mark gurman was served yet another scoop on apple  s rumored upcoming event. he had previously received word from some unnamed sources  that the company would hold an event to launch a new smaller iphone to replace the iphone 00NUMBER00 an ipad air 00NUMBER00 and new bands for the apple watch on march 00NUMBER00. and now hes reporting  that apple will begin selling these devices online and in stores just three days after the event. considering his reliable track record with apple rumors chances are his prediction will pan out. but gurman did note that his sources cautioned that the plans could still change. ipad air 00NUMBER00. image source apple. after reviewing in a recent article  what there is to expect from apples rumored mid cycle update to its 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 with a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone im now going to take a look at what there is to know about the companys rumored ipad air 00NUMBER00 and why it matters for apple. ipad air 00NUMBER00 a roundup of the rumors about the potential key updates to apples ipad air 00NUMBER00. the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will take design cues from apples ipad pro. one ipad pro feature the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will adopt is a smart connector or apples new interface for connecting an ipad compatible keyboard to the tablet. another key ipad pro feature rumored to come to the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is support for apple pencil. the new tablet is expected to sport apples 00NUMBER00 processor which was first introduced with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. the ipads camera will likely get an update potentially including a rear led flash. the ipad air 00NUMBER00 may sport an upgraded four speaker stereo sound system like the one built into the ipad pro. ipad pro four speaker audio system. image source apple. keep in mind that these are all rumors. and even if apple did intend to include any of these features in the ipad air 00NUMBER00 one point in the past the companys plans could have changed closer to launch. but gurman does confirm that his sources say an ipad air 00NUMBER00 likely be one of the products announced at apples 00NUMBER00 event. why it matters    apples ipad update is particularly important for the company because apples ipad segment has been on the decline. indeed ipad sales have essentially been declining on a year over year basis for almost two years. and highlighting the continuing challenging environment for ipad the segments revenue was down 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter in 00NUMBER00 and unit sales were down 00NUMBER00. with over 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue coming from iphones its easy to judge apples ipad segment as unimportant. but representing about 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in apples most recent quarter the segment is certainly still meaningful to apples overall business. indeed apples ipad segment was its second largest source of revenue in the companys first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 generating 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue ahead of mac revenue at 00NUMBER00 billion and services revenue at 00NUMBER00. given the overall negative momentum in the segment its unlikely that even a significant update to apples ipad segment will reinvigorate growth. but the ipad air 00NUMBER00 could help to moderate a decline in the business and maybe even help apple begin to hold sales in the segment steady throughout the year. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

00NUMBER00 during the past three months the companys dividend yield is starting to look better. indeed with the stock at these levels apple has a dividend yield 00NUMBER00 high enough for dividend investors to at least take a closer look. sure 00NUMBER00 isnt strong enough for income investors to get excited but it may be worth a bite once its growth potential is taken into account. apples dividend history    apples history of dividends is both short and sweet. initiating its dividend in 00NUMBER00 the company has only been consistently paying out an annual dividend for about three and a half years. but this short dividend history is at least marked by some nice increases. since the company paid out its first dividend in august 00NUMBER00 apples dividend payout has 00NUMBER00 increasing each year. apples most recent dividend increase was in 00NUMBER00. the quarterly dividend increased from 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 representing a meaningful 00NUMBER00 increase. notably apple has openly stated that it plans to increase its dividend every year. so the companys next dividend payout which should occur in may should actually be higher 00NUMBER00 as the company has already paid out four quarters of dividend at these levels. in previous years apple has announced its annual dividend increases when it reports second quarter results in april. during the companys first quarter earnings call in january management indicated that it planed to provide an update on its capital return program the same time this year. so investors can expect to find out by how much apple will increase its dividend this year in about two months. expect another meaningful dividend increase   there are plenty of reasons to expect another meaningful increase to apples dividend this year and many more years to come for that matter. the reasons all boil down to the companys fat balance sheet and its heady cash flow. apple store. image source apple. on apples balance sheet the company boasts a 00NUMBER00 billion in cash plus marketable securities notably 00NUMBER00 billion in a single quarter. and during the companys trailing 00NUMBER00 months apple generated a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion in free cash flow or the cash from operations left over after capital expenditures are deducted. and how much of this cash is apple returning to investors through dividends only about 00NUMBER00 billion annually. clearly the company has plenty of room for more dividend increases. no wonder management can openly tell investors it plans to increase its dividend annually. one common way dividend investors like to analyze potential income investments dividends is by looking at payout ratios or dividend payouts as a portion of earnings. apple aces this metric with a payout ratio of just 00NUMBER00. this low payout ratio leaves plenty of earnings for apple to continue to apply toward its aggressive share repurchase program and to put toward its cash hoard for future investments or acquisitions. and it also leaves plenty of wiggle room for the dividend if apple faces any significant headwinds that could pressure earnings in other words apple could still increase its dividend on an annual basis even if eps growth stalls or even begins to decline. with apples dividend yield climbing from about 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 the past twelve months thanks to a falling stock price its a good time to buy this dividend stock. and as a nice bonus investors will likely get yet another dividend increase in a few months. the next billion dollar isecret

next iphone and ipad will be unveiled at an event scheduled for march 00NUMBER00. the devices gurman says will be available just three days after the unveiling on march 00NUMBER00. the new iphone is said to be an upgraded 00NUMBER00 inch device. the device according to gurman will feature apples 00NUMBER00 processor a two generation bump from the processor in the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the camera subsystem of the plain iphone 00NUMBER00. its unclear whether the wireless subsystem will be based on the one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus or the one in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at this time. the new ipad is expected to be a 00NUMBER00 inch model a slightly overdue replacement for the current generation ipad air 00NUMBER00. the device is likely to come with upgraded internals and is said to support the companys smart keyboard accessory though gurman doesnt seem sure whether the device will come with support for the apple pencil accessory. what will the launches of these products mean for apple investors lets take a closer look. an end of quarter jolt to iphone and ipad sales    apple issued revenue guidance that was quite disappointing to many in the investment community. not only did the guidance suggest that iphone sales would drop but that they would likely drop by a non trivial amount. ipad is also expected to drop but that product category is fairly immaterial to the companys top and bottom lines compared to the iphone. apples second fiscal quarters in fiscal years 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 on calendar march 00NUMBER00 and march 00NUMBER00 respectively so id expect that the companys second fiscal quarter this year will end around the same time. this means that the new iphone should actually contribute to the companys second fiscal quarter results with the first full quarter affected by the device launch being the following one. the more interesting of the two in terms of potentially driving product category growth is actually the ipad air 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 inch iphone isnt a new flagship device its a product aimed at trying to serve either cost conscious customers or those who simply want a new 00NUMBER00 inch device. the 00NUMBER00 inch could drive incremental sales and if apple hasnt baked it into the current guidance could drive modest upside but its not a game changer for the category. the ipad on the other hand represents the next step in what is very much the mainstream ipad. the lack of a refresh of this device probably hurt ipad results last fall but should help provide a nice boost in sales once its available read more on how here. whats the real reason for these launches now  though    i suspect that apple held off on launching these products in the fall so that it could have products to launch mid cycle. apples yearly product launch cadence generally means a big spike in interest with a gradual falling off until the next major device launches. by putting out both a new ipad and a new iphone mid cycle apple is able to stay in the minds of both customers and investors for longer. and given how rough the current product cycle is shaping up to be apple needs to pull as many proverbial rabbits out of its hat as possible until it gets another shot with iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode

until late 00NUMBER00 offered its flagship iphones in one size 00NUMBER00 inches. this proved something of a problem as the market was quickly shifting to larger screen devices. however with the launch of the hugely successful iphone 00NUMBER00 plus apple was able to capture significant high end market segment share as well as boost iphone average selling price leading to a banner year for the company. that said the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus arent faring as well in the marketplace with the company expected to post its first ever year over year decline in iphone sales in the current fiscal year. interestingly it is rumored to be preparing a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone for launch in march but this phone is unlikely to drive the major boost in iphone sales that a new flagship would. this does have me thinking though that apple might be wise to introduce a fourth iphone size a device larger  than the current 00NUMBER00 inch iphone flagship. such a device could have a display size of between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 inches be packed to the brim with the latest technologies and priced even higher than the iphone plus models. in other words an iphone pro. if apple releases such a device in the spring alongside its newest 00NUMBER00 inch iphones then this could potentially be a boon for its iphone business. potential asp boost keeps customersinvestors excited    such a device launched in the spring could serve to offset the natural average selling price erosion that occurs throughout the iphone product cycle. remember were talking about a phone that would be newer and  more sophisticated than the standard iphones so it would be priced at a healthy premium to the plus model. additionally since the device would be more expensive than even the plus models apple would have more bill of materials wiggle room to use even more expensivecompelling components think displays memory camera and so on. it would also be an opportunity for apple to introduce technologies that werent quite ready for the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone launch in the fall. not only would such a device pack in premium components and carry a high average selling price but a launch of a true flagship device in the spring would allow apple to successfully maintain mind share among consumers as android flagships tend to launch in this time frame. good for apple its customers and ultimately its shareholders. the possible downsides    there are certainly downsides associated with such a product launch strategy. for one thing if apple were to launch such a device in the spring customers will assume that all future iphone pro models will come in the spring. this means that the buyers who would have traditionally purchased an iphone plus in the fall will now hold off on future purchases until the spring. to be sure such a purchase deferral wouldnt hurt apples full year sales but it could paint an unduly negative year over year comparison for a couple of years until such a release schedule is the norm. another downside to this is that although the iphone pro would be on top of the iphone heap in terms of technology and features it would be leapfrogged by the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 inch iphones launched in the following fall. itll be interesting to see what apple does from here    apple management generally knows what its doing and i suspect that despite the protestations that the iphone sales decline that the company is likely to face this year are due to macroeconomic weakness management is going to look for ways to ensure growth over the long term. introducing a higher priced larger iphone either in the fall or in the following spring is something that were i running the show in cupertino id be taking a very serious look at. 00NUMBER00 companies

month and the two headline products should be a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone as well as a refreshed ipad air 00NUMBER00. the company may have some announcements related to apple watch 00NUMBER00 but the wearable device isnt expected to see a full refresh until later this year. according to a recent report 00NUMBER00 both the purported iphone 00NUMBER00 and ipad air 00NUMBER00 will launch on march 00NUMBER00 just days after the event which is tentatively pegged for march 00NUMBER00. better yet the iphone 00NUMBER00 has already started to ramp up with production. what to expect when youre expecting a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone    while i happen to hate  the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 moniker apple seems intent on making its product naming conventions more convoluted. beyond what tim cook co. decide to call it the new smaller iphone should include the current 00NUMBER00 processor alongside an 00NUMBER00 motion co processor. better cameras are supposedly in store too and perhaps most importantly an nfc chip will be included for apple pay support. to date apple pay has been limited to apples larger handsets. the iphone 00NUMBER00 should look pretty similar to the current iphone 00NUMBER00 except maybe with some minor design tweaks. not everyone wants a bigger smartphone    a meaningful portion of apples user base has not  upgraded to the larger 00NUMBER00 inch or 00NUMBER00 inch iphones yet. we know that 00NUMBER00 of people that had an iphone before the larger models came out have not purchased an iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 plus. on one hand this represents quite a bit of opportunity  for apple if a lot of those users do decided to make the jump eventually. thats particularly true considering the storage pricing structure that strongly encourages upsells and boosts average selling prices for apple. but at the same time its also not as if all  of the iphone install base will opt for bigger iphones. there will always be a market for relatively smaller 00NUMBER00 inch models and its this market that apple will cater to with the 00NUMBER00. you might also remember that apple resisted the calls to go big for a very long time. years ago back when android oems were all flocking to larger models apple was still doing a remarkable job 00NUMBER00 inch smartphones. for example for a while apples older and smaller iphone 00NUMBER00 outsold samsung  s newer and larger galaxy s iii. there was never a rush for apple to go big even though it was always bound to happen sooner or later. now that apple has given in to market pressure by embracing larger phones its not as if apple has never looked back. clearly the company realizes that it needs to address all market segments. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds

brand thats instantly recognizable and loved worldwide. its run by a strong management team that though not perfect is generally able to respond fairly quickly to issues that arise. apple is also as far as i can tell second to none in its ability to attract and retain high quality talent to make things happen. at less than ten times trailing twelve month earnings though its trading at a little over 00NUMBER00 times estimates for the current fiscal year the stock just looks plain cheap. and i must admit that i am very  tempted to buy in at current prices. however despite this strong temptation im not buying in. heres why. apples core businesses probably wont grow this year    apples business units consist of the followingiphoneipadmacother productssoftware and servicesiphone is by far the companys largest and most important business and yet even in a smartphone market thats expected to grow modestly this year its shipments are expected to suffer a year over year decline in fiscal year 00NUMBER00. the ipad once viewed as the companys next big growth driver has also been in decline for some time and its hard to be optimistic that well see full year growth in this product category either. the pc market has been in decline for quite some time with apple managing to buck the trend and actually grow  in the last fiscal year. however the mac is off to a less than stellar start with units and revenue down 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 over year respectively to apples credit its still outperforming the broader pc market. other products looks set to grow by virtue of the ramp of apple watch and software and services also looks set to grow though these two categories are relatively small in terms of revenue and profit contribution for the company. all told the analyst community expects apple to see total revenue drop 00NUMBER00 year over year. hardly a harbinger of doom for the company but certainly a reason to be uneasy. buying now is a bet on iphone growth next year and beyond    i continue to believe that anybody buying  apple stock  now is likely doing so with the expectation that the companys sales and profit will return to growth next year and beyond. the only realistic way for this to happen is for iphone to return to growth. although there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle a return to growth in iphone is by no means assured. the company will need to bring out all the stops with this next generation phone. it not only needs to make a device compelling enough that it will rip away even more share from the high end of the android market but it needs to compel the roughly 00NUMBER00 of the pre iphone 00NUMBER00 plus installed base that has yet to upgrade to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus or later to get on board as well. i can certainly see many avenues of improvement for these next generation phones that i  would personally find compelling but im a fairly easy target as i love new technology. the key will be to bring enough features that are immediately obvious and valuable  to the average consumer to catalyze a major upgrade cycle. apple will surely be on extra leak control as it doesnt want to compound the problems that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are having in the marketplace with the osborne effect. however i will be keeping a close eye for any and all such leaks in order to try to determine whether the features that apple will be bringing later this year will truly be game changers or not. but for now i have no plans to purchase apple stock i simply need more information before im willing to commit to putting a meaningful portion of my portfolio into this stock. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are

 what happened   apple  s mobile payment service apple pay is set to launch in china later this week on feb. 00NUMBER00. reuters  reports that bank representatives for the industrial and commercial bank of china confirmed the launch on social media. the mac maker has previously said  that it expected apple pay to launch in china in early 00NUMBER00 with the countrys dominant bank card network so the upcoming rollout will deliver on that expectation. the industrial and commercial bank of china is the largest lender in the middle kingdom. two other banks are also reportedly launching on thursday as well. does it matter    china will mark the fifth new country for apple pay as the company continues its global deployment. but china is easily among apples most important markets particularly when it comes to future growth prospects. tim cook continues to reiterate his belief that china will eventually become the companys largest market. but mobile payments are more common in china than in the u. s. and apple will face plenty of competition from local incumbents. many messaging platforms have integrated payments services very successfully in china. while apple pay wont be a direct driver for revenue growth the payment service will certainly reinforce its broader ecosystem. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at

the companys share price has slide more than 00NUMBER00 and theres not much for investors to look forward to right now. the company found out last year that it didnt earn a spot in the apple  watch even though invensenses motion sensors were in nearly all of the smartwatches on the market at the time. invensense already supplied motion sensors for apples iphones when the apple watch launched which made many question why the company couldnt grab apples wearable tech business as well. and things have gotten worse for invensense as of late. the companys stock has taken another tumble recently as reports of slowing iphone demand have surfaced. apple is invensenses biggest customer so any iphone slowdown directly impacts the motion sensor company. on top of that invensenses second largest customer samsung   likely wont be using invensenses sensors in the next galaxy s device. all of this adds up to some pretty bleak prospects for invensense. click on the video below to find out

tech right now its rumored that samsung  will announce its newest galaxy iteration the galaxy 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge on feb. 00NUMBER00 in the lead up to the mobile world congress. samsung has a history of announcing its high end smartphone model during the worlds largest mobile industry convention and this year appears likely to continue that tradition. more recently pictures purportedly of the new galaxy line have started to surface. overall the design appears to be in line with the current gen galaxy 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge phones which many faulted as being similar to apple  s form factor. at this point most of the galaxy 00NUMBER00 features and specifications are still undisclosed leaving investors to wonder what new featuresimprovements the south korean conglomerate is bringing to market. however documents from the fcc disclose that the samsung galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge trounces apple in one metric battery life. my samsung what a large battery you have    in documents submitted to the fcc samsungs galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge boasts a 00NUMBER00 mah battery. this is much larger than the 00NUMBER00 battery the prior gen galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge model was equipped with. the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge already topped apple in battery life with samsungs posted times of 00NUMBER00 hours of talk 00NUMBER00 hours of music playback and 00NUMBER00 hours of wi fi internet browsing. the iphone 00NUMBER00 posted times of 00NUMBER00 hours 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 hours and 00NUMBER00 respectively. the reason is apples iphone 00NUMBER00 sports a smaller 00NUMBER00 mah battery a higher number means the battery can store more energy. with an upgrade to a 00NUMBER00 mah battery samsung would have a battery with double the capacity of its apple counterpart and the differences between those battery life estimates would only further increase in samsungs favor. if you are shopping for a high end phone simply on the basis of battery life samsung is the clear winner. samsungs conundrum    when it comes to battery life samsung has always presented a clear contrast to apple. in 00NUMBER00 samsung released a commercial titled wall huggers highlighting the galaxy 00NUMBER00 friendly features like swappable batteries and ultra power saving mode versus apples lack thereof. apple later added a low power mode to future models but samsungs next galaxy offering the current gen galaxy 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00 lost the battery swapping ability to embrace a unibody design. but as frustrating as limited battery life is it isnt what consumers base their buying decisions on. the same goes for fancy octa core chipsets or any other processor advantages. in the end potential consumers evaluate smartphones on ecosystemoperating system features and design more than on benchmark metrics. in j. d. powers latest smartphone satisfaction survey nearly one third 00NUMBER00 of customers select their phone based on its features followed by price 00NUMBER00 percent operating system at 00NUMBER00 percent and styledesign 00NUMBER00 percent. satisfaction is highest among customers who choose their phone based on operating system with 00NUMBER00 percent of these customers saying they strongly agree or somewhat agree that they feel loyal to the smartphone brand. the way for samsung to slow the number of android switchers a term apple ceo tim cook uses for former android users who have converted to iphone subscribers is not by improving device specifications but rather to present an intuitive user focused experience with continuous refinement. this is complicated by the fragmented nature of android as upgrades and updates require action  by alphabet   the handset maker and even the phone carrier. if samsungs new model doesnt improve upon the user experience the batterys performance will not move the needle and reverse the flow of android users shifting to apples iphone. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds

tipsthe indiscriminate selling from 00NUMBER00 barreled through to the new year giving the bulls a rough go of it in the first two months of 00NUMBER00. industry stalwart  apple inc. aapl    is currently down 00NUMBER00 from its 00NUMBER00 highs so the aapls 00NUMBER00 present an exceptionally attractive opportunity. especially since the bulls have not yet bought into  apple stock. on tuesday apple announced a 00NUMBER00 billion buyback program which presents a floor in apple stock. the buyback program makes shorting aapl more difficult. anyone who was considering going short aapl likely wont want to fight an uphill battle against apples buybacks so they would avoid shorting aapl stock. this makes the downside trajectory harder than the upside. as a fundamental trader i believe in apples balance sheet. its earning capability remains undiminished yet i still worry about how far markets will be willing to take the apple stock price from here. even though aapl on a technical basis is still vulnerable to more downside in the event of another market correction im confident apple will step in and aggressively defend its stock price. i rarely like to sell naked puts but given this special circumstance i want to use this strategy to profit from a long aapl options strategy. i especially like this strategy because of its minimal risk. click to enlarge   whats more theres no out of pocket expense to open this trade of which i will proffer up two flavorsoption 00NUMBER00 the aapl jan 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 put. for this i collect 00NUMBER00 per contract. this has an 00NUMBER00 theoretical chance of success. the absolute yield if successful is 00NUMBER00. the yield on current margin requirement is over 00NUMBER00. losses will come if apple falls below 00NUMBER00 per share. option 00NUMBER00 the aapl jun 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 put for 00NUMBER00 credit per contract. this has an 00NUMBER00 theoretical chance of success. absolute yield of 00NUMBER00. the yield on current margin requirement is the same as the other trade. my breakeven price is 00NUMBER00 per share. overall this strategy cost me nothing to enter and sets me up to profit even if apple stock goes nowhere for months. to be successful in both trades i need aapl to stay above 00NUMBER00 for the next 00NUMBER00 days and above 00NUMBER00 per share for the rest of 00NUMBER00. the worst case scenario isnt even that scary so long as im willing to own apple stock at a 00NUMBER00 discount from current levels. if apple falls lower than my strike prices i would be forced to keep my word to buy apple stock at that price an inherent risk to selling naked puts. i could modify this strategy by buying a few calls to benefit from a run up in aapl stock. but i am less convinced that aapl will rally than i am of its floor. more aggressive traders could step up higher than my strike prices for more premium. but i would rather make room for potential silly u. s. federal reserve actions with regard to rate hikes in 00NUMBER00. for apple stock to fall under 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 per share markets in general would need to be in dire straits. i dont see any current fundamental aapl issues that would cause it to correct alone. nicolas chahine is the managing director of  sellspreads  com. as of this writing he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post apple

   at the end of 00NUMBER00 but that doesnt say anything about what you should do with your own holdings of aapl stock. seriously. in a series of regulatory filings late tuesday we learned that famed activist investor and former corporate raider carl icahn greatly pared his stake in  apple stock. so did david einhorns greenlight capital and david teppers appaloosa management. whenever three of the best known hedge fund guys make a move like this its bound to be news. thats especially true given aapl stocks well documented struggles over the past three months a period in which its lost almost 00NUMBER00. as we now know these hedge funds added to the selling pressure in apple stock in the fourth quarter. heres the rundownnote that none of the above pulled out of apple entirely. its also important for retail investors to remember that the selling of stock never tells you as much about a name as the buying does. its the same with insider activity. hedge funds can sell for any number of reasons. portfolio rebalancing profit taking quantitative or technical analysis tipping points those are just some of the reasons a fund might pare back its stake in any stock. and lets not forget that a lot of the most famous hedge fund machers are getting shellacked by the ongoing collapse of energy sector names. besides its not like aapl stock lost all its friends in 00NUMBER00. tiger global management initiated a billion dollar position in the tech giant by buying 00NUMBER00 million shares. so although its interesting in a financial celebrity news kind of way it has no bearing on apple stocks prospects going forward. in more interesting news on the apple front the company with more cash than it knows what to do with just sold about 00NUMBER00 billion worth of debt. the proceeds will be used to fund its massive share repurchase program. returning cash to shareholders doesnt soothe investor concern over the state of iphone sales but it sure doesnt hurt. the company bought back 00NUMBER00 billion in aapl stock last year according to sp capital iq some of which probably went to icahn einhorn et. al. apple also paid nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends. if youre long aapl stock pay no attention to hedge funds selling shares. apple might have some serious problems but billionaires adjusting their stakes isnt one of them. as of this writing dan burrows did not hold a

called the 00NUMBER00 on march 00NUMBER00 with the device apparently becoming available shortly thereafter on march 00NUMBER00. quite a lot is known about this new phone but there are still some unknowns. the one that id like to focus on here is the display. although we know the size  of the display and its likely resolution its not clear whether the new phone has a fundamentally newbetter display relative to the one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00. i certainly hope that apple choses to outfit the device with an enhanced display. heres why. it might be a cheap iphone but its not a cheap phone    the new iphone 00NUMBER00 is expected to start at 00NUMBER00 for the model with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of flash storage with 00NUMBER00 gb version coming in at 00NUMBER00. these are by all means still premium priced phones and the competition at these price points is rather fierce. i believe that in order for the device to truly do what it needs to offer a compelling upgrade for current 00NUMBER00 owners and to deliver a high quality entry level phone  it needs to have a display befitting a premium device. the panel found on the iphone 00NUMBER00 first introduced with the 00NUMBER00 which will soon be four years old is not befitting a new device here in 00NUMBER00. apple cant go high resolution but it can bring 00NUMBER00 plus goodness to them    i dont expect a boost in display resolution in going from the iphone 00NUMBER00 to the 00NUMBER00 a resolution increase would mean that this budget iphone would have a sharper display than the companys current flagship. though not unprecedented the ipad mini has had a sharper display than the ipad air since the 00NUMBER00 it doesnt seem likely. what i do expect though is for apple to at least  give this display the kinds of enhancements  that it brought to the table with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. these enhancements included better color accuracy improved contrast ratio and improved viewing angles. if apple wants to get really  fancy it could actually test drive some of the new display technology that it plans to deliver with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus but that would create the awkward dilemma of the iphone 00NUMBER00 being better  than the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in some way. at any rate the next step in the evolution of the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone will be to introduce the same 00NUMBER00 touch functionality present in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. if apple doesnt introduce a new 00NUMBER00 inch panel in the iphone 00NUMBER00 then i wouldnt expect it until the 00NUMBER00 inch phone that comes after  the 00NUMBER00 successor since integrating 00NUMBER00 touch will be tough enough. well know soon enough    during these rough times for apple the company will need to pull out all of the stops in order to get customers to spend their hard earned cash on new devices. a new display wont be enough to get people to let go of those older 00NUMBER00 inch iphones but without one the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone might not bring enough to the table for iphone 00NUMBER00 users to even notice that theres a new 00NUMBER00 inch device worth upgrading to. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when

are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  according to an article published in fortune   billionaire investor carl icahn disposed of a full 00NUMBER00 of his position in apple. this comes less than a year after he sent a letter to apple ceo tim cook stating that he believed the stock was worth 00NUMBER00 share and urged the idevice maker to be more aggressive about buying back stock when the shares traded for well north of 00NUMBER00 per share. of course even after unloading a bunch of  apple stock  and turning a handsome profit on the shares the investor still owns more than 00NUMBER00 million shares after the sale. in light of this recent share sale its worth looking back at what icahn had to say in his letter to tim cook and why the investor may have unloaded those shares. icahn was expecting 00NUMBER00 per share in 00NUMBER00 probably not going to happen    in icahns letter the investor justified his 00NUMBER00 price target as followsto arrive at the value of 00NUMBER00 per share we 00NUMBER00 eps of 00NUMBER00 excluding net interest income apply a pe multiple of 00NUMBER00 and then add 00NUMBER00 of net cash per share. current analyst estimates call for apple to deliver 00NUMBER00 in earnings per share during fiscal year 00NUMBER00 a slight contraction from the 00NUMBER00 that the company reported a year earlier. even if we assume icahns earnings multiple of 00NUMBER00 is reasonable this would still imply a price target of around 00NUMBER00 per share. that would still represent substantial upside from current levels the stock closed at 00NUMBER00 as of writing but perhaps not the no brainer that icahn had previously championed. is an 00NUMBER00 earnings multiple reasonable    in addition to incorrectly predicting apples earnings per share in fiscal 00NUMBER00 it would seem that the earnings multiple that icahn believed that apple stock should command turned out to be quite optimistic. removing out the approximately 00NUMBER00 billion in net cash from apples market cap the current implied enterprise value per share is approximately 00NUMBER00. the market currently values apple at just 00NUMBER00 times projected earnings per share excluding cash less than half of the multiple that icahn believes that it deserves. although the case could be made for apple commanding a richer multiple and if iphone sales show signs of life in the coming cycle it could very well get one its important to understand that the idevice maker is still fundamentally a hardware company operating in a very fierce competitive environment. against the backdrop of seemingly endless competition the overall market for smartphones is also cooling off which will make achieving future growth that much tougher. why icahns thesis didnt and probably wont work    icahns price target was based on unrealistic earnings per share growth coupled with a bet on significant earnings multiple expansion. as fiscal year 00NUMBER00 plays out its quite obvious that neither of those things is really going to be in play this year. additionally icahn made reference to both an apple designed television set and an apple designed car both contributing to the companys revenue and earnings in the near term. its doubtful that the tv will ever get made if it were ever actually a real project within apple and the rumored car efforts seem to be years away if they ever actually make it to fruition. as icahns thesis appears to be no longer intact its no surprise that the investor decided to take some profits. itll be interesting to see if he takes additional profits in the quarters ahead. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are

according to multiple reports apples 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 right will have an extended release. source flickr user karlis dambrans. after warning investors that a decline in iphone demand is a risk to the stock apple  s worst case scenario now appears in sight. after years of posting strong year on year iphone revenue growth the company only grew iphone related revenue 00NUMBER00 last quarter. compared with earlier growth rates in excess of 00NUMBER00 this represents a significant slowdown for the companysource apples quarterly results. revenue figures in millions. apples forward guidance is even worse overall the company expects revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 year on year decrease at the midpoint from the 00NUMBER00 the company pulled in last years corresponding quarter. while apple doesnt give guidance of specific products apple ceo tim cook did acknowledge the company expected iphone unit shipments to decline in its second fiscal quarter. as a result investors have mostly baked in unit declines into the companys valuation with shares down 00NUMBER00 from that initial warning during 00NUMBER00 third quarter earnings. but could the market be selling apple shortthe strongest january since 00NUMBER00 to drexel hamilton analyst brian white   apple had its best january since 00NUMBER00. white bases his forecast upon supply chain analysis by looking at apples host of manufacturers and assemblers in what drexel hamilton refers to as its apple monitor. per the research note all of the companies in our apple monitor have reported january sales and the performance was much better than typical seasonality. drexel hamilton has a price target of 00NUMBER00 on the stock leading to a valuation 00NUMBER00 trillion  using current shares outstanding. supply chain analysis isnt a perfect indicator. in november huge apple assembler foxconn  reported third quarter net profit growth of 00NUMBER00 over last years total beating investors expectations in the process. the strong performance didnt extend to apples quarter as the phone reported the aforementioned 00NUMBER00 revenue growth. theres also supply chain data that conflicts with whites analysis  a report from reuters  suggests that foxconn will cut worker hours because of slowing iphone sales. could the iphone 00NUMBER00 be the reason for increased supplier activity    assuming whites analysis is correct its possible the increased activity wont show up in next quarters results. multiple reports say apple will announce a new iphone the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 a 00NUMBER00 inch entry level model during its march event. digitimes recently reports foxconn will manufacture the model and the increased activity a new product ramp requires would support whites thesis of a stronger than normal january. if thats true its possible the iphone 00NUMBER00 wont make a strong or any contribution to apples second quarter results. apples event is heavily rumored to be in mid march while apples fiscal quarter goes through the end of march. unless apple is aiming to release the iphone 00NUMBER00 around the time of the event its possible the majority of sales will be in apples third quarter. cooks warning about iphone unit contraction in the second quarter supports a third quarter release. but even if the iphone 00NUMBER00 doesnt show up in the second quarter results its an interesting proposition for cupertino will the lower end model introduce new users into apples ecosystem flop amid incongruity with apples high end user base see

customers said apple  ceo tim cook in an open letter published on tuesday. we oppose this order which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. in the controversial letter cook explains why apple is not going to build a back door to the iphone for the fbi to access customer information. republican candidate donald trump disagrees with apples refusal. who do they think they are trump said on wednesday in an interview with fox friends according to politico. they have to open it up. who is right    first its worth noting that apple isnt refusing to give the fbi any information the company has. the fbis request to apple goes much deeper than a search warrant for information already in apples possession. up to this point we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them cook explained. but now the u. s. government has asked us for something we simply do not have and something we consider too dangerous to create. they have asked us to build a backdoor to the iphone. specifically the fbi wants us to make a new version of the iphone operating system circumventing several important security features and install it on an iphone recovered during the investigation. in the wrong hands this software  which does not exist today would have the potential to unlock any iphone in someones physical possession. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. cook noted that while apple believes the fbis intentions are good the company believes creating what would be intended to be used only as a temporary backdoor could put every customers data at risk. the fbi may use different words to describe this tool but make no mistake building a version of ios that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. and while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case there is no way to guarantee such control. later in the letter cook provides a useful analogy to explain the danger of creating a back doorin the physical world it would be the equivalent of a master key capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks   from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. no reasonable person would find that acceptable. but trump strongly disagrees with cook. i agree 00NUMBER00 with the courts trump said. in that case we should open it up. trump was referring to the specific case this fbi investigation was about the san bernardino attack that killed 00NUMBER00 people. trump also believes the approach to customer security for digital security overall should be one that is open. i think security overall we have to open it up and we have to use our heads. we have to use common sense trump continued. one key concern in this argument for apple investors and customers is whether apple could be forced to go back on its word on not having a back door. but if apples findings are true that there is no precedent of an american company being forced to expose customer data to a greater risk of an attack then its probably unlikely the company will be forced to change its policy. who do you think is right cook or trumpthe next billion dollar isecret   the

tipsto no ones surprise apple inc. s   aapl    iphone sales dropped in the fourth quarter for the first time ever and aapl stock shrugged on the news. as well it should too. if this eventuality wasnt already reflected in the share price the market wasnt doing its job. weve known about flagging iphone sales for months. the 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus werent flops by any means. they simply werent as popular make that wildly popular as last years models. tough year over year comparisons are responsible for the decline. now that doesnt mean this isnt a serious headwind for aapl stock. just look what iphone worries have done to shares over the last three months a period in which theyve lost more than 00NUMBER00 their value. but the market as always is forward looking. investors might have to fine tune their expectations based on these more specific market research reports. perhaps the decline was a bit more than the market expected. that said the general effect should be already discounted in aapl stock. for the record iphone sales in the fourth quarter fell 00NUMBER00 to technology research company gartner. that led to a decline in iphone market share to 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. the iphone business is by far and away apples most important endeavor. anything that indicates deceleration in that segment is going to spook the market badly. some folks fret that apple has lost its mojo. maybe maybe not. what the market appears to be forgetting is that apple has been here before. growth was anemic before we got the iphone 00NUMBER00. and then it came back. besides aapl isnt valued like a growth stock anyway. heck investors are willing to pay only 00NUMBER00 times forward earnings for aapl stock. thats cheaper than utilities and telecommunications stocks neither of which are known for spectacular growth. its true the days of turbocharged growth might be behind apple. the law of large numbers catches up to everyone. however that doesnt mean profit has to decline over the next few years. indeed analysts on average figure apple has a long term growth rate of nearly 00NUMBER00 per year. aapl stocks forward earnings multiple is far too low to reflect that growth potential. you can see this in action in aapl stocks price earnings to growth multiple. known as peg this metric shows how fast a stock is rising relative to the companys growth prospects. for context the sp 00NUMBER00 has a peg ratio of 00NUMBER00 according to yardeni research. at 00NUMBER00 apples peg is almost half that value according to data from thomson reuters. it seems anything to do with slower iphone sales has been more than discounted in aapl stock. on valuation alone the tech giant is a buy. as of this writing dan burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post forget iphone sales apple inc. aapl stock is still a huge bargain  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  investorplace  investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tipswhile marketing professionals rarely simplify it to this degree there are only two kinds of publicity the kind you pay for and the kind you dont. the former is usually effective in proportion to the dollar amount spent on the effort. the latter while often unwieldy to the point of being completely uncontrollable can be infinitely more effective than paid for pr simply because consumers know beyond a shadow of a doubt its not being bought. while apple inc. aapl    has gotten really good at getting the most bang for its advertising buck the notoriety and public appreciation its won over the course of just the past couple of days has done  apple stock  far more long term good than any paid for marketing effort. hows that when the fbi asked the company to access a specific individuals iphones digital contents the company politely refused explaining it owes it to all iphone owners to not set a precedent putting its users at risk of backdoor security attacks. in other words apple is putting user privacy rights ahead of an fbi investigators hopes. any apple stock holders who believe guaranteed user privacy is a key selling point for the iphone should be impressed with the stance ceo tim cook has taken as its not a mere request. it was  a court order   from a u. s. magistrate. if apple continues to refuse it could lead to a very messy legal debate and perhaps even litigation. apple doesnt seem to care however. the iphone in question belonged to syed rizwan farook one of the two shooters in dec. 00NUMBER00 shootings in san bernardino that claimed the lives of 00NUMBER00 people including the two gunmen. the fbi has been investigating farook and his wife tashfeen malik ever since the shooting believing such digging could point to other homeland threats. the fbi was able to secure a search warrant specifically for the iphone as united states magistrate judge sheri pym saw enough probable cause to issue such a warrant. her specific orders  apples reasonable technical assistance shall accomplish the following three important functions 00NUMBER00 it will bypass or disable the auto erase function whether or not it has been enabled 00NUMBER00 it will enable the fbi to submit passcodes to the subject device for testing electronically via the physical device port bluetooth wi fi or other protocol available on the subject and…problem the iphone and newer versions of ios in particular were designed from the ground up to be as unhackable as humanly possible. the fact that the fbi hasnt been able to digitally break into the phone is evidence that apple did its job. thats why the agency is now turning to the manufacturer. apple could feasibly do it … but it would need to write specific code to do so which would effectively be a how to guide on how to hack into a locked iphone. that would be very bad for business and in turn for the value of apple stock. thats one of the reasons tim cook is adamant about not complying with the court order. another reason hes not doing it he simply sees it as an overreach of the government invading citizens including criminals civil liberties by forcing one of the entities the federal government is supposed to defend to become an arm of law enforcement itself. and thats the crux of the issue even if nobody fully understands it as such. ten years ago public opinion on tim cooks decision might have been different. that is with the echoes of 00NUMBER00 still ringing the public and maybe even owners of apple stock themselves would have agreed the company needs to do whatever it can to thwart terrorism or even non terroristic crime. a lots happened in that ten years however to suggest the federal government and not just the fbi has exceeded its privileged access to information. like ithim or not edward snowden did raise some legitimate concerns about how far was too far when it comes to eavesdropping. also during the last ten years its become clear that not only are search engines like google tracking and retaining years worth of browsing history but companies are building a digital profile of each of us thats far more detailed than one might have believed possible  just a few years ago including information like where we live. point being citizens are slowly losing their right to privacy but feel powerless to do anything about it. tim cook just empowered them a purchase of an iphone is an investment in your right to privacy. granted owning an iphone will provide any real privacy protection to an owner. most everyone is digitally vulnerable on dozens of other fronts and even the voice and text communications from or to a newer iphone are subject to monitoring by law enforcement officials  with or without a warrant. by standing up in support of the proverbial little guy thats slowly losing his constitutional rights apple just became the quintessential champion for that little guy. and thats a very good thing for owners of apple stock. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post apple inc. aapl the fbi just gave apple stock great publicity  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  much to the chagrin of many apple  iphone customers the idevice maker offers its iphones in storage tiers beginning with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes rather than say 00NUMBER00. this has the positive effect for apple of pushing customers who need more storage space to pony up an extra 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 model and its a move that is absolutely designed to maximize shareholder value. this strategy worked flawlessly when the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus were apples flagship phones if you wanted a large iphone 00NUMBER00 of on board storage the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus were the only devices that fit the bill. however following the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus the product stack gets a bit more well interesting. what does 00NUMBER00 buy you    if a customer wants to spend no more than 00NUMBER00 for an iphone off contract then said customer now has two  choices pick up a 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 or a 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 for the same price. now of course with the iphone 00NUMBER00 one gets a substantially faster processor higher resolution camera 00NUMBER00 touch more memory and other better internals. however i suspect that for customers who plan to load a lot of applications music and the like onto their phones the iphone 00NUMBER00 is simply going to offer a much more attractive value proposition. is this necessarily bad news for apple    revenue of 00NUMBER00 is well 00NUMBER00 of revenue whether it comes from the sale of an iphone 00NUMBER00 or an iphone 00NUMBER00. the question then is which of these devices is actually more expensive to produce. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 is more expensive then this might actually be a net win  for apple from a gross profit margin perspective but if the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 is then its a loss. lets do a head to head of the major subsystems of each device to try to determine which one is more expensive and why. i mark an x in the box of the device that i believe to be more expensive. subsystemiphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 implements 00NUMBER00 touch which likely adds significant costwirelessxiphone 00NUMBER00 uses more advanced cellular modem and wi fi. not only are main processing chips more expensive but 00NUMBER00 likely requires more rf content to support advanced wireless functionalitydramxiphone 00NUMBER00 uses 00NUMBER00 of 00NUMBER00 more expensive memory compared to 00NUMBER00 while the iphone 00NUMBER00 uses just 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 uses more advanced 00NUMBER00 series aluminumtouch 00NUMBER00 generation touch id likely more complex and therefore costlier though probably not by much to buildcamerasxiphone 00NUMBER00 uses more advanced 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 front sensorsnand 00NUMBER00 of nand flash is more expensive than 00NUMBER00 of nand flashdata source author analysis. aside from the fact that the iphone 00NUMBER00 has more flash storage it would seem that the iphone 00NUMBER00 is much more expensive across the board. this means that its very likely beneficial  to apple to sell a 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 than a 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00. brilliant simply brilliant. how about a bump of base storage to 00NUMBER00 gb    although many customers are hoping to see apple bump up the base storage of its next generation iphones to 00NUMBER00 i would say that there is practically zero  chance of apple doing this. it would much rather sell a previous generation phone with a little bit more commodity nand flash than sell the base configuration of its new iphones for margin purposes. endowing the base configuration of the newest iphone to 00NUMBER00 actually be gross margin dilutive  as customers are more likely to choose it over the 00NUMBER00 generation model. additionally those older phones wont hold up as long as the newer ones do in terms of performancefeatures so buyers of a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 previous generation iphone are more likely to upgrade sooner than those who buy the current 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable

mean apple shouldnt be concerned. source samsung. the way that apple    and samsung    approach different markets around the world offers insight into their smartphone strategies. samsung favors an all of the above approach by producing less costly units for developing markets like india  and its high end galaxy offerings for developed markets like the united states. while apple also performs well in developing markets china has been a particular bright spot for cupertino   its done so by focusing on the same high end units that it sells in developed countries. both approaches have proven to be successful. apple commands the highest market share in the largest developed smartphone market the united states while samsung retains the title of worlds  leading smartphone manufacturer. but while apple ceo tim cook has been upfront with his desire to grow market share by converting android users new reports suggest he may have taken his eye off the ball in the united states. samsung may be stealing u. s. market share    according to market intelligence firm parks associates samsung is closing the gap. apple remains the dominant smartphone manufacturer in the u. s. but samsung is catching up said mobile product research director harry wang in a parks associates press release. apple controls 00NUMBER00 of the smartphone market while samsung has 00NUMBER00 and lg is the next closest with rival with 00NUMBER00. while the press release doesnt go into detail losing u. s. market share is not what apple investors want to hear. while investors shouldnt be too worried about just one survey comscore  s recent december u. s. smartphone subscriber market share survey reported similar results. comscore reports apple lost 00NUMBER00 percentage points of total u. s. smartphone market share with subscribers in the last three months while samsung gained 00NUMBER00 percentage points. see the graph below for comscores quarter on quarter comparisonsource comscores december and september surveys. figures in percentage form or in millions. apple did grow its u. s. iphone user base during the quarter according to comscore. unfortunately apple did not grow its u. s. user base more than the overall smartphone market so its market share decreased. during the fourth calendar quarter total u. s. smartphone subscribers increased by 00NUMBER00 samsung increased its subscribers 00NUMBER00 and apple saw a 00NUMBER00 bump. while the easiest thesis is that samsung is stealing market share as consumers are shifting from apple to its high end galaxy models i think thats the lazy takeaway. while samsungs been coy about galaxy sales figures in the broader commentary of earnings calls the company has been somewhat dour about its mobile division. instead i think a large percentage of new smartphone users are late adopters who simply upgraded to smartphones due to lack of dumb read cell phone only options. these consumers are technically smartphone users in the respect they have a smartphone but in form they are still cell phone users as they consider their new devices simply a phone. and for these users paying high prices for apples iphone makes no sense. if this thesis is true apple will have to rely on refresh cycles to move new units in the u. s. in the end it seems apples real competition in the u. s. isnt samsung its antipathy and a mature market.

a close look at the company to see if an investment in the tech giant makes sense for them. bargains like this dont come around every day. here are six simple objective reasons i believe  apple stock  offers great value at this price and why its the stock in my portfolio that im the most optimistic about as an investment. 00NUMBER00. apple stock is on sale. trading at a price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 the market is pricing this market leader as if its revenue has peaked. comparatively the average pe ratio for stocks in the 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 about double that of apple. 00NUMBER00. the companys dividend is poised for growth. with over 00NUMBER00 billion in cash plus marketable securities on its balance sheet over 00NUMBER00 billion in annual free cash flow and just 00NUMBER00 billion spent on dividend payouts annually its dividend is bound to grow. indeed it plans to increase its dividend every year and i expect apple to announce a meaningful dividend increase in april. 00NUMBER00. apples share repurchases make a difference. when a company spends 00NUMBER00 billion repurchasing shares in just over three years it moves the needle. indeed its repurchase program has driven its share count more than 00NUMBER00 lower during the past four quarters alone. going forward the share repurchase program should continue to add value for shareholders especially with the stock trading at these levels. 00NUMBER00. pricing power highlights the power of apples brand. the rising average selling price for the iphone continues to demonstrate the companys pricing power which in turn shows how willing customers are to pay a premium price for apple devices. the average selling price for the iphone in the most recent quarter was 00NUMBER00 up from 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter and 00NUMBER00 in the same quarter two years ago. 00NUMBER00. the company is still growing rapidly. apples business has soared recently. trailing 00NUMBER00 month sales and eps are up 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively compared to the year ago quarter. yes growth in 00NUMBER00 is uncertain as the company faces the tough comparisons of its big growth last year. but low penetration in china and the growing importance of india may both serve as meaningful catalysts over the long haul. furthermore apple has historically been very successful in introducing new products and creating new growth segments  and the strength of its ecosystem would provide a huge base of interested customers for any new product categories it introduces in the future. 00NUMBER00. apples robust ecosystem keeps customers around. as an apple customer myself i know firsthand how its customers can get locked into its increasingly more comprehensive ecosystem of hardware software and services. and the companys growing emphasis on services and complementary hardware with products like apple music apple tv and apple watch only serve to entrench customers deeper. image source apple. apples growing service segment highlights how increasingly rooted customers are in its ecosystem. services revenue which was 00NUMBER00 billion in apples most recent quarter was its fastest growing segment up 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter  easily outpacing iphone ipad and mac revenue growth. ultimately with every apple device or app bought customers are probably less likely to switch to a competing platform. trading 00NUMBER00 below all time highs and with its pe ratio at 00NUMBER00 discount compared to that of average stocks in the 00NUMBER00 apple stock currently provides investors a low risk entry point. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

next month apple  is expected to launch a new ipad. the rumored tablet will be an ipad air 00NUMBER00 according 00NUMBER00 reliable mark gurman. if gurman is right the ipad could include significant changes taking some cues from the companys recently launched ipad pro. but will significant changes be enough to save the companys declining ipad segmentipad air 00NUMBER00. image source apple. declining ipad sales    apples ipad unit sales first started declining in the companys second fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 or about two years ago. and the decline to follow has been sharp. for context consider the 00NUMBER00 decline in ipad unit shipments between apples most recent quarter and same quarter two years ago. and ipad unit sales in the companys most recent quarter are down 00NUMBER00 the year ago quarter. investors are wondering whether this trend is temporary or representative of a long term secular contraction in tablet sales. after all the growing popularity of smartphones with larger displays phablets in particular is snapping up share from tablets. then of course theres the fact that the upgrade cycle for tablets appears to be much longer than it is for smartphones. a potential rebound    apple ceo tim cook has been optimistic about ipads even amid a decline in sales. were very bullish about the future of the tablet market cook said in the second half of 00NUMBER00 during an earnings call. cook has continually cited the ipads superior usage statistics compared to usage data for other tablets the devices popularity for commercial applications and apples pipeline innovation in the category as catalysts for further growth. even during an apple earnings call this summer via a reuters transcript   the ceo remained optimistic that the company can count on a meaningful upgrade cycle in the future. i believe that the ipad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur because as we look at the usage statistics on ipad it remains unbelievably great. the next closest usage of the next competitor we are six times greater. and so these are extraordinary numbers. its not like people have forgotten ipad or anything. its a fantastic product. during apples most recent earnings call cook cited data from npd that pegged ipads u. s. market share for tablets priced above 00NUMBER00 at an impressive 00NUMBER00. cook also noted an idc study asserting ipads account for 00NUMBER00 of the u. s. commercial tablet market. ipad pro. image source apple. while its not clear yet whether cooks optimism for the companys ipad segment is realistic investors shouldnt expect to see a rebound in the current quarter. with apples ipad 00NUMBER00 speculated to go on sale during the second half of march the new product will only impact about two weeks of the quarter. the true test to see whether theres hope for ipad sales to begin moving upward again will be the companys third fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which begins in april. apples ipad segment is still the companys second largest measured by revenue highlighting the importance of tablet sales to the company. notably however apples mac and services segments are close behind. ipad revenue during 00NUMBER00

bonds at the high end of expectations. due to recent global macroeconomic uncertainty the bond market hasnt been all that active especially for large cap names looking to raise some capital. but global markets are starting to calm down a bit so its about time to jump back in. apple needs more cash    much like with prior bond sales apple sold this batch in numerous tranches that go out as far

with this bond offering long term debt should increase to nearly 00NUMBER00 billion. as cfo luca maestri reiterated on the last conference call apple will continue to be very active in global debt markets to raise cash in order to fund its aggressive capital return program. investors should get an update in april on how apple will boost this program. for the most part this cash will be used for capital returns and other general corporate purposes. that also includes paying down other debt. you may note that the current portion of apples long term debt due within the next year is 00NUMBER00

renewable energy and improving energy efficiency throughout its products supply chain and facilities. use more environmentally friendly materials throughout its products. save precious resources. apple will evaluate various projects based on how they further these goals. the company wants to continue expanding its use of solar and wind energy while also utilizing energy storage. apple also

trend is that smartwatches overtook swiss watch shipments during the quarter potentially marking an important turning point in the age old industry. the growth was largely being driven by apple. can i get your digits    here are strategy analytics estimates on each category. the researcher estimates that apple grabbed 00NUMBER00 of those smartwatch units with samsung  scoring 00NUMBER00 which translates into 00NUMBER00 million units and 00NUMBER00 units respectively. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 millionswiss 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 milliondata source strategy analytics. that means that the two frenemies combined took home 00NUMBER00 of the global smartwatch market during the fourth quarter. compare that duopoly to the combined 00NUMBER00 market share that apple and samsung had of the smartphone market in the fourth quarter according to idc estimates. a numbers game    this leads to the next question is 00NUMBER00 million apple watch units realistic we know that apples other products segment generated 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter which was up 00NUMBER00 year over year. as usual apple continues to be opaque about apple watch sales for competitive reasons but the company did say that much of that growth was attributable to the growing contribution from apple watch. ive always operated on the assumption that apple watch average selling prices are right around 00NUMBER00 give or take 00NUMBER00. until apple opens up and proves me wrong i will continue to operate on that assumption. hard to tell when the pricing spectrum for the product ranges from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. at a 00NUMBER00 asp 00NUMBER00 million units would translate into 00NUMBER00. in dollar terms other products grew by 00NUMBER00 billion in the fourth quarter so apple watch would comprise more 00NUMBER00 of that growth. thats not too far fetched since its happened before  and apple watch growth is offsetting declines in categories like ipods. too much too fast    however i still think that 00NUMBER00 million units is too high of an estimate. even if we brought the asp down to 00NUMBER00 that would still be 00NUMBER00 billion in apple watch revenue. ipod sales are so small nowadays that the revenue base probably doesnt have much downside so its hard to imagine ipod revenue declines are that meaningful anymore. the last time that apple disclosed ipod revenue was 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 when it brought in just 00NUMBER00 million in ipod revenue. we also know that apple tv saw record sales in the fourth quarter which should be giving other products additional uplift. beats is in there too. i dont believe apple sold 00NUMBER00 million apple watches over the holidays. i also didnt believe strategy analytics estimate 00NUMBER00 million  apple watches in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 since it implied an incredibly low asp. just to fill in the gap strategy analytics estimated that apple sold 00NUMBER00 million apple watches in the third quarter which would bring its 00NUMBER00 total to 00NUMBER00 million. apple watch is undoubtedly dominating the smartwatch market but those figures are still too high. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the article

2016-02-22 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.6093673331249618,0.2387541782540445,-0.0008317574736193,a number of prominent tech journalists have started to question whether some cracks in apples  mobile and desktop software are going unnoticed or even getting worse. although none of these writers say theyre ditching their apple devices investors need to be aware of these developments given that the companys software and brand image are the foundation of its success. whats the problem    the criticism of apples software was recently kicked off by veteran tech journalist walt mossberg. in a piece  for recode   mossberg says over the last couple of years he has noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of apples core apps for both the mobile and desktop versions. specifically he singles out itunes for the desktop which he now dreads opening due to how bloated and slow the software has become as well as mail photos and icloud. one of the themes in mossbergs review of these apps is the failure to properly sync email and photos across devices as well as the inability to properly back up data in icloud. another prominent apple blogger john gruber chimed in  as well detailing his latest problems uploading and syncing photos. this is especially concerning because the appeal to apple users is everything should just work. finally jim dalrymple piled on with his view  on the matter especially noting how apple music has been plagued since the initial release and has finally been improved up to the point where it should have been from day one of the release. he offers his guess as to why  this happened concluding it is probably because they were given a rushed time frame for the product. personally i also wonder if the size of the company and the number of employees can lead to more bureaucratic and communication friction. the economic concept of margins    i can already hear the howls from apple investors so let me make a few things clear. first this kind of observation and speculation does not  mean apple is going down the tubes and investors need to sell their  apple stock  today. the point instead is that investors need to understand the concept of change at the margin. when talking about the economic concept of marginal change or choice it doesnt refer to the way financial practitioners use the term which is either to refer to profit margins although the two are related or the use of debt such as trading on margin. margin in this context means additional or thinking of the very next step forward. the first glass of water in the desert has a very high value but each additional glass is worth less as your thirst is quenched. we face marginal choices constantly in life. we dont choose whether or not to sleep we choose how many hours we want to sleep perhaps that extra hour of reading is more valuable than an hour of sleep. what does this have to do with apple when people decide whether or not to buy an apple phone or an android phone they similarly make choices at the margin. apple smartphones are on average much more expensive than android smartphones even though they both perform the same basic functions. however people are willing to pay the additional 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 or more for the apple phone due to its superior hardware and software. but if apples software becomes more buggy prone to errors or malfunctions this changes a consumers marginal choice. of course not everyone is going to stop buying iphones tomorrow. yet this is the point of marginal thinking if quality declines enough there will  be some on the fence that may now say the additional benefit of an iphone is not worth the additional cost. what should investors do with this information    as mossberg correctly points out apple products are not premium products just because of the high end hardware and materials such as metal and glass. rather apple demands a premium because it is the only way to get access to its wonderfully designed software and ecosystem that is supposed to work seamlessly across all devices. the marriage of hardware and software was a bedrock principle of steve jobs and has made the company what it is today. apple phones have the highest margins in the industry because of the software content and integration. again this news doesnt mean that investors should react by selling apple stock but they should be aware of a potential change in the companys product quality. this could be monitored through a couple ways. if the value of the software declines and people are not willing to pay as much for apple products then this should eventually show up through lower sales and increased share gains for android or other manufacturers. it could also show up in lower gross margins. so far it appears apple is holding its own in terms of market share but may be losing a bit  at the high end to samsung electronics. although revenue is expected to decline next quarter it is not yet clear how much of this is due simply to the slowing smartphone market in general. finally apples total gross margins and estimated margins on the iphone have not been weakening yet. in short this news is something investors need to be aware of and continue to monitor but its not a five alarm fire. it has actually been brewing for some time as mossberg stated he has noticed the degradation over multiple years and engadget raised similar points  in late 00NUMBER00. apple has top notch talent and perhaps the additional press will spur them to clean up this software sooner rather than later. in the meantime we as investors will continue to stay vigilant. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to

motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  this past tuesday a california judge ordered the tech giant apple inc. aapl  to provide assistance for the f. b. i. to unlock an iphone used by one of the attackers in the san bernardino shooting that 00NUMBER00 people this past december. as a report  from the new york times  states the ruling handed the f. b. i. a potentially important victory in its long running battle with apple and other silicon valley companies over the governments ability to get access to encrypted data in investigations. apple has maintained that requiring it to provide the keys to its technology would compromise the security of the information of hundreds of millions of users. apples ceo tim cook responded to the judges order with a  strongly worded letter  that challenged the courts request. the united states government has demanded that apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers cook begins. we oppose this order which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. cook continues by stating this moment calls for public discussion and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake. lets review the key pieces of information that need to be known about this issuearray. the specifics of the f. b. i. s requestthe federal bureau of investigation wants to examine the iphone used by syed farook to determine whether he and his wife tashfeen malik directly planned the san bernardino shooting directly with the islamic state isis. the iphone obtained is locked by a passcode and the f. b. i. wants apple to circumvent the lock. 00NUMBER00. why is apple resistingaccording to the tech company apple would have to build a new version of its ios smartphone software that allows the f. b. i. to bypass specific restrictions. apple claims this software can give someone the potential to unlock any iphone in someones physical possession. furthermore the company argues that the software the f. b. i. wants does not exist. but technologists say the company can do it. the same engineers who built strong encryption into the iphone to protect our users would ironically be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe wrote cook. the company does not want to set the precedent of compliance that can set for future requests from the federal government. there are few earlier rulings courts can use for guidance and apple does not want to pave the road for similar requests to itself and other tech companies. 00NUMBER00. the specifics of the court orderaccording to another report  from the nyt   the court is ordering the company to bypass or disable a feature that automatically wipes an iphone clean of all its data after 00NUMBER00 incorrect password attempts have been entered. if so this technically doesnt require apple to develop any sort of new decryption device or software rather allows the f. b. i. to perform unlimited chances of guessing the password without the iphone deleting all of its data after the ten attempts. 00NUMBER00. the justification of the orderthe justification of the judges order derives from a broad interpretation of the  all writs act of 00NUMBER00. the law lets judges issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. the government says the law provides latitude to judges compelling third parties to execute court orders. the government also cites a 00NUMBER00 ruling requiring phone companies to help establish a pen register a device that records all numbers called from a particular phone line. 00NUMBER00. apples response to this justificationapple argues that justifications scope has strict limitations. in 00NUMBER00 a federal magistrate judge rejected the argument that the law could be used to compel a telecommunications provider to allow real time tracking of a cellphone without a search warrant per the  nyt. 00NUMBER00. can the f. b. i. develop the software to do this instead of asking applethe short answer to this question is no. if you own any apple product but in this case an iphone then you know that their products are specifically designed to run on software solely created by apple. for the iphone to recognize its ios software was made by apple the company signs each piece of the software with a verified encryption key. the f. b. i. could create a new version of ios but it would not have apples signature on the software. 00NUMBER00. are people defending apples actionsthe people who are defenders of apple argue that the types of government surveillance operations exposed in 00NUMBER00 by edward j. snowden have forced technology companies to build tougher encryption safeguards in their products to ensure the privacy of their customers. privacy advocates are concerned about the f. b. i. succeeding by obtaining access to the software overriding apples encryption. this software would provide easy access for the government in many future investigations. alex abdo staff lawyer for the american civil liberty unions privacy and technology section is on the record  stating apple deserves praise for standing up for its right to offer secure devices to all of its customers while robert cattanach a former justice department lawyer who works on privacy and tech security issues at the law firm dorsey whitney explains the next thing you know theyll be in the back door of these systems. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  ahead of apple  s rumored iphone launch on march 00NUMBER00 investors are hoping the revamped smaller iphone can help beef up the companys top line and potentially save the tech giant from a possible year over year decline in sales during fiscal 00NUMBER00. according to one apple analysts projections via appleinsider   the new mid cycle iphone may indeed give the companys sales a solid boost. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. in need of a catalyst    for apples current quarter the company is guiding for revenue to decline about 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter. this is a huge change from the companys 00NUMBER00 year over year revenue growth during the trailing 00NUMBER00 month period. the bleak outlook has some investors concerned that the companys sales have peaked hence the stocks wildly conservative price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 a valuation that basically assumes apples business will no longer grow. with this guidance it mind its no surprise that apple is reportedly planning to launch an iphone about six months before it normally does. management is likely hoping the new iphone can reinvigorate iphone sales growth and help it resume revenue growth after the current quarter. if youve missed the rumors this expected iphone launch is aimed at replacing the companys iphone 00NUMBER00 which apple ceo tim cook said during the companys most recent earnings call is still selling well even despite being two years old. expected to sport a four inch display like the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 the phone will likely attempt to strengthen apples position at a lower price point. apple is still expected to introduce new flagship iphones in the fall as it usually does. while the phone is rumored to be introduced on march 00NUMBER00 to go on sale as early as march 00NUMBER00 investors shouldnt expect the phone to play a key role in boosting iphone sales for the current quarter as the current quarter closes at the end of march though an impact on the rest of the year is likely. the path to 00NUMBER00 billion    apples new four inch iphone could help the company sell an additional 00NUMBER00 million iphone units in fiscal 00NUMBER00 adding 00NUMBER00 incremental sales according to rbc capital markets analyst amit daryanani. these expectations for incremental iphone unit sales and revenue factor in potential cannibalization of flagship phones according to the analyst. iphone 00NUMBER00. with apples annual revenue currently at 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 in sales could add more than 00NUMBER00 to apples top line  potentially enough to help the company avoid a year over year decline in fiscal 00NUMBER00. daryanani believes the new iphone which is rumored to have a starting price of 00NUMBER00 could boast an average selling price of 00NUMBER00 only 00NUMBER00 behind apples average selling price for iphone sales across all of its models. at this average selling price the analyst estimates the new iphone could contribute 00NUMBER00 incremental eps for apple in fiscal 00NUMBER00. some of the primary buyers of the new smaller iphone according to daryanani will include those who currently use an iphone three more years older and india. cook did give a nod to india in the companys most recent earnings call. discussing the current environment leading to apples guidance for a year over year decline in revenue cook said weve also seen these times as opportunities to invest in new markets just as were doing now in areas such as india and other emerging markets. given that iphone sales account for more than 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue a mid cycle iphone would almost certainly be accretive to the tech giants business. and daryananis estimate that the phone could add about 00NUMBER00 to the companys bottom line does seem conservative. even more these estimates for what a refreshed three year old iphone can contribute to earnings highlights just how important the segment is to the company. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

past few years apple  has issued more than 00NUMBER00 billion of debt to fund its dividends and share repurchases. this has allowed it to avoid paying repatriation taxes of up to 00NUMBER00 on its 00NUMBER00 billion foreign cash stockpile. apple just revealed its first big debt offering of 00NUMBER00. image source the motley fool. on the companys 00NUMBER00 earnings call last month apple cfo luca maestri stated   we also plan to be very active in the us and international debt markets in 00NUMBER00 in order to fund our capital return activities. apple made its first move in this direction in the past week. apples first debt offering of 00NUMBER00 tuesday apple filed a prospectus to issue nine different series of dollar denominated bonds. in total apple is 00NUMBER00 billion of debt. of the new debt 00NUMBER00 billion is being raised for general corporate purposes which means share buybacks for all intents and purposes. however apple is also issuing 00NUMBER00 in green bonds that are earmarked for investments in energy efficiency renewable energy and similar initiatives. as a practical matter the distinction between apples green bonds and its debt raised for general corporate purposes is probably moot. apple was going to spend money on environmentally friendly projects no matter what. issuing green bonds will free up the cash it would have otherwise spent on these projects. the price is right    for apple issuing debt to fund incremental share buybacks is almost a no brainer right now. despite its rising debt balance apple retains a very high credit rating allowing it to issue debt at extremely low interest rates. in fact apple typically saves money when issuing debt to buy back stock because the added interest expense is more than offset by lower dividend payments. apple priced its recent offering at an average interest rate of less than 00NUMBER00. even its 00NUMBER00 year notes carry an interest rate of just 00NUMBER00. after the impact of tax savings the effective interest rate will be less than 00NUMBER00. for comparison apples dividend yield was 00NUMBER00 based on its thursday closing stock price of 00NUMBER00. furthermore apple is likely to raise its dividend in april increasing the amount of cash that it will save by buying back stock now. apple stock  is cheap    of course it wouldnt make sense for apple to spend money on share buybacks if its stock was overvalued. however apple stock is quite cheap having fallen back below 00NUMBER00 last month. apple stock performance. data by ycharts. its true that apples profit could decline on a year over year basis in fiscal 00NUMBER00. however the expected launch  of a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone the iphone 00NUMBER00 and an updated 00NUMBER00 inch ipad the ipad air 00NUMBER00 should keep any earnings decline manageable. meanwhile the stock now trades for less than 00NUMBER00 the average analyst estimate for this years earnings far below the average earnings multiple for the stock market as a whole. most importantly apple is well positioned to return to solid profit growth next year. the iphone 00NUMBER00 should ignite another strong upgrade cycle for apples signature product. apple ceo tim cook also expects the ipad product line to make its long awaited return to revenue growth later this year. finally a much improved apple watch is likely to be ready for launch by this fall. a return to stronger earnings results should lead to a revival in apples stock price. in the meantime issuing debt at rock bottom interest rates to buy back more stock will build value for long term investors. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool

from a journalists standpoint the headline  apple  prepares to enter tv business is something of a lay up. its also not true. as the business press reported earlier this week tech giant apple is indeed producing its own tv show. and while the news represents a noteworthy progression for the worlds largest public company its ultimate goals are likely to be far humbler than most headlines might imply. apple enters tv production   the show titled vital signs will star apple executive and hip hop legend dr. dre according to the hollywood reporter. the shows storyline will loosely mirror dr. dres unlikely rise from the violent streets of l. a. s notorious compton neighborhood to the heights of the global entertainment and business elite. source youtube. the news also represents apples gradual and overlooked progression deeper into video content production. apple financed drakes hugely popular hotline bling music video last year a business arrangement that was something of a double edged sword for the hip hop hit maker. apple also financed taylor swifts live concert video from last 00NUMBER00. both drakes and swifts projects were exclusive to apple music an important common thread in this narrative and one that speaks to the strategic value of vital signs  as well. not the next netflix   in theory apples strategy mirrors the original content that netflix  and amazoncom  have created to such great success. like smash hits house of cards  and transparent  before it apple also clearly intends to use vital signs  to drive subscribers to one of its entertainment services. however the service in question is apple music not the much rumored apple over the top television product. source apple. entering the on demand streaming market well behind first mover spotify apple has struggled to create key points of differentiation between apple music and its swedish rival. apple originally attempted to do so by marketing apple music around its curation capabilities only to have spotify introduce its own compelling music discovery tools  only months after apple musics launch. with vital signs   it appears apple hopes to borrow netflixs original content insight creating something no one else has to attract users to the platform. though this makes sense and has worked to great effect with video streaming services vital signs  will be a fascinating case study to determine if this same principle holds true for streaming music as well. weve also seen some evidence that the video and music streaming platforms are already converging. spotify recently launched its own video feature  that incorporates short video clips from networks such as espn abc and others. and with apple music also headed deeper into video content the trend gives rise to an interesting discussion about to what extent on demand video and music platforms are likely to merge in the future. this move also contains a certain degree of inherent optionality for apple. if the series is successful apple could leverage it as the first flagship series in its oft discussed foray into tv content. however while this would arguably strengthen apples ecosystem launching a full fledged netflix competitor would represent a historic business model shift for a company that for decades has focused on selling high margin hardware. so while vital signs  presents a number of interesting strategic opportunities for the worlds largest tech company it will probably be used first and foremost as a tool to help aid the ongoing expansion of apple music. the next billion dollar isecret

disaster. theres   very slow growth. . . its helped to tank the stock frankly. patriarch equity ceo eric schifferapple  ceo tim cook has a pretty thankless job. after taking the reins from larger than life predecessor steve jobs cook continued to grow the companys market cap from 00NUMBER00 billion in mid 00NUMBER00 to nearly 00NUMBER00 billion today. all the while cook continued to face the scrutiny of whether jobs would have approved of his direction and leadership. now the company is firmly in correction territory. analysts have increasingly turned critical on the company with a few even turning to ad hominem attacks  to express frustration. as such its important for long term investors to put bearish commentary in context. on the heels of apple pays movement into the important chinese market is schiffer as quoted at the top of this article from a feb. 00NUMBER00 cnbc interview correct that apple pay has had a hand in tanking the stockapple pay was never meant to be a significant profit driver on its own    with widely covered large cap stocks like apple a stock drop typically occurs when the company underperforms versus analyst expectations. the issue i have with schiffers analysis is that no analyst looked toward apple pay as a significant growth driver on its own. emarketer estimates that the mobile payments market will boast 00NUMBER00 billion in transactions  in 00NUMBER00 at apples transaction rate 00NUMBER00 this would net the company 00NUMBER00 million in revenue if it captured every single transaction which wouldnt be a whole lot for apple whose fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 reveneu came in at 00NUMBER00 billion. competitors samsung  pay and alphabet  pay dont even charge for their mobile payments systems essentially viewing the service as a loss leader. in a bid to further differentiate from the others samsung pay has even incorporated technology into the device that allows samsung pay enabled phones to communicate with older model pay terminals without near field communication or nfc functionality. why would a company spend time and money on research and development on new technology when the results will not appear on the top line its all about the ecosystem. mobile payments are simply an ecosystem builder    for a company such as apple where the top line was 00NUMBER00 last fiscal year 00NUMBER00 million would amount to less than two tenths of one percent of revenue. as a favorable hypothetical even if apple booked this full amount as profit the figure jumps to eight tenths of one percent of net income. tim cook has started to emphasize the tremendous software and services opportunity having 00NUMBER00 billion active devices present but its unlikely cook thinks apple pay will be a large revenue driver in the short term. instead apple pay appears to be an ecosystem builder first with a minor monetization component. the reason why  apple stock  has underperformed has nothing to do with apple pay but is due more to the fact that the companys signature product the iphone is now slowing. last quarter the iphone was responsible for 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue haul   but only grew 00NUMBER00 on a year on year basis. schiffer may be correct in his assertion that transaction growth has slowed but on both a revenue and ecosystem basis the company is not depending on apple pay to perform the heavy lifting. . . or to even have an effect on the investment thesis. to pretend otherwise is either hyperbole or a fundamental misunderstanding of apple. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds

that activist investor carl icahn had cut his stake in apple  by quite a bit. according to sec filings icahn sold off 00NUMBER00 shares of the mac maker bringing his position down 00NUMBER00 million shares. over the past couple of years icahn has been one of the most vocal and high profile investors to support apple. what givesthere were two critical flaws in icahns analysis    the billionaire made plenty of waves when he first proclaimed that apple was essentially selling at  half price   a couple years ago. at the time he assigned a current valuation of 00NUMBER00 per share. he followed up a few months later with 00NUMBER00 per share  valuation. these valuations 00NUMBER00 month price targets. rather they were what icahn believed apple was worth at the time. but the problem with these estimates were that they essentially assigned a market multiple to apple assuming that investors would realize that apple shouldnt trade at a substantial discount to the sp 00NUMBER00 the market would correct this inefficiency. it hasnt. more important it doesnt appear that the market is willing to assign a higher valuation to apple in the short term. if this persists as it has for years apples bargain discount actually isnt an opportunity  for investors. on top of that icahn and his team were modeling for apple to launch a full blown tv set in the near term. they even went as far as to predict that this business would grow to 00NUMBER00 billion  in revenue by fiscal 00NUMBER00. that projection also included 00NUMBER00 tv sets in fiscal 00NUMBER00. well apple just kicked off its fiscal 00NUMBER00 and theres still no indication that it will ever actually launch a tv set. furthermore numerous leaks have suggested that apple officially killed its tv set project. perhaps it was these two flaws in his analysis that culminated in the decision to trim his stake. or maybe this is a macro move    alternatively its possible that icahn is simply reducing his exposure to equities. throughout 00NUMBER00 he expressed his belief on several occasions that the market was overvalued and even tossed around the dreaded bubble phrase a couple of times. icahn also warned of a dramatic pullback last summer as well for instance. the activist also warned that the ongoing low interest rate environment would have dire consequences as well saying the fed may not understand the treacherous path they are going down. these are all potentially contributing factors to why icahn may have sold off a meaningful portion of his apple position. however icahns long exposure to u. s. equities increased   during the quarter in dollar terms. maybe it was a sector rotation as the tech sector tends to take it hardest during market downturns due to a large number of high multiple stocksat the end of the day its tough to figure out why icahn would sell a stock that hes touted so aggressively for years. to be clear apple remains a very large portion of his overall portfolio so its also possible that icahn was simply diversifying for diversifications sake which is never a bad idea. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think

pushing merchants to help grow the infrastructure of nfc enabled payment terminals while simultaneously partnering with financial institutions and card networks around the world. apple pay just launched in china last week. too bad apple pay seems to be hitting a wall. adoption and usage are both heading lower    earlier this month market researcher first annapolis released the results of a survey n 00NUMBER00 regarding apple pay adoption. the survey showed that awareness of apple pay remains high with 00NUMBER00 of respondents being familiar with the mobile payment service. of the iphone 00NUMBER00 owner subset 00NUMBER00 had used the service at least once technically making them adopters. of the adopters roughly 00NUMBER00 said that they use it regularly more than once per month. the bad news is that most of those relevant adoption and usage statistics are down from a year ago. the numbers are heading the wrong way. apple pay only helps    while apple pay is an important part of apples broader services ecosystem its by no means a critical piece of the puzzle. of course the company would like to boost adoption and its done an incredible job at putting together a seamless payment experience thats highly secure. but at the end of the day apple pay is still only marginally better than the current model of swiping a card which has always been the high hurdle for any mobile payment service. the only extent to which apple pay truly matters is if it helps or hurts iphone sales. its safe to say that it cannot hurt sales since there is no negative impact of including apple pay. there is only potential upside and apple pay does deliver value to those who use it. apple music is more promising than apple pay    compare apple pay to another important apple service apple music. apple music is directly monetized through consumers that subscribe for the service for 00NUMBER00 individual plan to 00NUMBER00 plan per month. its been reported that apple 00NUMBER00 on all apple pay transactions which helps to sustain the service and give it favorable economics compared to rival mobile payment services. in order for apple to earn just 00NUMBER00 per month at that take rate a user has to process 00NUMBER00 through apple pay in a given month. given current limitations in infrastructure support and availability thats a pretty high bar to meaningfully compare to apple music. it goes without saying that apple pay and apple music are not mutually exclusive nor do they compete. they clearly complement each other within the ecosystem but the point is that apple music is much more likely to be financially significant than apple pay. overall apples services segment is now a 00NUMBER00 billion business. the more the merrier. the next

brought in about 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue and just over 00NUMBER00 billion in operating income last quarter. this is certainly a lot of revenue and operating income but whats curious is that sales actually declined  year over year in this hugely important market. the drop wasnt large on the order of 00NUMBER00 but it does suggest tepid customer response to the companys latest generation iphones. indeed evidence suggests that apple may actually be losing share  to competitors that build devices based on the android operating system such as samsung. apple appears to be trying to reinvigorate iphone sales growth in the united states through two initiatives. lets take a closer look at them. trade up with installments    the first is apples new trade up with installments plan. the premise around this is simple trade in an old smartphone apple emphasizes old iphones but says that customers can trade in eligible android devices as well and get a new device at a modest monthly rate. in theory this should make it easier and affordable for customers with older generation iphones to purchase newer models. theres nothing fundamentally novel here people have always been able to sell older devices and use the proceeds to fund purchases of newer ones. the main benefit to this program is that it makes the process of getting value for the older device and applying it to the newer one very easy. although this sounds nice it remains to be seen whether it will be effective. after all the iphone upgrade program sounded great too but that didnt stop iphone sales from dipping in the americas year over year. rewards program for retail 00NUMBER00 mark gurman recently reported that apple has initiated something of a sales contest for retail employees that will be in effect from feb. 00NUMBER00 to march 00NUMBER00. gurman says that this new program is designed to incentivize retail employees to sell more iphones and iphone accessories. per the report the best performing stores judged by a number of metrics during the aforementioned time interval will win gear from apples corporate gift shop in cupertino in addition to a storewide party. the best performing people in each market gurman says will win all expense paid trips to cupertino california. these are nice but wont solve apples fundamental problem    new trade in programs are nice and giving retail employees incentives to work really  hard to push iphones might help a little bit but it wont solve the fundamental demand problem that the company seems to be facing in the us. ceo tim cook cited macroeconomiccurrency headwinds as negatively impacting both revenue and potentially demand but those excuses dont seem to carry much weight in a region like the u. s. i think apple is facing a combination of market saturation as well as potential market share loss in this country. the former cant be helped by newbetter products but the latter certainly can. if apple is able to deliver something truly awesome with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then theres a reasonable chance that the company can start gaining market segment share against its fierce competition in the u. s. americas. it would seem though that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus simply werent enough. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to

galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge at a pre mobile world congress event. the device is widely viewed as incremental serving up solid but hardly groundbreaking enhancements. the 00NUMBER00 phones have improved rear facing and front facing cameras faster processor more system ram support for a microsd expansion slot giving up on trying to up sell to higher storage capacities a la apple   and so on. theyre a pair of really solid high end android devices. the question though that apple investors might read should   be asking themselves is this will the samsung galaxy 00NUMBER00 have a material negative impact on demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plusit seems possible    when the full reviews of the 00NUMBER00 edge come in i believe that the findings vis a vis the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will be the followingthe samsung phones pack substantially better both sharper and better image quality displays. the samsung phones are able to fit more screen into a smaller physical footprint thanks to much narrower bezels. the samsung phones have much better cameras. apple will of course have the advantage of running ios and it will have 00NUMBER00 touch but 00NUMBER00 touch has not proven to be the inevitable feature for most people that the idevice maker had hoped it would be. i think those reviews if they come out and say what i think theyre going to say could very well serve to steer customers away from apples iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which are already suffering from tepid demand in the marketplace toward samsungs flagships. what apple needs to do to respond    frankly this is exactly why apple needs to shift away from its tick tock strategy and deliver meaningful improvements across every vector each year. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus should  have included higher quality sharper displays. apple also appears to have dropped the ball on the camera with the 00NUMBER00 with third party tests  often claiming minimal image quality improvements over the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. theres little that apple can do until it launches the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the september time frame. however when it does launch those devices it had better come out with a heck of a phone. the device needs to be so  ahead of the curve when it comes out that it can withstand whatever innovations that the likes of samsung have in store for the galaxy 00NUMBER00 which is likely to launch in the 00NUMBER00 timeframe. i have every confidence that apples chip team will deliver with the 00NUMBER00 indeed the 00NUMBER00 is in my book a superior processor to either the exynos 00NUMBER00 or the snapdragon 00NUMBER00 that power the galaxy 00NUMBER00 and i think that apple has something amazing cooking with the 00NUMBER00. its up to the rest of the teams within apple and outside of apple since apple works closely with third party suppliers to deliver. the iphone 00NUMBER00 display needs to be incredible ­   extremely sharp beautiful and  power efficient. the industrial design needs to be absolutely stunning beautiful enough so that competitors wonder why they didnt think of it before and innovative enough that actually imitating it will be difficult. the good news is that this is likely exactly what apple is cooking up given the massive increase  in its research and development budget over the last couple of years. three companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is

recent regulatory filings the fund started a new position in apple  during the fourth quarter of of 00NUMBER00 buying 00NUMBER00 million shares in the company for a market value of around 00NUMBER00 billion based on prices as of dec. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. investing professionals can make mistakes just like everyone else in fact they frequently do. this means that investors need to always do their own homework as opposed to blindly replicating the positions of others no matter how successful and prestigious. on the other hand there is nothing wrong with taking a look at what hedge funds are doing in search for investing ideas and  apple stock  looks like a compelling purchase at current prices. why apple looks undervalued    apple stock is down by nearly 00NUMBER00 from its highs of the last year and valuation looks remarkably attractive. it trades at price to earnings ratio around 00NUMBER00 a major discount versus the average company in the sp 00NUMBER00 index which carries a pe ratio near 00NUMBER00. the main reason for such a pessimistic valuation is that growth is slowing down. apple reported 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year 00NUMBER00 an increase of only 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 billion in the same quarter during the prior year. most of this weakness was due to foreign currency fluctuations since sales in constant currency grew by a much stronger 00NUMBER00. however the fact remains that growth is clearly decelerating. for the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 meaning the quarter ending in march 00NUMBER00 management is expecting revenue to be in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. this would represent a decline of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 versus 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue during quarter ended in march 00NUMBER00. if sales numbers turn out the be in line with guidance this will be the first time in more than a decade that apple reports declining revenue figures and this is arguably the biggest reason for all the negativity currently weighting on apple stock. is this an opportunity for investors    apple makes almost 00NUMBER00 of revenue from the iphone and the smartphone industry is maturing. this has negative implications when it comes to growth potential for different players in the industry so the years of explosive expansion are most probably in the past for apple. the company is also going through a very particular phase. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was a booming success for apple in 00NUMBER00. since many consumers were eagerly awaiting an iphone model with a larger screen sales were exceptionally high for this product. as a reference apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones last quarter  thats up by nearly 00NUMBER00 from unit sales during the same quarter two years ago. even if growth is slowing down sales volume are nothing short of gargantuan. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is no game changer in comparison to the 00NUMBER00 so year over year comparisons will probably remain challenging in the coming quarters. nevertheless apple customers are remarkably loyal to the brand and nearly 00NUMBER00 of iphone users have not upgraded to the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00 yet. according to a survey by gallup 00NUMBER00 of iphone users in the u. s. upgrade their smartphones as soon as the carrier company allows them to do so usually every two years. this means growth should improve due to model renewals over the coming years. there are over 00NUMBER00 billion active apple devices in circulation nowadays. this is a major positive for the company in terms of both hardware renewal sales in the future and opportunities in areas like software and services. apple reported a big increase of 00NUMBER00 in sales from the services segment last quarter. this division still accounts for a modest 00NUMBER00 of total revenue but chances are that it will continue to outgrow other segments and make stronger contributions to overall revenue growth in the years ahead. the main idea is that apple is priced for undemanding expectations due to fears about slowing growth in the coming quarter but the companys long term future does not look as dismal as current valuation indicates. the recent decline in apple stock looks like a buying opportunity for long term investors so tiger global seems to be making a smart decision.

apple   which has seen sales of its ipad line of tablet computers plunge over the last two years didnt roll out an update to its mainstream ipad air family of devices. instead the company introduced customers to the ipad pro a 00NUMBER00 inch monster of a tablet with an optional apple pencil accessory as well as a long overdue update to its ipad mini line. at first i thought that apple had been holding off on releasing the new air to give its new ipad pro product its time in the spotlight. however after reading an excellent profile of apple chip chief johnny srouji in bloomberg business     its become quite clear that the reason that we didnt get an ipad air 00NUMBER00 last fall was that it simply wasnt ready nor was it intended to be ready in that time. did you know that the ipad pro was delayed    bloomberg business reports the ipad pro was originally scheduled to launch in the spring of 00NUMBER00 packing the same 00NUMBER00 that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 launched in the previous fall did. however apparently as a result of the fact that numerous aspects of the device were not ready to support a spring 00NUMBER00 the device was pushed out to last fall. in order to deliver a satisfactory amount of performance the 00NUMBER00 chip inside of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is faster than 00NUMBER00 inside of the ipad air 00NUMBER00 apples chip teams reportedly had to pull in the development of the 00NUMBER00 processor by about six months. what does this have to do with the ipad air 00NUMBER00 clear that apple had expected the ipad pro to in concert with the ipad air 00NUMBER00 hold the line for the ipad product family for calendar 00NUMBER00. presumably apple had hoped to roll out perhaps an ipad pro 00NUMBER00 as well as the ipad air 00NUMBER00 in march of this year. this means that apple had probably planned on getting the ipad air 00NUMBER00 out in early 00NUMBER00 all along hoping that the ipad pro and the ipad air 00NUMBER00 would be enough to keep customers interested in ipad throughout the entirety of calendar. in other words the development schedules of all of the new components and software innovations that apple intends to bring out with the ipad air 00NUMBER00 were targeting early 00NUMBER00 rather than late 00NUMBER00. such a release cadence actually makes sense. in the fall apple would launch its blockbuster flagship iphones and in order to stay in the headlines and give customers even more reason to hand their money over to apple roll out ipads and a smaller iphone in the spring. the future for ipad and some thoughts on the mac    indeed i expect that the next time apple rolls out new ipads after the rumored launch this march will be march 00NUMBER00. id expect to see both an 00NUMBER00 powered ipad air 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 powered ipad pro 00NUMBER00. an 00NUMBER00 powered ipad mini 00NUMBER00 could also make it out next spring alongside the two larger devices. in addition with iphone grabbing the spotlight in the fall and ipad starring in the spring i expect that future mac product refreshes at least portable macs will come targeted mainly in the summerback to school season. this way apple allows for each of its product categories time to shine and perhaps more importantly stays in investors minds year round. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are

galaxy 00NUMBER00 would pack functionality similar to 00NUMBER00 touch first introduced in a mass market smartphone by apple. the reported cited sources familiar with the matter. it would seem however that those sources were not so well informed. on feb. 00NUMBER00 samsung formally unveiled the galaxy 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge. the phones include a host of under the hood improvements but one feature that was conspicuously absent was a samsung designed clone of apples 00NUMBER00 touch. although samsung may have excluded this technology for cost reasons after all the companys phones tend to be sold at discounts not too long after launch i suspect that apples song and dance about the difficulty of implementing this technology may indeed have merit. what apple has said about the technology    in an interview with bloomberg apple chief design officer jony ive said that 00NUMBER00 touch is a technology that the company worked on for a long time multi multi years. phil schiller apples marketing chief told bloomberg that the hardware to build a display that does what 00NUMBER00 touch does is unbelievably hard. two top tier flagships launched at mwc 00NUMBER00 dont have it    to date i am not aware of any major android flagship phones that feature functionality equivalent to what apple dubs 00NUMBER00. chinese smartphone vendor huawei actually tried to upstage apple by showing off a variant of its mate s smartphone implementing what it calls force touch. now although headlines following this demonstration included things such ashuawei brings force touch to its phones before apple the verge andhuawei beats apple to force touch on phonesthe fine print that these headlines didnt emphasize is that the force touch functionality would be limited to a single halo model sold in select regions. its not even clear whether such devices ever actually made it into the hands of paying customers. samsungs new flagships dont have the feature nor does lgs freshly announced flagship the lg 00NUMBER00. those are likely to be the two most well known flagship devices from two quite prominent mobile competitors in a very fierce market for flagship android devices. if they couldnt get this technology implemented into their latest flagships which are launching about six months after  apple launched the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then it would seem that there may indeed be something to apples bold claims of technical difficulty. apples just getting started    apples vast success in cornering the premium portion of the smartphone market should allow it to invest substantially in new potentially game changing technologies. indeed its rd budget has skyrocketed to a nearly 00NUMBER00 billionyear run rate. and given its focus on a fairly narrow set of products each of its product lines particularly iphone should enjoy all of the benefits that come with a virtually limitless budget. i believe that 00NUMBER00 touch merely represents the beginning of what is likely to be a very robust pipeline of innovations from the idevice maker. there are some areas in which competitors still lead apples iphone 00NUMBER00 plus displays are not class leading nor are the phones camera subsystems but over time i expect that apple will close the gaps where needed and continue to innovate in terms of new technologies and user experiences in ways that its competitors may eventually be unable to match. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. image credit apple. readers of my columns know that for quite some time ive been publishing my predictions about apple  s iphone 00NUMBER00. much to my surprise as i followed anandtech  s coverage of the chinese smartphone vendors new flagship the 00NUMBER00 it was pretty stunning to see that this new device which is priced far more cheaply than even the cheapest iphone 00NUMBER00 had many of the characteristics that i expect apple to bring to market with the iphone 00NUMBER00. to put it bluntly the 00NUMBER00 seems to be about a generation ahead of the iphone 00NUMBER00 in almost every way. lets take a closer look. borderless wide color gamut display    the 00NUMBER00 features a 00NUMBER00 inch 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 resolution display meaning that it already has a far sharper display than what the iphone 00NUMBER00 packs. whats really interesting though is that there is practically no bezel on the device something that i have been expecting from the iphone 00NUMBER00. additionally the display on the 00NUMBER00 display covers 00NUMBER00 of the ntsc color gamut the iphone in contrast covers just 00NUMBER00 ntsc. furthermore it is apparently able to dynamically adjust the contrast ratio of each individual pixel based on the lighting conditions for greater screen clarity in bright conditions. so the 00NUMBER00 has a sharper more vivid and frankly more sophisticated display than the ones included on either the iphone 00NUMBER00 or the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. lighter than the iphone 00NUMBER00 but packing a much larger battery    the 00NUMBER00 weighs just 00NUMBER00 grams 00NUMBER00 grams lighter than the iphone 00NUMBER00 per xiaomi. despite being lighter it has a substantially larger battery. the 00NUMBER00 battery has a capacity of 00NUMBER00 mah compared to the 00NUMBER00 mah one found inside of the iphone 00NUMBER00. no 00NUMBER00 touch clone though    although xiaomi now has the better display apple still has 00NUMBER00 functionality which includes the so called taptic engine to call its own. however given that 00NUMBER00 touch hasnt really caught on and become the inevitable feature that apple had hoped it would be its not clear if that trumps the better display larger battery and lighter build of the 00NUMBER00. expect apple to see market share drop in china until iphone 00NUMBER00 is released    apples sales in china have cooled in recent quarters and i suspect that with phones like the 00NUMBER00 out there embarrassing the iphone 00NUMBER00 in a number of key metrics at a substantially lower price the pressure will only intensify for the idevice maker. indeed i expect apple to lose market segment share in china during the next few quarters. apple needs a real winner with the iphone 00NUMBER00. at the very least the company needs to catch up to what its competition seems to be doing but i dont think that will be enough. apples iphone 00NUMBER00 will spend half of its life contending with what these android smartphone makers have coming next. frankly im surprised and saddened to see apple drop the ball like this. the company has virtually unlimited resources at its disposal which should allow it to put out products that are unequivocally best in class. not only that but its products should remain  best in class throughout their life cycles. if apple for all of its resources cant put out a phone that remains worthy of its premium price tag for a full year then somebody at apple isnt doing his or her job properly. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when

unlock has been the talk surrounding apple inc. aapl    lately with  apple stock  being a big underperformer to the overall market. since the recent feb. 00NUMBER00 low of both apple and the sp 00NUMBER00 shares of aapl have risen only 00NUMBER00 compared to a gain of 00NUMBER00 the sp 00NUMBER00. apple stock is also trading near the cheapest level compared to the sp 00NUMBER00 over the past year as the chart below highlights. it is also interesting to note that at current levels aapl has a dividend yield of 00NUMBER00 easily eclipsing the 00NUMBER00 year u. s. treasury yield of 00NUMBER00. some may also argue that apples credit rating should be higher than that of the u. s. government given the onerous debt burden of the u. s. with a cash hoard of 00NUMBER00 billion   the apple dividend is most assuredly on safe ground. the current yield on apple bonds maturing in 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 only 00NUMBER00 points more than the yield on the stock. this combination of comparatively cheap stock with a solid above market dividend yield sets up nicely in my opinion for a put sale trade looking to be a buyer of apple stock at a discount to the current price. by selling puts an investor will receive the put premium now in exchange for being obligated to buy apple stock at the strike price sold. specifically i would look to sell the aapl january 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 net credit. while i normally trade shorter term options this is more of an investment type trade which is better suited to a longer time frame. the maximum gain on this trade is 00NUMBER00 per each put sold. each put sold represents an obligation to buy 00NUMBER00 shares of apple stock at 00NUMBER00 per share should aapl close below the 00NUMBER00 level on january expiration. the net cost basis on the stock would 00NUMBER00 which is the strike price of 00NUMBER00 less the 00NUMBER00 premium initially received. the net cost of 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 below the 00NUMBER00 thursday closing price of apple stock providing a very robust downside cushion. return on risk is 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 annualized. assuming apple maintains its current dividend of 00NUMBER00 cents per quarter the net cost of 00NUMBER00 equates to a 00NUMBER00 apple dividend yield. this is a leave alone trade until expiration with either the puts expiring worthless and you keeping the premium is apple stock if 00NUMBER00 or above or you buying 00NUMBER00 shares of apple stock at a net cost of 00NUMBER00 if apple is below 00NUMBER00. for investors looking to capture a 00NUMBER00 return and who are comfortable owning apple stock at a 00NUMBER00 discount selling some out of the money puts may be worth considering. as of this writing tim biggam did not hold a position in any of the

of nasdaq inc.  smartwatches have taken a lot of flack since they first debuted and there are legitimate reasons for this. the devices are too dependent on smartphones still many arent very stylish some have poor battery life and many consumers still wonder what problem smartwatches are supposed to to fix. but with all of their drawbacks smartwatches are are still chugging along. global shipments of the devices just surpassed swiss watches at the end of 00NUMBER00. according to strategy analytics 00NUMBER00 million smartwatches were shipped in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 compared to 00NUMBER00 million swiss watches. thats the first time smartwatches have outpaced swiss watch shipments even if it wasnt by all that much. there are two notable things within the data. the first is that there is significant demand for smartwatches as a replacement for a former technology traditional watches despite the segment being very new and still a bit confusing for consumers. second apple owns the smartwatch market. we already knew this  from last years canalys data but its still good to see new data from an additional source confirm it. apple held 00NUMBER00 of smartwatch shipment market share in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 while its closest competitor samsung had just 00NUMBER00. all together apple and samsung accounted for 00NUMBER00 out of every 00NUMBER00 smartwatches shipped at the end of 00NUMBER00. heres what strategy analytics has to say about that the swiss watch industry has been sticking its head in the sand and hoping smartwatches will go away. swiss brands like tag heuer accounted for a tiny 00NUMBER00 percent of all smartwatches shipped globally during 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and they are long way behind apple samsung and other leaders in the high growth smartwatch category. things can only go up from here less than a year after entering the smartwatch market apple is easily outpacing samsung which entered several years ago. whats interesting about this is that right now there is no close competitor for apple in the smartwatch market. fitbit still dominates the wearable space with its line of fitness trackers and a few smartwatches but that lead likely wont hold up for much longer. apple is expected to overtake fitbit in wearable shipments soon according to idc. fitbit is attempting to take on the apple watch with its new blaze smartwatch but the device doesnt come close to the apple watchs functionality apps or design. the question right now for apple investors isnt whether the company can dominate the smartwatch market but how long it can keep its lead. more and more tech companies are jumping into the wearable tech space and could cut into some of apples smartwatch shipments. to fend them off apple will need to innovate quickly with the apple watch adding one or two significant feature improvements each year. of course the companys been doing that for years with the iphone but wearables are a different ballgame. theres less space for new hardware less screen space and the software needs to be simpler than on a smartphone. well get a better idea as to how well apples executed on its smartwatch strategy with the next version of the apple watch. but for now the company is expected to maintain its smartwatch market share lead until at least 00NUMBER00. the next step for apple will be to expand from just dominating market share to convincing the 00NUMBER00 of u. s. consumers who dont own smartwatches to buy them. but for now the company should be satisfied that its leading the pack in the smartwatch segment and starting to outpace swiss watches at the same time. the next billion dollar isecret  the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the article well that was fast smartwaches are now more popular than swiss watches originally appeared on foolcom. copyright © 00NUMBER00

apples ipad business certainly has seen better days. apple has been widely expected to unveil an ipad air 00NUMBER00 at its rumored march event alongside a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00. that would update the 00NUMBER00 inch model after apple chose not to give the ipad air 00NUMBER00 any love last fall. however there is one notable change that were now hearing about. 00NUMBER00 mark gurman is now reporting that apples next 00NUMBER00 inch ipad wont be called the ipad air 00NUMBER00 at all. itll be an ipad pro instead apple is now reportedly going to release its new 00NUMBER00 inch tablet as part of the ipad pro family expanding the pro moniker. this smaller pro model will use a similar 00NUMBER00 processor include more ram like the 00NUMBER00 inch model and adopt the same four speaker stereo audio system. significantly the device will feature an updated display that can support apple pencil. the new tablet is also said to support apples smart keyboard which implies that apple has a smaller version of its keyboard cover ready too. the good news is that apple is not expected to change pricing at all. apple has stood pat by the 00NUMBER00 starting price for years. simple is better unlike what apple seems to be doing with iphone branding making it needlessly complicated this move makes a lot of sense since it would simplify the ipad branding. instead of having three distinct families for mini air and pro this would consolidate the two more expensive products under the pro umbrella. apple could also justify this by saying only pro models have stylus support for apple pencil which apple hopes will appeal to creative professionals. the current ipad airs may still be sold at lower price points but it looks as if they would eventually be phased out in favor of just the mini and pro. apple pencil has been one of the most interesting new features of ipad pro even if the company was mostly following in the footsteps of rivals. curiously you might think that apple would keep apple pencil support limited to the most expensive 00NUMBER00 inch pro in order to drive unit sales and boost average selling prices which have been declining for years following the introduction of the cheaper mini lineup but at the same time even the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad could use a sales uplift and broader apple pencil support could contribute. data source sec filings. calendar

policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  thanks to good work 00NUMBER00 mark gurman the investment community is well aware of apple  s plan to host an event on march 00NUMBER00. during this event the idevice maker is said to be preparing to unveil three things. the first is a new ipad the ipad air 00NUMBER00. the next is a set of new watchbands for the apple watch. and finally the company is said to introduce an updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone dubbed the iphone 00NUMBER00. the device is said to look like an iphone 00NUMBER00 the cameras of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the processing power of the iphone 00NUMBER00. frankly im a tad surprised that apple is bothering to host an event at all. heres why. watch bands small iphone    unless apple plans to launch a next generation apple watch at this event viewers are unlikely to care all that much about what the idevice maker has to say. new apple watch bands are nice and all but theyre hardly the sort of thing that either customers or investors get excited about. then we have the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone. it should be a nice device but i seriously doubt that anything about it will be anything groundbreaking since it is said to recycle components from both the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus as well as the iphone 00NUMBER00. the ipad air 00NUMBER00 should be the star of the show    the ipad air 00NUMBER00 has the potential to really make this event worthwhile. although the 00NUMBER00 chip that the device is said to pack has already made its debut in the ipad pro i strongly suspect that the rest of the technologies that the product is said to bring will be quite new. for example one rumor suggests that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will have a 00NUMBER00 display which should mean that the device will be the sharpest display ever shipped on in an ipad. i also wouldnt be surprised to see innovations that made their debut in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus such as the second generation touch id make it to the new ipad as well. however if the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is really going to be the product that carries apples march product launch event itll likely need more than the 00NUMBER00 chip and a sharper screen to really be worthwhile. heres why apple is probably bothering with an event    if the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus had sold in the numbers that apple had actually hoped they were likely banking on year over year growth i dont think the idevice maker would be hosting an event to launch these products they very well may have shown up accompanied by a press release. however at this point apple likely recognizes that it needs to be in the limelight as often as possible to both drum up hype for its product offerings and to in an indirect fashion communicate with investors. it will be interesting to see what apple executives have to say at the event. can they drum up interest in iphone and ipad with the new releases will they be able to appease investors that have had to deal with disappointing iphone sales and the resultant drop in the share price over the last several monthswell find out in a couple of weeks.

views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple  will hold an event on march 00NUMBER00 according to a range of different media outlets with reliable track records for apple rumors. at the event the company will unveil a new iphone and ipad as well as introduce more apple watch bands according 00NUMBER00. with iphones representing the lions share of apples revenue and earnings the potential of an early iphone launch is arguably the most intriguing narrative for the rumored event  at least to investors. heres everything there is to know about apples potential new iphone. iphone 00NUMBER00. the rumored new iphone is expected to look similar to the iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. apples new iphone   perhaps the most important thing for investors to know about the rumored iphone is that its not expected to be a flagship device. instead the new iphone will reportedly aim to simply beef up its two year old iphone the iphone 00NUMBER00 with an improved version at the same price point. like the iphone 00NUMBER00 the new smartphone is expected to have 00NUMBER00 inch display. this would be much smaller than apples current flagship lineup. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have display sizes of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 inches respectively. iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 both have a 00NUMBER00 inch display. image source apple. rumored to sport the name iphone 00NUMBER00 with the e possibly standing for enhanced the latest rumors on the device suggest the new phone is essentially the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 significant internal hardware and software 00NUMBER00 mark gurman a 00NUMBER00 author with a reliable track record with apple rumors. this assertion differs from earlier rumors that the new phone would look like a smaller version of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 which have more curved edges than the iphone 00NUMBER00. the internals are reportedly significantly better than the iphone 00NUMBER00 with potential specs including the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 chips from the iphone 00NUMBER00 an nfc chip for apple pay the ability to take live photos and 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb options instead of the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 gb options for the iphone 00NUMBER00. if rumors are correct the device will have a starting price of 00NUMBER00 without a contract 00NUMBER00 less than the starting price for apples iphone 00NUMBER00. a march iphone launch would be completely out of the ordinary for the tech giant. typically apple introduces new iphones once a year. and if apple introduces a phone in march and keeps to its typical flagship iphone announcement in september this would mean two iphone launches in the same year. even when apple decided to introduce a lower cost model  the iphone 00NUMBER00 priced below its flagship iphone model which was the iphone 00NUMBER00 at the time the company introduced both models simultaneously in the fall the same period apple normally introduces its latest iphones. why a new iphone is important    but a mid cycle iphone launch makes sense after considering two reasons apple might choose to do so. first apple expects its second quarter revenue to decline about 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter driven by an expected decline in iphone sales as the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have a tough time living up to the huge success of their predecessors. so a mid cycle iphone launch could help beef up apples current lineup and potentially help it return to growth. second priced lower than flagship phones a revamped lower cost iphone could boost sales in fast growing markets where price is more important markets like china and india. while investors should keep in mind that reports of a smaller mid cycle iphone are still only rumors at this point it does make sense that apple would launch the device. a secret billion dollar stock

payment system known as apple pay. unsurprisingly with the launch of its own 00NUMBER00 smartphones apple rival samsung  released its own very creatively named mobile payment system known as samsung pay. also it would seem that apple pay is utterly crushing samsung pay. billions vs. just hundreds of millions    samsung recently bragged that its samsung pay service is now up to 00NUMBER00 million users and they have spent over 00NUMBER00 million over the last six months. in sharp contrast to this apple ceo tim cook recently said on the companys january earnings call that customers have spent billions of dollars with apple pay. furthermore cook said that during the second half of 00NUMBER00 the idevice maker saw a significant acceleration in usage claiming that the rate of growth during the second half 00NUMBER00 times  greater than that in the first half of the year. note that these results were recorded before  apple introduced apple pay to the china market earlier this month. samsung too plans to roll out samsung pay in china next month but i have a strong suspicion that apple pays growth will only continue to wildly outpace that of samsung pay in the coming months and years. why is samsung even bothering    according to one analyst cited in a wall street journal  column samsung is trying to build out its software and services in order to lock customers in to the samsung ecosystemhowever in my view this is an exercise in futility. other android based devices are able to implement android pay. the barriers to actually moving from using samsung pay to android pay are virtually nonexistent from the perspective of the consumer so its hard to buy the samsung wants to build its own walled garden argument here. samsungs gig just isnt in software and services    samsung builds nice android phones packed with generally top of the line specifications. thanks to aggressive marketing the company is arguably the best known alternative to apple in the premium portion of the market. samsungs strengths have been and continue to be its ability to design and manufacture the components that go into mobile devices it manufactures many of the chips that go into its phones and is increasingly building the chips that go into its competitors phones too. ditto dram nand flash image sensors and displays. indeed samsung has been more aggressive recently about its components business focusing on trying to win major chip foundry contracts supplying displays and memory to direct competitors and so on. software and services just really isnt just samsungs strength and although the company can throw tons of money at the problem im not convinced that this would lead to the fundamental companywide changes needed to really become a software and services focused company. at the end of the day i believe that apple will continue to aggressively roll out apple pay worldwide doing the necessary work to make sure that this service is an integral part of the iphone ownership experience. samsung will continue to try too but it will like so many of the other features that it has introduced in its flagship devices over the years merely be a gimmicky selling point so that it too can say that it has its own mobile payment service. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  a report from digitimes some time ago suggested that apple  s next generation ipad air known as the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will feature a display with a 00NUMBER00 resolution panel. some believe that this report isnt accurate as a 00NUMBER00 resolution panel on the ipad air 00NUMBER00 would result in a display with substantially greater pixel density than even the display on the recently launched ipad pro. i submit that this argument doesnt really hold up. heres why. the ipad mini has a sharper display than the air. . . the ipad mini which is a smaller and cheaper device than the ipad air packs a display with the same exact resolution as the ipad air 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00. that means the ipad minis display features a pixel density of 00NUMBER00 pixels per inch noticeably greater than that of the ipad air or the ipad pro both of which come in at just 00NUMBER00 pixels per inch. so just going by historical precedent theres nothing here that suggests that apples larger devices must have higher pixel density and thus sharper displays than their smaller cheaper counterparts. the ipad pro is actually pretty old    the ipad pro was originally supposed to launch  in the spring of 00NUMBER00 according to an article published by bloomberg business and was delayed because elements of the hardware software and accompanying stylus werent ready in time for a spring launch. that means that everything about it save for perhaps the 00NUMBER00 chip that was pulled into the device and i suspect that apple just used the ipad air 00NUMBER00 motherboard for the ipad pro was designed around a spring 00NUMBER00 launch. the ipad air 00NUMBER00 on the other hand is a device that was apparently scheduled to launch in the spring of 00NUMBER00 this whole time. this means that the company and its suppliers had the luxury of extra development time to get the technologies including the display just right for the launch. hey a sharper display is a cool selling point    apples ipad faces a couple of issues in the marketplace. on one hand larger screen phones are eating away at the traditional tablet market. to convince owners of large screen phones that theres value in owning an even larger screen tablet apple needs to include some interesting new features. in addition to the competition that ipad faces from the iphone apple faces competition from the ipads it sold people in prior years. many people view their older ipads as good enough so the improvements apple brings to newer devices need to be so compelling that even if people dont upgrade out of need   theyll upgrade out of want  for a dramatically better device. apple is trying but dont count on ipad to be a growth superstar    i believe that apple will do a phenomenal job with the ipad 00NUMBER00 it should be a substantial upgrade from the ipad air 00NUMBER00 and for ipad enthusiasts id imagine itll be something of a no brainer buy. unfortunately for apple most people arent ipad enthusiasts. at some point ipad sales have to bottom out and i believe theyll bottom out at a point well above zero particularly as users holding on to older ipads eventually upgrade. when those people so apple looks like itll be ready to serve them with solid products. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

expanded its high end phablet offerings by introducing the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge last year. that appears to be a smart move. source samsung. according to adobe  digital index or adi mobile usage is exploding. according to the report compiled from aggregated data from more than 00NUMBER00 the top seven countries in emea an acronym meaning europe middle east and asia saw at least 00NUMBER00 growth year over year yoy in mobile visits. but despite that growth in mobile tablet traffic specifically is decreasing. the information regarding a shift to mobile is pretty impressive and should be watched among advertisers. but for device manufacturers with all due respect to adobe theres nothing groundbreaking in this data. a semi thorough look through apple  s device sales figures would tell you the tablet market has struggled while the iphone market has powered higher in wake of a larger screen. screen expansion tablet sales compression    when the initial ipad was unveiled in 00NUMBER00 the current generation iphone was the iphone 00NUMBER00. the differences between the 00NUMBER00 inch first gen ipad and the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone was pretty large and both devices were packaged as distinct products. the introduction of the iphone 00NUMBER00 pushed the screen to four inches followed by the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus increase to 00NUMBER00 inches and 00NUMBER00 inches respectively. the newest gen ipad air 00NUMBER00 has kept its 00NUMBER00 inch screen size and apple has introduced a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad mini as well. in doing so the difference between the largest iphone and smallest ipad narrowed from 00NUMBER00 diagonal inches to a mere 00NUMBER00. the narrowing of screen sizes presents cannibalization amid device redundancy. according to adis principal tamara gaffney now instead of buying both a smartphone and a tablet people are opting for phablets and relying on this one device. apples unit shipments seems to confirm this is taking place with its ipad model. source apples annual report. unit figures in millions. in last years second fiscal quarter apple ceo tim cook addressed this on the conference call have we had cannibalization the answer is yes. later addressing apples ipad sales drop it will play out and at some point it will stabilize. i cant say exactly when but im pretty confident it will. since that quarter apples ipad

of smartphone and tablet demand in its 00NUMBER00 outlook but that may be wishful thinking in its tablet business in light of adis and idcs studies. idc brings better news for samsungs smartphone business by reporting a small 00NUMBER00 gain in shipments during 00NUMBER00. the company added a new high end phablet form factor to its offering last year by bringing the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge and its massive 00NUMBER00 inch display to market alongside the newest iteration of the companys galaxy note series. moving forward especially in the developing markets of emea it seems both companies should focus less on selling tablets and more on putting larger screen smartphones in the hands of new consumers. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

should take notice. aapl  data by ycharts. despite its admitted struggles of late ample historic evidence  suggests apple could in fact prove to be one of the most compelling buys in tech. thanks to the companys hotel california esque ecosystem and forthcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 better days almost assuredly lie ahead for apple and its investors. equally importantly the tech giant continues to delve deeper into key emerging markets like china and india as yet another recent move demonstrates. apple pay enters china    late last week apple launched its eponymous mobile payment platform apple pay in china in an attempt to further its competitive position in its second largest market by sales. the move makes china only the fifth nation to receive support for apples mobile payment service since its launch in late 00NUMBER00. and though the market opportunity is undeniably compelling apple will assuredly face an uphill battle in establishing a foothold for apple pay. image source applefirst the good news as with nearly everything else in china the sheer enormity of the market opportunity for mobile payments is simply tantalizing. according to the china internet network information center over 00NUMBER00 million users have already begun purchasing goods and services through mobile payments platforms in the prc. for those scoring at home that figure easily exceeds the entire population of the united states though it represents a mere fraction of the overall chinese populace. the bad news is that the bulk of those mobile payments occur through the countrys two dominant payment platforms tencent  s wechat payment and alibaba  s alipay. as such the jury remains decidedly out as to what degree apple pay will help expand the companys sales in the worlds largest smartphone market. but will it work   the consumer response to apple pay in china will prove fascinating to watch since china is only the second mass market  the first being the u. s. where an already thriving mobile payments environment exists. recall that apple pays purpose isnt likely to drive any kind of financial result for the company. the company reportedly charges a mere 00NUMBER00 per transaction a paltry enough sum to all but ensure it never becomes a profit center in its own right. instead so called flagship features like siri touchid and apple pay aim to achieve two primary ends. first on a device cycle basis each one of apples new flagship features serves as a key point of differentiation between apples iphone and other high end smartphones an advantage that often disappears after a device cycle or two. more broadly apple also uses these services to strengthen its ecosystem as a whole. the idea is that the more aspects of the user experience it can layer into its own app and software ecosystem the better it can hold onto consumers in the long term. while the ecosystem strength aspect of apple pay should still help it in china long term the fact that many other mobile payments avenues already exist in china will create a fascinating case study of apple pays actual appeal and the ultimate outcome is anyones guess. on one hand apples brand remains incredibly popular among chinese consumers. its high priced hardware is largely still viewed as a status symbol. banking on apples broader brand strength apple pay could enjoy a halo effect of sorts among chinese consumers. at the same time though between a weakening economy and popular pre existing competitors theres a fair case to be made that apple pay doesnt necessarily offer anything new. so while were early on in this storyline it could prove a fascinating sub plot for apple investors to watch in the months to come. the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in

apple  aapl   ceo. while the legal and technological ramifications resulting from the san bernardino iphone case will take months and years to play themselves out the business implications are already visible. one of the major questions facing apple in the post steve jobs era was how the company would be managed in such a way as to maintain its unique culture while keeping the product front and center. by remaining true to his promise regarding security and privacy tim cook continues to build his legacy of strengthening the apple experience by embracing principles and values that transcend hardware and software. the apple experiencethere have been a handful of events since 00NUMBER00 that have served as key milestones in cooks tenure as ceo. the apple maps debacle apple retail turmoil apple supply chain working conditions environmental activism and data privacy and security have each played a role in laying the groundwork for tim cooks legacy. with jony ive focused on apples product vision   tim cook has been playing to his strengths dedicating much of his attention to nurturing the apple experience by focusing on six values security and privacy trust equality and ethics and environmentally responsibility. the following diagram highlights how jony ives product vision is combined with cooks value oriented focus to create the apple experience. for each of these six values there have been specific events where cooks actions demonstrated his leadership style and vision. security and privacytim cooks long standing stance on security and privacy were thrown into the public circle last week with the u. s. department of justice getting a federal judge to order apple help them break into an iphone involved in the san bernardino terror case. cooks hard line stance against such an order should not have come as a surprise. since becoming ceo cook has embarked on an unwavering campaign to regard security and privacy as human rights. this position is not just different from other technology companies but is downright remarkable given the amount of risk cook is willing to take on by believing so firmly in those stances. last year cook gave a speech at the electronic privacy information centers champions of freedom event where he came down harshly on companies monetizing user data and not doing enough to educate customers as to how their personal information is being used. while some thought cook was being a hypocrite by not recognizing what is seemingly the contradiction found with apples future and greater data collection cooks message regarding privacy was focused on the customer. the number one priority is to let the customer know what data is being collected and how it is being used. apple knew that type of practice is simply not found in silicon valley and cook was determined to keep apple on a different course. another incident highlighting cooks passion regarding security and privacy was on display when he sat down with charlie rose following the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch and a few weeks after the icloud celebrity hacking incident. when referring to rumors that apple had created a backdoor to its servers tim cook exclaimed to rose they would have to cart us out in a box  before apple created a backdoor. the message was clear. apple was going to fight for its users and would be willing to go as far as the u. s. supreme court which now seems quite likely. trustanother key attribute to tim cooks legacy has been trust. over the years two events have come to demonstrate cooks intense belief that customer trust is one of the most important values behind the apple experience the apple maps debacle and apple retail turmoil. in 00NUMBER00 following the botched apple maps launch which saw a mapping service in rough shape in terms of accuracy and usefulness tim cook took it upon himself to issue an apology to apple customers. the first and last paragraphs of the apology letter highlighted cooks underlining motivation  to our customersat apple we strive to make world class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers. with the launch of our new maps last week we fell short on this commitment. we are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make maps better. . . everything we do at apple is aimed at making our products the best in the world. we know that you expect that from us and we will keep working non stop until maps lives up to the same incredibly high standard. it has been reported that scott forstall who oversaw ios software and apple maps was fired due to his refusal to officially apologize for an inferior apple maps product. from cooks perspective forstalls actions posed a threat to the apple experience with trust at the heart of the issue. apple had spent years building goodwill with customers with the end result being hundreds of millions of users trusting apple that its products would lead to a top notch experience. with apple maps forstall put this apple experience at risk and cook took decisive action. this intense focus on the apple experience soon become tim cooks primary motive in everything he has since done leading apple. cooks focus on nurturing customer trust was also seen in his handling of apple retail. after ron johnson left as head of apple retail in 00NUMBER00 apples retail operations entered a tumultuous period. the iconic stores were still seeing incredible levels of traffic and sales per square foot but the customer experience was deteriorating. cook ended up making one of his biggest blunders to date by hiring john browett to take over apple retail. instead of focusing on the experience produced by the apple retail stores browett looked at physical apple retail locations as profit centers. after being on the job for just 00NUMBER00 months cook fired browett. along with the apple maps fiasco browetts quick dismissal showed that cook was comfortable admitting mistakes and taking swift action to correct those mistakes. more importantly cook learned from those mistakes. a year later angela ahrendts was brought on board to lead apple retail. her success at burberry was a result of taking the luxury retail playbook and ripping it up by embracing technology. ahrendts placed the experience above all else. in fact ahrendts has publicly mentioned she doesnt consider herself a great retailer but instead someone who understands people and the importance of building the right kind of retail team. this caught cooks attention. he knew that apple retail stores were a great tool to build customer trust in terms of the personal touch that apple retail employees provide such as sales support service and workshops. equality and ethicsin 00NUMBER00 the new york times published its  the ieconomy   series which took a closer look at the negatives associated with globalization. apples supply chain was thrown into the spotlight. apples reliance on its supply chain was illustrated through descriptions and tales of unacceptable working conditions. it has been reported that cook thought the new york times investigative series was not accurate and very misleading. instead of being content with the progress apple had already been making with its supply chain the ieconomy series seemed to reenergize cook. he was on a mission to place apple as the champion of human rights that went well beyond what other companies were doing. he wanted apple to be the undisputed leader. cook placed jeff williams as the executive monitoring third party contract manufacturer and supplier working conditions. while there is still much progress to be made cooks focus on human rights issues once again relates back to the apple experience. there is a story behind every apple product including how it is made and cook understood that the apple experience began all the way back with the raw materials at factories and mines. in addition cook has pushed for equality in other parts of daily life becoming much more vocal in current political affairs by using apples power and standing to extend his reach. while it may be hard to find the direct relationship between these actions and apple products tim cooks motivation is clear apple is a company that stands for everyone. environmentally responsibilityapples aggressive stance on green initiatives has been well chronicled in the press but the motivation behind the actions are still being underestimated. whether it was creating working forests in maine and north carolina or building extensive solar projects in china cook has embarked apple on a mission to minimize its impact on the environment. cook hired lisa jackson former environmental protection agency chief in 00NUMBER00 to oversee apples environmental practices. its not that this focus on being environmentally focused started with cooks imagination especially since we can look back at how apple embarked on more environmental friendly decisions in its product lineup under steve jobs. however cook felt that apples leadership status in the global economy placed it in an unique position to serve as an example for others. the productapples mission is to create products that people love. when judging tim cooks performance the mistake many people have been making is analyzing the apple ceo position as a seat that has to be filled with a product visionary like steve jobs. not only is this faulty logic but it fails to comprehend cooks strengths. tim cook is apples ceo because he is not a product visionary. apples current success was not due to steve jobs carrying the company on his shoulders. thanks to apples revamped public relations strategy we have gotten a better look at how the apple machine actually operates. there is much more going on behind the scenes than a dictator not allowing debate disagreement discussion and collaboration. even though cook is not a product person this fact does not take anything away from apple or his legacy since jony ive is purveyor of apples product mission. in fact evidence would suggest jony ive has actually been the purveyor of apples product philosophy for over 00NUMBER00. cook is confident that the executive team he has assembled will promote debate and discussion just like in the past leading to products that people love. meanwhile cook dedicates his time and energy to overseeing the management team responsible for this debate and discussion while strengthening the apple experience by looking at values that go beyond the tangible product. a defining momenttim cooks message to customers last week regarding iphone security  will go down as one of the defining moments of his tenure as ceo because it perfectly encapsulated cooks motivation as ceo. according to cook the best way to keep apples mission statement focused on the product is to embrace and strengthen ideals that strengthen the relationship with customers. one paragraph from cooks letter stood out   while we believe the fbis intentions are good it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. and ultimately we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect. cooks letter wasnt just about an 00NUMBER00 or encryption. instead cook took a stand protecting the very same ideals that the u. s. government is tasked to protect. apple is known as the iphone company today but could very well be known as a personal transportation business in 00NUMBER00. despite this changing product mix cook knows the ideals he is focused on promoting within apples culture will remain unchanged. the tim cook legacy will one day be remembered as the era in which these ideals were established and engrained into the apple experience. even though the product will always be at the center of it all hardware and software can only go so far in advancing humanity. see also national oilwell varco prepare for the imminent dividend cut  on seekingalphacomthe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not

generation iphone widely expected to be called the 00NUMBER00. the user asked what is so highly anticipated about the iphone 00NUMBER00 the poster went on to argue that weve reached a point with the iphone 00NUMBER00 where the phone is so  good that improving upon it in any meaningful way is. . . difficult. if this individuals argument held true then it would indeed be bad news for apple as upgrade cycles would likely lengthen fairly significantly. however as somebody who owns both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus i can say the avenues of meaningful  improvement from here on out remain blindingly obvious. here are a few that spring to mind. the displays    the displays on apples latest iphones are good but they are far and away from perfect. they lag in many important ways relative to some flagship android devices i. e. galaxy 00NUMBER00 such as in color accuracy contrast ratio and many other key metrics at least according to highly respected display analysis expert raymond soneira of display mate. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 i expect apple to deliver a substantial boost in display quality that will be immediately obvious to anybody who compares the two devices side by side. in addition to improvements in image quality i expect apple to finally up the ante in terms of display resolution. apples premium flagships have less sharp displays than some mid range devices that are currently on the marketadditionally since apple probably wont transition to oled based displays until at least the iphone 00NUMBER00 but more likely the iphone 00NUMBER00 theres still at least one more low hanging fruit beyond iphone 00NUMBER00 that apple can capture as far as iphone displays go. the cameras    the cameras on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are good for smartphone cameras but there is a long way for them to go before they are anywhere close to being able to capture images anywhere near the quality of a reasonable dslr. i believe that smartphone users particularly premium phone users value camera image quality. innovations along this particular vector which will require some heavy duty engineering in sensor design optics and in the image signal processor embedded in the companys a series chips should pay off nicely in terms of selling points. industrial design    apple prides itself on its industrial designs and for good reason many folks view their devices as status symbols and it wouldnt be surprising if many phone users base purchasing decisions at least partially on visual appearance texture and the other elements that make up the look and feel of the device. additionally theres still plenty of room for the iphone to become slimmer and more compact even given the same screen real estate. many reviewers criticized the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus devices as being simply too unwieldy even 00NUMBER00 inch devices. i share the popular view that apple should focus on slimming down the bezels on its phones both the top and side ones in order to reduce the physical footprints of its devices. doing so should lead to better scores and sentiment in third party reviews of the devices potentially helping the idevice maker to catalyze upgrades and maybe even gain share. although there will come a time when iphone upgrades will really seem incremental and may even be underwhelming generation over generation though tim cook reportedly  told employees that he sees iphone growth for decades i dont think were there just yet. the iphone is still an extremely imperfect device with plenty of obvious avenues of improvement for apple to pursue. this comment isnt mean to disparage  apple but to express my optimism that the idevice maker may still have plenty of tricks up its proverbial sleeve to allow apple to actually grow sales of this product category for years to come. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the

nasdaq inc.  investorplace  investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tipsbetween its privacy battle with the fbi and concerns over flagging iphone 00NUMBER00 sales apple inc. aapl    has taken a bit of a beating on the sentiment front. options traders have begun to edge toward put options on  apple stock   and the shares have stagnated in the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 range. despite this growing sense of unease there are still a plethora of opportunities for aapl stock options traders. before diving into the trading ideas let take a quick look at apple stocks sentiment and technical outlooks. for one wall street analysts remain extremely bullish on the shares. in fact data from thomsonfirst call reveals that 00NUMBER00 of the 00NUMBER00 analysts following the shares rate aapl stock a buy or better with no sell ratings to be found. furthermore the 00NUMBER00 month consensus price target of 00NUMBER00 per share represents a 00NUMBER00 premium for apple stock. since aapl stocks price target has taken a bit of a hit due to iphone sales projections i would expect this figure to rise once more details of the iphone 00NUMBER00 begin to trickle out. outside of wall street options traders have grown increasingly restless. currently the marchapril putcall open interest ratio for apple stock rests at 00NUMBER00. calls still outnumber puts among short term aapl options but this somewhat elevated ratio represents a sense of unease from options traders. click to enlarge  turning our attention toward march implieds march 00NUMBER00 series options are pricing in a roughly 00NUMBER00 move for apple stock during the next month. this places the upper bound at about 00NUMBER00 while the lower bound lies at around 00NUMBER00. aapl stock has stout technical support in the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 region while resistance is building overhead near 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. put sell  typically aapl call spreads are the way to go to take advantage of the stocks longer term uptrend. however current market conditions and the fight with the fbi have taken their toll on aapl. because of this an out of the money put sell position may be the best option when trading apple stock over the short term. at last check the aapl march 00NUMBER00 put was bid at 00NUMBER00 cents 00NUMBER00 per contract. the upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as apple stock closes above 00NUMBER00 when march options expire on march 00NUMBER00. the downside is that should aapl trade below 00NUMBER00 ahead of expiration you could be 00NUMBER00 shares for each sold put at a cost of 00NUMBER00 per share. call spread  if youre jonesing for an apple stock bull trade then a 00NUMBER00 bull call spread has potential. at last check this spread was offered at 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 per pair of contracts. breakeven lies at 00NUMBER00 while a maximum profit of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 per pair of contracts is possible if aapl trades at or above 00NUMBER00 when march options expire. as of this writing joseph hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post dont give up on aapl yet 00NUMBER00 trades for apple inc. stock  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apples iphone 00NUMBER00 isnt done yet. image source apple. apple   is expected to launch a successor to the popular 00NUMBER00 in just under a month known as the iphone se. the device per generally reliable kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo via appleinsider   is expected to feature substantial hardware upgrades from the iphone 00NUMBER00. indeed it is said to be essentially an 00NUMBER00 in a 00NUMBER00 inch form factor sans the costly 00NUMBER00 touch feature. the device is expected to be priced at between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 bet is on 00NUMBER00 for the variant with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage and 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 gb quite a nice price for such a fully loaded iphone. perhaps whats more interesting though is that kuo believes that apple will slash the price of its venerable iphone 00NUMBER00 by a full 00NUMBER00. the variant with 00NUMBER00 gb of storage sells for 00NUMBER00 off contract with the 00NUMBER00 gb model going for 00NUMBER00. a 00NUMBER00 price cut would bring these prices down to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 respectively. lets take a closer look at what if true this might mean for investors. this is a smart plan to bulk up the installed base    apple customers tend to be loyal so its in the companys best interests to grow its installed base as much as possible. once these buyers are hooked theres a good chance they will bring revenue in the future through additional device purchases ipad mac etc. upgrades to new iphones later on and even use of the companys growing and lucrative set of software and services. the iphone 00NUMBER00 though hardly a leading edge device these days is a well built attractive and fast device that should serve as a relatively low cost gateway to the appleios ecosystem. at this point its also probably very  cheap for apple to make as manufacturing yields on this device are certainly quite high and the components inside are so old that apple can probably acquire them quite cheaply. is there much risk of cannibalization    perhaps the biggest risk here is that of cannibalization of the companys newer large screen iphone 00NUMBER00 series of devices or even its upcoming 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se. the first thing i should note is that i very much doubt that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will continue to be offered in mature markets. its quite likely that these ultra cheap iphones will be targeted at regions think emerging markets in which apple has very little market segment share due to the high prices of its devices relative to average personal income in those countries. i would peg cannibalization risk as quite minimal if apple goes about this properly. risk of gross margin erosion    another risk that investors might be worried about is the potential gross profit margin erosion that may occur as a result of such a price cut. after all an iphone 00NUMBER00 sold 00NUMBER00 is certainly going to bring in far more  gross profit dollars than an iphone 00NUMBER00 sold at just 00NUMBER00. however if apple sees a substantial surge in demand for the devices the incremental unit shipments particularly in regions where iphones are simply inaccessible could be enough to allow for at least a similar amount of total gross profit dollars gross profit per unit multiplied by number of units even if per unit margins are lower. with that in mind even if  apple doesnt sell enough incremental units to make up for the lost per unit margins it could justify this as a longer term bet installed baseuser acquisition that wont pay off until sometime down the road. such a move obviously carries risk but i doubt the decision makers at apple will implement such a move without carefully weighing the benefits and risks. if true a good move from apple    i think that a significant price cut on the iphone 00NUMBER00 sold into certain strategic regions makes quite a lot of sense. its imperative that the company grow its installed base and raise awareness of its brand in markets where iphones sold at todays prices are simply inaccessible. by employing this strategy rather than developing targeted low cost products apple can sell what is undeniably a high quality if somewhat dated product at an entry level price point. no compromise of apples fundamental principles required. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when

iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. image credit apple. benzinga recently got ahold of a report from smbc nikko securities in which the analysts claim that apple  may be preparing yet another round of iphone production cuts as a result of excess inventories. its not clear whether the analysts refer to iphone inventory in the distribution channel or at apple itself. adding additional color the analysts say that inventories of current iphone models stand at 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million units and that these inventories are unlikely to be absorbed even following the sharp cutbacks to production in jan mar. the cause of these reportedly high inventories apparently stem from weak demand. although the above may seem plausible heres where the report loses credibility with me. attraction of the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be weak    after saying that the current iphone demand is weak the report goes on to say that the next generation iphone widely called the iphone 00NUMBER00 wont do much to stimulate customer demand. indeed benzinga says that the smbc analysts believe that apple doesnt have any major hardware specification changes planned. the report apparently further goes on to claim that apple wont be using new display panels in the new phones recycling the same ones from the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which in turn were recycled from the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. im not buying it. if apple doesnt have any major changes planned what do they expect to sell iphone 00NUMBER00 on    apple spends substantially  in research and development far more than the majority of its peers in the smartphone market. its hard to imagine that with all of the development resources that the company puts behind each of its projects especially ones as important as its new number iphones that no major spec changes would be anything close to acceptable for it. indeed it was apple marketing chief phil schiller who told bloomberg  back ahead of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch that the bar for functionality is higher with every generation and that apple cant tell customers that this years iphone does the same thing that last years iphone did but 00NUMBER00 better. i dont think making the device just a bit thinner or putting in a faster 00NUMBER00 chip qualifies as a major leap in functionality either. what makes even less sense is the claim that apple will reuse the same exact lcd panels that were found on the 00NUMBER00 plus. apple is already falling behind major android flagships in display performance displaymates raymond soneira said in an email to forbes  contributor brooke crothers that the idevice makers current flagships are running well behind the display curve so it seems ludicrous to think that apple wont update those panels. indeed with major apple display vendor japan display having recently commenced mass production  of its pixel eyes 00NUMBER00 displays which bring about a host of improvements over its first generation pixel eyes displays i would be stunned if apple didnt use a new generation of displays on iphone 00NUMBER00. this report seems questionable    at this point i find it hard to believe that smbcs claims of another big round of iphone production cuts will hold particularly in light of commentary around iphone 00NUMBER00 that simply doesnt jive with what the idevice maker is likely to bring out. if other analystsbrokerage houses come out with similar independent reports of further production cutsinventory glut then it might be time for investors to brace for said cuts. but were i an apple shareholder

like its current standoff with washington but would keep the matter low profile and possibly try to find other ways to placate beijing. as the high profile standoff between apple and washington continues over access to information on a terrorists iphone a new report is raising the interesting question of what the us tech giant might do if faced with a similar situation in china. actually the what if scenario isnt raised too much in the los angeles times report which instead focuses more on the cozier relationship that apple has with beijing in terms of allowing access to sensitive information related to its products. but this still looks like a good opportunity to explore the what if angle since apple might find far fewer friends in china if it decided to defy a beijing order to hand over information stored on the chinese iphone of a known terrorist. by comparison the us technology giant has found at least some supporters for its refusal to help the fbi access information stored on the iphone of syed rizwan farook the man behind the worst terrorist attack in the us since september 00NUMBER00. apple has far more reason to move more cautiously in china than it has in the high profile us case. china has boomed to become the companys second largest market in the last few years with local sales now accounting for more than a fifth of its total. the architect of that boom has been apple ceo tim cook who has personally traveled to china at least twice a year over the last few years to lead a huge campaign to improve his companys image in the country. after that huge investment of time and resources apple might be far less eager for a similar high profile confrontation with beijing that could easily result in a total loss of all that effort. at the same beijing is even more sensitive about national security than washington especially when it comes to terrorism. while the us worries mostly about terrorism from abroad china has more immediate worries from homegrown terrorists from its far western xinjiang region who have carried out numerous attacks in recent years. that threat played a big factor in chinas introduction last year of a controversial new national security law which foreign companies complained was overly intrusive and vague. against that backdrop lets look at the latest report that shows just how far apple has gone to play along with chinas national security fears. apples first and biggest move on that front was its controversial decision two years ago to move data for its china users to china based servers from offshore ones  english article previous post. last year aapl made another big concession by allowing government security audits for products it sells in china  previous post. better accessboth moves were designed to give beijing access to information on iphone users in china if and when chinese investigators wanted to access such information. but chinas legal processes are far less transparent than the us and many worried that beijing was simply laying the foundation for demanding any information it wanted from apple. such information could involve suspected terrorists but also potentially political dissidents or really anyone the beijing government considered a threat. so far we havent heard anything about beijing making requests of apple similar to the ones being made by washington. but thats probably because apple is unlikely to publicize such requests and neither is beijing. internet company yahoo  yhoo   yielded to one such request more than a decade ago involving a dissidents e mail account and came under fire in the west even as it said its decision was required by chinese law. so where does all of this leave apple and whats the likelihood that it would comply with similar requests by beijing frankly speaking i have little doubt that apple would at the very least be far more low profile in any such confrontation with beijing and would certainly keep it out of the headlines. tim cook is probably hoping he never needs to make that decision either. but i suspect that if and when the time comes which seems inevitable apple would probably quietly hand over the information or at least find some other way to placate beijing. see also seeking alphas market challenge ready to fly with airlines  on seekingalphacomthe views and opinions expressed herein are the

streaming music. to do so spotify has relied upon a mix of sleek design and savvy product innovation while apple has largely relied on its millions of users and renowned marketing muscle to get apple music off the ground. while the two companies continue their global battle  for users a recent example from spotify demonstrates why this two horse race is just getting started. the enemy of my enemy   last week spotify announced a promotion in the u. s. and u. k. that offers new subscribers to spotify premium a free chromecast from alphabet   subsidiary google. source spotify. digging deeper into the specifics the promotion runs through the end of february excluding leap day strangely and gives users of spotify premium access for the first three months at 00NUMBER00 total plus the aforementioned chromecast from alphabet. for context alphabets chromecast typically retails for 00NUMBER00. the move has been derided by some media outlets as a sign that spotify is in fact feeling the heat from apple music. while ill never argue that spotify likely isnt acutely aware of the competitive threat that is apple music i see this simply as good business on spotifys part. moreover its this kind of scrappy outside the box thinking that has enabled spotify to remain ahead of its larger vastly richer rival. the great subscriber land grab   the economics of the music business are murky to say the least. streaming services like spotify and apple music negotiate their licensing deals directly with major recording labels behind closed doors which has in the past led to some seemingly bizarre financial arrangements. as a quick aside this differs from pandora  s royalty rates which technically operate as a passive product whose rates like those of all radio stations are resultantly set  by the u. s. copyright royalty board. this will also change when pandora launches its own on demand product a smart move for pandora. source spotifyeither way this inherent opaqueness within its sales structure makes modeling spotifys revenue difficult. however as with many freemium services one thing is abundantly clear premium subscribers are the key to long term success. according to an analysis leaked of 00NUMBER00 data industry journal music business worldwide  estimated that spotify generated a mere 00NUMBER00 euros per free user versus 00NUMBER00 euros per premium user. this is of course old data and spotify has likely improved its advertising revenue per user in the interim. however the general point  that subscribers tend to be vastly more lucrative for services like spotify is the main takeaway here. as spotify continues to work toward establishing itself as a mature stand alone business the swedish music upstart will continue to experiment with promotional initiatives to drive users from the less profitable free accounts to more valuable premium subscriptions. its only good business sense. its also worth noting that converting free users to paid users which brings with it additional features like offline listening creates greater switching costs. as such premium subscribers are doubly valuable to an upstart like spotify in that they can help insulate it from a rival like apple music. while some misinterpret spotifys use of promotions as a red flag the reality is that its simply sound execution from the worlds largest on demand music service. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just

stock market news stock advice trading tipsapple inc. aapl    shareholders are well aware of the contentious back and forth going on right now between apple and the federal bureau of investigation. the fbi wants apple to help it access one of the san bernardino shooters iphones apple says its a slippery slope that could compromise the security of millions of americans yada yada yada. i immediately regret using the phrase yada yada yada. this is actually a monumental confrontation and one that will likely have repercussions on how government and big business cooperate with each other for years to come when it comes to the delicate and ever present balance of privacy vs. national security. while this doesnt have immediate repercussions for the aapl stock price which could use some help its down 00NUMBER00 in the last year it very well could have a longer term impact on apple shares. people like to know that someones sticking up for them and given the current distrust of the government apple has an opportunity to make its pro privacy stance known. the top brass in cupertino certainly have been making their stance known and have effectively used the media to try to show their allegiance to users. but one recent revelation throws apples supposed allegiance to users in doubt and that could end up coming back to bite aapl stock in the long run. apple enjoyed a big judicial win on monday when a federal judge in new york ruled that the government doesnt have the legal authority to force aapl to help the drug enforcement administration break into a drug dealers phone. its one of 00NUMBER00 instances across the country in which the government is seeking apples help in accessing user phones. and although on the face of it thats a win for apple a footnote in the case could come back to bite the iconic company. the department of justice claims that aapl originally  agreed   to help the feds access the drug dealers phone. per a cnn money  report published late mondayapple â€¦ only changed course when the governments application for assistance was made public by the court the department said in a statement on monday implying that apple is merely doing this to save face and seem protective of customers privacy. the piece was specifically referring to a statement from the doj made on monday. apple in response copped to offering its help to the dea but claims it was only willing to do so if uncle sam made a  lawful   request. in any case the optics arent great and it raises doubts as to aapls true intentions. if the government continues to raise issues like this in the other cases apple could come across as just another insincere company playing media games to bend public perception to its will. time will tell how this issue plays out but suffice it to say there is no great resolution here even if ultimately most users feel apple  is   honestly trying to protect their privacy theres been a meaningful amount of backlash from people who feel aapl is being anti american by refusing to help feds access the san bernardino shooters phone. its true that shareholders have bigger things to worry about like stagnating iphone sales and consistently declining ipad sales but this privacy debate is another storyline that doesnt do much good for aapl stock. as of this writing john divine did not hold a position in any of the

but that is set to change this fall. a little while ago kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo claimed that apple  would release two versions of the plus version of its upcoming smartphone. one would have a traditional single lens camera while a higher end model would come with a dual lens camera taking advantage of the technology that the idevice maker got when it acquired linx imaging in 00NUMBER00. although a number of people were skeptical that the company would actually segment its product line like this it would appear that this will indeed be the case in a new research note from kuo the analyst reportedly via macrumors   reaffirms his prior claim. given kuos nearly spotless track record with respect to future apple product predictions its a pretty safe bet that the idevice maker will go ahead with this plan. its good business    iphone revenue is a function of two things units sold and average selling price per device. as the smartphone market matures the company will need to include increasingly compelling features in order to convince owners of older but still perfectly good iphones to upgrade. this means that apple has to bring quite a lot of innovation to every new iphone. however its important to realize that apple is running a business designed to maximize profits so it needs to be mindful of the cost structures of the devices it sells. of course for a given target gross profit margin level a phone that sells for more can support a greater bill of materials cost than one that sells for less. this is why a higher tiermore expensive iphone with an improved camera makes a lot of sense. for those willing to pay the option for a better camera is there    i have no doubt that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus single lens version will have dramatically improved camera subsystems from 00NUMBER00 plus phones. for the majority of iphone buyers these devices should prove sufficient. however there are certainly those customers that are willing to pay extra for a better camera experience. for those customers apple looks as though it will offer them something worthwhile for additional money. its not clear what proportion of iphone buyers will value the dual lens camera system enough to buy up the stack but i suspect that it will be a large enough number to move the needle for apples iphone average selling prices. indeed keeping the dual lens feature exclusive to a larger screen iphone actually serves to boost average selling prices in two interesting waysbuyers who would have normally purchased the a large iphone anyway now move up the product stack andbuyers who would normally have purchased the smaller iphone but find significant value in a superior camera could move two tiers up in the iphone product stack. the impact on apples blended iphone average selling prices will obviously depend on a number of factors but a third ultra premium iphone tier can only help the company here. what increased average selling prices can do    iphone revenue is a function of both average selling price and units shipped. obviously the company is going to do its best to growth both but if apple can drive iphone revenue growth by driving average selling prices up faster than unit growth which may be necessary as the smartphone market matures then this is a perfectly valid strategy to deliver value to shareholders. at the end of the day though as long as apple can drive revenue and profit from iphone up i dont think that shareholders will worry too much about the nitty gritty of how such growth is achieved. 00NUMBER00 companies

value during that time. the decline in the stock price comes as the companys iphone business which has grown each and every year since its birth in 00NUMBER00 is on track for its first ever year over year unit and revenue decline in fiscal 00NUMBER00. aapl  data by ychartsthe drop apple cfo luca maestri said on the companys most recent earnings call is attributable to a weakening macroeconomic environment as well as foreign exchange headwinds. maestri said that in the march quarter apple faces a 00NUMBER00 basis point foreign exchange headwind year over year. however although the forex headwinds impact demand outside of the united states that doesnt explain why apple saw a 00NUMBER00 decline year over year in north america last quarter. i suspect that a weak showing with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus is partly to blame. that said according to a report from analysts with j. p. morgan via apple insider it would seem that the worst might be over for apples iphone business leading to a surge in the companys stock price. whats the scoop    per the analysts apple will ship around 00NUMBER00 million iphone units in the march quarter implying a whopping 00NUMBER00 over year decline in unit shipments from the prior year period. however the analysts are reportedly expecting apple to ship 00NUMBER00 million units in the june quarter apparently up from a prior forecast of a 00NUMBER00 drop sequentially. although a shipment figure of 00NUMBER00 million units in the june quarter would still represent a slight drop from the 00NUMBER00 figure in the prior year a 00NUMBER00 decline this is far less bad than what apple is expected to see in the march quarter. indeed apple ceo tim cook did say on the most recent earnings call that the march quarter results represent the toughest year over year compare implying that he believes that the year over year declines should moderate in the june and september quarters. how many iphones will apple sell in fiscal 00NUMBER00 the j. p. morgan analysts may have provided their own full year iphone estimates in the report apple insider didnt report this. to that end ill provide my own based on the j. p. morgan march and june quarter estimates. apple sold about 00NUMBER00 million iphones in the fiscal first quarter. if we assume that the fiscal second and third quarters will come in at around 00NUMBER00 million each apple will ship 00NUMBER00 million units during the first three quarters of the year. if we assume that apple sees about a 00NUMBER00 year over year drop in iphone units during the fiscal fourth quarter that would suggest shipments of around 00NUMBER00 million units. for the full year that would put iphone unit shipments at around 00NUMBER00 units. that number would represent a year over year decline of about 00NUMBER00 from the blowout shipment figures in fiscal 00NUMBER00. that isnt ideal but its far from the  doomsday   scenario smbc nikko securities recently floated in which apple is on track to see units decline by 00NUMBER00 for the full year. a return to growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00 will be interesting to see if apple can get iphone back on a growth path in fiscal 00NUMBER00. at this point i firmly believe that apples success or lack thereof in doing so rests squarely on the iphone 00NUMBER00. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 is a major leap from the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus and is easily best in class throughout its life cycle then a return to growth even modest growth seems achievable. if not then i fully expect iphone sales to continue to decline as the current iphone installed base opts not to upgrade and market segment share gains prove difficult to achieve. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are

informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence. in the current case facing apple  aapl   the terrorists who had possession of the phone are deceased. however in one of the next times apple is called upon to open up a phone to enable access chances are good that the person in possession of a phone during an illegal and possibly heinous act will be alive be an american citizen and demand to have the assistance of counsel for his defence. in the event apple loses the current case to the fbi setting a precedent that they can be compelled to unlock phones for the fbi and other government agencies each and every defendant in such cases will have the assistance of counsel for their defense. what do you expect every defense lawyer to do in order to protect their client who has had a phone openedonce the phone is cracked by apple or any device or operating system developer whatever is found by the fbi or whatever government agency is involved is going to be labeled planted or false evidence. the defendants lawyer is going to scream as loud as they can that whatever was found was not originated by their client. that apple in cahoots with the government agency modified their software to not only unlock the phone but to also write to the device everything the government agency needs to gain a conviction. pictures. texts. logs. files. videos. all originated andor imported by the code in order to gain a conviction. the best way to disprove this allegation by the defense attorneyline by line publication of the code used to open it. reviewed by who knows how qualified and how many experts who will pass judgement based upon who paid them. possibly a line by line presentation of the code to a jury of the defendants peers. yes the fbi and apple would do everything possible to try to stop this presentation but what if they can notwhich is exactly why apple must win the current case against the fbi. there is a near zero chance that the code created by apple to break into their phones can stay private under current laws. i also want to address the notion that we let the police or government agents into our homes or that we allow some of our digital data to be acquired using warrants and subpoenas. the difference is in the ability for a defense attorney to be able to determine whether or not physical or digital evidence is false evidence. with physical evidence there are always risks of planted evidence but the processes are in place to contest that evidence. with digital evidence as direct data the best if not only way to prove that the code was not written to plant digital evidence is by showing the code. which is exactly why i think this apple vs. the fbi case is nothing like any of the current search and seizure examples being given in the media. in those examples the software that creates collects or aggregates that data can be presented to an open court without risk. want to see the devices code and databases that collect process and store your easy pass driving data no problem. seeing the process doesnt open a door for you to hack into it and change it. a defense attorney can question the credibility or accuracy of that data and no one else except easy pass users are impacted or care. the same concept can be applied to the phone meta data about us that is collected by the phone companies our social media footprint whatever. we may not like it. in fact we may hate it but reviewing and questioning the process or the data doesnt create risk if that specific code or process is presented in court. if apple or any digital device or operating system provider has to write code that breaks into their own phones and then present that code in open court to prove that the code is clean and has not planted digital evidence then the door is wide open for bad actors to do as they please to our devices. no one can play whack a mole with code fast enough to keep them out. all that said there is a possibly better option if we only had lawmakers who cared more about solutions than grandstanding. we have three senators running for president and not one has moved a fingernail to even begin to deal with this issue let alone find a solution. that is sad in and of itself. what should they propose as i wrote in a previous blog post   lawmakers should be working very quickly to write and get passed a law that limits the scope of what apple must respond to. here is what i suggesteda company can only be compelled to remove any type of security or encryption from a smartphone or tablet and only a smartphone or tablet under the following circumstancesthere has been an event with casualties that has been declared an act of terrorism. there has been an event with casualties that has been declared an act of terrorism. there is reason to believe that the smartphone was possessed by a participant in the act of terrorism. there is reason to believe that the smartphone was possessed by a participant in the act of terrorism. the smartphone must have been on premise during the event. the smartphone must have been on premise during the event. the terrorist who was in possession of the smartphone or tablet must be deceased. the terrorist who was in possession of the smartphone or tablet must be deceased. it would seem to me that if such a law could be proposed and passed then the all writs act currently at the heart of the apple vs. fbi dispute would no longer apply. by eliminating the all writs act as a catch all we significantly flatten out the slippery slope. im not saying we will completely eliminate all privacy issues. we wont. im not saying there isnt risk of unintended consequences. there always are when we ask politicians to fix complex problems. more importantly passing this law or something similar gives both apple and the fbi a means to resolve the dilemma they face. apple could comply with at least the hope that the circumstances under which they will be forced to create software to open a device is strictly limited in scope. as always this is my opinion. im not an attorney so i welcome all constructive criticism and feedback so i can become smarter about the subject at hand. you can reach me to discuss one on one

inch ipad family in just under a month according to numerous reports. apples ipad sales have plunged over the last couple of years with the decline being blamed largely on long ipadtablet upgrade cycles as well as cannibalization of tablets by large smartphones. lets take a look at everything we know so far about this next generation ipad 00NUMBER00 mark gurman says will be branded ipad pro rather than ipad air. everything we loved about the big ipad pro    the ipad pro brought some interesting technical innovations. the 00NUMBER00 chip inside smashed tablet performance records with truly excellent cpu and graphics performance. the display also featured some neat tricks such as a variable display refresh rate and support for the companys unique take on the stylus known as the apple pencil. the device also has quite a nice four speaker system something that i missed quite a bit once i returned my ipad pro  and went back to using my ipad air 00NUMBER00. according to gurman the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad will be getting the same blazing fast 00NUMBER00 chip support for the apple pencil and even sport the same smart connector that allows users to hook up peripherals such as apples smart keyboard. frankly i would have been shocked if apple didnt  include support for these add ons as im sure apple is quite keen to move as many of these high priced accessories as possible. even better than the larger ipad pro in this key way    per gurman the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro will actually be better than the 00NUMBER00 inch variant in one key way the camera. previous leaks pointed to apple including a flash on the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro the 00NUMBER00 inch model doesnt have this but it seems that apple is going a step further. the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro is expected to feature the 00NUMBER00 megapixel camera sensor thats found on the iphone 00NUMBER00. this sensor didnt exactly bring massive image quality improvements over the 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensor found in the 00NUMBER00 plus but images are higher resolution and therefore sharper. a better display too    the display on the ipad air 00NUMBER00 has been long overdue for an update. according to raymond soneira with displaymate the display found on the air 00NUMBER00 is inferior to both the one found on the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 as well as the one found on the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. that apparently is about to change. per gurman the new ipad pro is expected to come with an updated display with enhancements to both brightness as well as the anti glare coating that first made its debut with the ipad air 00NUMBER00. indeed in soneiras article discussing the different ipad displays the display expert says that next generation displays will need to further lower display reflectance as well as implement some other new features in order to boost image quality. a second generation anti reflective coating seems just the sort of thing that soneira is looking for and i look forward to seeing how this new ipad pro does in real world tests. this is the ipad weve been looking for but it might not be enough to rekindle growth    when the large ipad pro came out i gave it a shot but was ultimately unhappy with just how gargantuan the device is. in my mind the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad is the perfect tablet size and the improvements that apple is apparently bringing to the table sound quite compelling. whether itll be enough to help ipad sales out of their funk or not remains to be seen however. apple failed to return ipad to year over year growth with the introductions of the ipad

headlines surrounding the company are focused on speculation about the smaller iphone the company is expected to launch at the event. but it will be the companys refresh of its flagship iphone lineup which will likely occur this fall that will have the most influence on revenue during the next 00NUMBER00 months. turning to apples iphone 00NUMBER00 aimed to replace the iphone 00NUMBER00 which is still selling well for the company one analyst estimates apples rumored smaller iphone could contribute as much 00NUMBER00 billion in incremental annual revenue  during apples fiscal 00NUMBER00. so it makes sense that investors are focused on this upcoming potential product launch. but this doesnt stop the continued speculation about apples rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 from proliferating. rumors surrounding apples flagship iphone have started ramping up recently. a new report from japanese site mac otakara via macrumors   released monday night is particularly interesting as it seems to support previous rumors and speculation about the device giving rumors about the iphone 00NUMBER00 more substance. heres a roundup of the latest rumors about iphone 00NUMBER00. no 00NUMBER00 headphone jack  as mac otakara has previously reported the site still believes the device will not have a headphone jack. this rumor was also endorsed  by 00NUMBER00 mark gurman who has a very strong track record with apple rumors. instead of using the 00NUMBER00 jack to connect headphones gurman and mac otakara speculate the device will either require connection via the lighting connector or wirelessly over bluetooth. nearly as thin as apples 00NUMBER00 ipod touch  the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be about 00NUMBER00 thick approximately 00NUMBER00 than the iphone 00NUMBER00 or in the same thickness of apples ipod touch. ipod touch. image source apple. not waterproof  contrary to some speculation that the iphone 00NUMBER00 would be waterproof and sport new materials for the outer body mac otakara predicts the new device will have the same aluminum material and have the same water resistance as the 00NUMBER00. no dual lens camera on iphone 00NUMBER00 otakara agreed with previous speculation that the iphone 00NUMBER00 not sport apples rumored new dual lens camera system but the japanese site noted it was unclear whether or not the new camera system will be included in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. so far speculation has only suggested the dual lens would be included on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and not the iphone 00NUMBER00 to help differentiate it from its smaller counterpart. other rumors about iphone 00NUMBER00 circulating include expectations for a flush rear camera stereo speakers and upgraded processors. apple needs a huge success   apple management is currently guiding for a year over year decline in revenue for its current quarter blaming economic headwinds and tough comparisons for iphone sales in the year ago quarter. while the companys rumored smaller iphone launch this month could help beef up unit sales enough to prevent further year over year declines in the segment and possibly even apples total revenue it will be the iphone 00NUMBER00

during apples annual shareholder meeting in february some income investors who own  apple stock  may have been relieved to hear apple ceo tim cook promise to continue to provide investors with annual increases. of course this wasnt news. apple had already promised investors this several years ago. in the companys april 00NUMBER00 release announcing a dividend increase the release stated apple plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis. but the ceos reaffirmation that apple is still planning annual dividend increases further solidified the stock as a dividend investment. apple has increased its dividend every year since initiating it in 00NUMBER00 averaging about an 00NUMBER00 annual increase. the company increased its quarterly dividend from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 on an annual basis last april. apple management said during the companys most recent earnings call it will announce an update for its capital return program when it reports second fiscal quarter results. therefore investors can expect to hear by how much the company chooses to boost its dividend in april. if apple maintains its current rate of dividend increases the company will announce a dividend of about 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 approximately an 00NUMBER00 hike to the dividend. dividends come easy for apple   as income investors know dividend increases alone arent enough to make a stock enticing as a potential income investment. but fortunately apple possesses several other key characteristics that really drive home the value in the stock as a dividend investment. apple store. image source apple. 00NUMBER00. apples business has staying power. the companys pricing power and its loyal customer base are clear evidence of its powerful and enduring brand. while the company may derive its revenue from a concentrated portfolio of products which is prone to be volatile on a year to year basis the steadiness in apples brand power with its entrenched customer base is a testament to the long term potential for the brand and business. 00NUMBER00. theres plenty of room for dividend growth. currently paying out just 00NUMBER00 of earnings in dividends there is huge room for further dividend increases even if the company struggles to grow eps. or heres another way to look at the wiggle room for apples dividend of apples 00NUMBER00 billion in trailing 00NUMBER00 month free cash flow it paid out just 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends during this same period. 00NUMBER00. share price appreciation is likely too. currently trading with a price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 apple stock trades at a significant discount to the average earnings multiple assigned to stocks in the sp 00NUMBER00. and this multiple is particularly conservative in light of the companys recent growth. during the trailing twelve months apples eps increased 00NUMBER00. in other words not only is apples dividend likely to increase at meaningful rates over the long haul but the stock also appears undervalued. while a 00NUMBER00 dividend yield is fairly small its enticing when viewed in light of the stocks conservative valuation and the dividends potential for further increases. apple stock therefore is a great bet for dividend investors looking for an enduring and growing stream of cash payments. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

  has been in the news for its conflict over encryption and privacy with the government   but its about to be at the center of attention for a very different reason. aapl stock is on the cusp of a very powerful technical breakout of a multi month consolidation range setting the stage for the first major uptrend in apple shares since october. click to enlarge   aapl stock has been on the slide since last summer for a number of reasons. but primarily â€¦however shares recently have pushed above the 00NUMBER00 day moving average around 00NUMBER00. investors are beginning to warm up to the stock ahead of a march 00NUMBER00 product event expected to debut a 00NUMBER00 inch iphone as well as a new ipad lineup. and this is merely a prelude to the big iphone 00NUMBER00 launch later this year. plus its worth remembering the company is pushing ahead of bigger initiatives such as a virtual realityaugmented reality effort as well as the much heralded project titan electric vehicle project. the next earnings report will hit on april 00NUMBER00 after the close. analysts are looking for earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share on revenues 00NUMBER00 billion. if shares can stay above the 00NUMBER00 day moving average as well as price resistance 00NUMBER00 consider all of these events as things that could help propel apple higher to the next line of resistance. already the march 00NUMBER00 aapl calls recommended to edge pro  subscribers are up more than 00NUMBER00 and are poised for huge gains on a possible run at the stocks 00NUMBER00 day moving average. that would be worth

00NUMBER00 for the first time in six weeks and now anxious investors are concerned about whether aapl can hold that level. they neednt worry. for one thing some bullish technicals suggest that the  apple stock  price found a bottom last month. and even if the bottom isnt in just yet it doesnt matter aapl is at bargain basement buy levels. if apple shares trend down again so what thats great news for investors looking to pick up more shares at even deeper discounts. because make no mistake the relative valuation of apple stock makes it a screaming  buy. aapl stock is contending with a number of headwinds these days but none is stiffer than iphone sales. theyre expected to suffer a year over year decline  for the first time in history and the market is freaking out. now to be fair the iphone segment is   apple. thats the business that once drove apple stock to a market cap of more than 00NUMBER00 billion. a bet against aapl is a bet against the company engineering a big iphone comeback with its new fall model. other headwinds include worries that without steve jobs apple cant innovate hits like it used to. theres also a fear that aapl has become so gargantuan that its growth rate will inevitably stall but that has dissipated since apple stocks market cap plummeted by more than 00NUMBER00 billion in the past year. however iphone is the driver of the selloff that began last summer and its this bout of fright that has aapl stock trading on the cheap. the problems with iphone sales have some folks betting that apples days of super sized growth are over. maybe so but weve seen this happen before. the company was struggling with sickly results in the sector before it fixed everything with the iphone 00NUMBER00. when you compare the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus to prior models they werent big hits. but its too soon to conclude that apple has lost its touch. if iphone 00NUMBER00 is a flop its time to revisit the thesis on aapl but were not there yet. the markets premature nerves have more than discounted in the share price anyway. no one values aapl like a growth stock anymore. it changes hands for only 00NUMBER00 times forward earnings. utilities and telecommunications stocks go for more than that and no one mistakes them for fountains of growth. click to enlarge   indeed the forward price to earnings multiple on apple stock offers a discount of nearly 00NUMBER00 to the broader market. its 00NUMBER00 below its own five year average according to thomson reuters stock reports. in addition to the favorable fundamentals apple stock is showing some technical strength. shares hadnt had a whiff of their 00NUMBER00 day moving average for three months and then on wednesday they punched through to the upside. if the apple stock price can make a successful test of that key level theres a good chance the 00NUMBER00 week low notched in february marks the bottom of this protracted drawdown. if the growth rate never rebounds to its glory days the valuation cash flow and cash on the books still makes apple stock too compelling to reject. as of this writing dan burrows did not hold a position in any of the

of robust growth. the decline is generally believed to be some combination of macroeconomic headwinds and a lukewarm reception to the companys newest iphones the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. in a bid to shore up demand for the companys most important product category apple is planning to launch a 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 will be known as the iphone se. lets take a look at what apple reportedly has in store with this soon to be launched device. significant internal upgrades    the iphone se is widely expected to pack apples latest 00NUMBER00 the same one thats found inside of the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus. additionally 00NUMBER00 mark gurman the device will come with an updated wireless subsystem with support for fast 00NUMBER00 wi fi the 00NUMBER00 supports just 00NUMBER00 voice over lte and 00NUMBER00. in addition to the faster connectivity gurman says that the device will include an nfc chip a component required to support apples contactless payment service apple pay. camera upgrades too    both mark gurman as well as kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo claim that apple will include an updated camera subsystem compared to the iphone 00NUMBER00. however there seems to be a disagreement between these two individuals both of whom are quite well connected and reliable so its worth taking a look at what each has to say. according to gurman the iphone se will pack a similar camera subsystem to what the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 came with an updated 00NUMBER00 megapixel rear sensor and a 00NUMBER00 megapixel front facing camera. kuo on the other hand does not appear to give information about the front facing camera but does say  that the iphone ses rear shooter will pack a 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensor likely the same one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. no 00NUMBER00 touch    perhaps the signature feature of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus flagship phones launched back in sept. 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 touch. the feature though quite interesting and challenging technically seems not to have been quite the selling point that apple had hoped. indeed in a poll run by phone arena only 00NUMBER00 of respondents presumably all iphone 00NUMBER00 plus owners said that they use it all the time and 00NUMBER00 said that they use it every now and then. 00NUMBER00 said that they use it simply to show it off to friends and family while a full 00NUMBER00 chose the option whats 00NUMBER00 touchthough a poll on a mobile focused website isnt going to be perfect how do we know that all respondents even own an 00NUMBER00 plus i think that the results seem to suggest that its not really a game changing feature at least not yet. with that in mind the iphone se is expected to come sans 00NUMBER00. on one hand it would seem that this is a sensible move given the seemingly lukewarm reception to the feature and the added cost but on the other one would think that apple would like to push 00NUMBER00 touch adoption as hard as possible. at any rate this is a feature that im sure will come with the next update of the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone whenever that ultimately comes. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies

popular iphone. this began to change in 00NUMBER00 when the idevice maker released both the iphone 00NUMBER00 in place of the prior generation iphone 00NUMBER00 well as the more premium iphone 00NUMBER00. then the company took it a step further in 00NUMBER00 launching not just one premium smartphone but two the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the even more expensive iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. now according to kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo apple is planning to take this a step further with the iphone thats expected to arrive this coming fall. say hello to the iphone pro    the next generation flagship iphone is said to come in three variants. first is the standard iphone 00NUMBER00 with a 00NUMBER00 inch display next is the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and last according to chinese website mydriverscom is the iphone pro. there arent all that many details available for any of these three phones yet but the iphone pro is said to feature a dual lens camera leveraging the technology that the idevice maker got when it acquired privately held linx imaging in 00NUMBER00. this segmentation has some in a tizzy but its just fine    this kind of productfeature segmentation is not sitting well with a number of apple customersenthusiasts. indeed in the various discussion threads at various applecentric websites macrumors appleinsider 00NUMBER00 and so on there are a number of users who take issue with the iphone lineup growing to include so many models. however as some have rightly argued this growth is not only acceptable but in fact necessary  as the iphone matures. the iphone customer base is just gigantic and if the company wants to hold on to those users as well as attract new ones it needs thoughtfully targeted products to serve them all. for example prior to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launches there were people who really  wanted larger iphones. once apple made available not one but two larger iphone sizes iphone sales skyrocketed. although the larger iphones were welcomed by many customers it is not uncommon to see iphone users grumble about how they preferred phones with 00NUMBER00 inch displays. rather than completely ignore the wants of those customers apple is said to be preparing to launch a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone with a very modern set of internal specifications known as the iphone se. on the other side of the spectrum there are those customers who would like to see apple adopt more expensive cutting edge technologies like the dual camera. by introducing a pro iphone tier above the plus apple has more bill of materials headroom to add in interesting albeit costly new features for those willing to pay for them. and given apples iphone average selling prices id say that there are quite a number of apple customers willing to pay more to get more. its a win win for those customers and for apple which should see a boost in average revenue and profit dollars per iphone from sales of such high end products. embrace a wider more diverse lineup of phones    apple is doing the sensible thing by expanding its iphone lineup and i believe that shareholders and customers should wholeheartedly embrace this. i look forward to seeing what interesting features apple has planned for the so called iphone pro. the dual camera alone will make it interesting particularly as this feature promises some nice image quality enhancements though i cant help but wonder if the idevice maker has additional tricks up its sleeve for this ultra premium iphone flagship. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying.

flagship iphones later this year. the devices represent new number devices which means that we can expect a new or enhanced industrial design along with upgrades to critical components such as the display. indeed the idevice maker had long been known for its best in class mobile displays yet displaymates raymond soneira says that its current iphone displays are well behind the display curve. apple has the opportunity to try to regain display leadership with the iphone 00NUMBER00 generation of devices. however after one crucial bit of information about the device was leaked its clear that apples job is going to get a whole lot tougher. a thinner device means a thinner lcd    a report from apple focused blog macotakara corroborates a report from kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo claiming that apples iphone 00NUMBER00 will be a full millimeter thinner than the iphone 00NUMBER00. if this report is accurate apples upcoming device will be extremely thin at just 00NUMBER00 millimeters. key to enabling this thinner device the blog says is a liquid crystal display thats a full millimeter thinner. what this means for the iphone    for the iphone 00NUMBER00 to have a competitive display its going to need to deliver the following improvements to its displayhigher brightness. greater contrast ratio. better color accuracy. higher resolution. achieving these while making the display thinner and more efficient will extremely  difficult and will require what essentially boils down to herculean feats of engineering. should apple sacrifice performance or features for thin    apple is known for its relentless pursuit of thinner devices. apple senior vp of hardware engineering dan riccio said in an interview with charlie rose that at apple every tenth of a millimeter in the companys products is sacred. however it remains to be seen whether apple will be able to achieve the dramatic improvements in the display technology it needs to be competitive while trying to make its devices increasingly thin. if apple can deliver a device that offers best in class display performance then apples pursuit of thin is certainly welcome. however if apple can deliver something that aces rigorous third party display quality tests even while reducing device thickness then thatll be a major achievement for the idevice maker. thinner should get easier with the move to oleds    all of apples iphones to date have used liquid crystal displays. one drawback to lcds is that they require a separate backlight to operate. oled displays which the company is rumored to switch to with the iphone 00NUMBER00 dont require such a backlight. this means that once apple transitions from lcds to oleds it should be able to make its iphones thinner still. well know soon enough    there has been a surprising dearth of technical information pertaining to the next generation iphone display technologies included. however it shouldnt be long before apples component suppliers begin ramping up production of the components that will go into the idevice makers next generation phones. once that production starts i fully expect kgi securities ming chi kuo or some other well connected analyst to catch wind of what these component suppliers are producing. once they do im sure theyll be quite eager to bring that information into the public domain. 00NUMBER00 companies

these lenses could take photos or capture videos at the same time. each of the camera lenses could also be used one at a time to adjust zoom and other aspects of the image on screen. software included on devices would be able to merge photos taken by the two cameras together and zooming in on it wouldnt diminish the quality of the photo. malware   the first bit of software infected with

00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and iphone 00NUMBER00 pro. these devices are expected to be thinner than 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which is a welcome improvement given that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus were actually slightly thicker than their predecessors. however if a new rumor from mac otakara is true then investors and customers alike should brace themselves for a disappointment. thinner but no change to x and y dimensions    one of the major criticisms of the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of phones  and in particular the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models is that relative to many competing devices their physical footprints are frustratingly large. this is due to the fact that the bezels on the iphone 00NUMBER00 phones both on the top and on the sides are quite large. many of apples competitors in contrast have been working to dramatically reduce the size of the bezels on their phones in order to either reduce the footprints of their devices or keep similar footprints but increase display size. per mac otakara the iphone 00NUMBER00 and presumably the 00NUMBER00 plus will retain the same x and y dimensions as the prior generation iphones. what this means for iphone buyers    if this rumor is true then it implies one of two things for the idevice makers next generation iphonethe bezels have gotten smaller and apple has increased the display sizes on the devices orthe next generation iphones will retain their unusually large bezels. unfortunately generally reliable analyst ming chi kuo reportedly said in a note published late last year that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will feature the same 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch display sizes respectively that the prior two generations of iphones have employed. frankly im just hoping that the rumor from mac otakara isnt  true at this point though im not counting on it. according to mac rumors mac otakara is largely accurate making it a widely trusted source for apple product rumors but cautions that the site does share inaccurate info on occasion. not a deal breaker but still disappointing    engineering a mass market product like the iphone is always going to include trade offs so if apple really isnt going to reduce the footprint of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus then theres probably a good engineering reason for doing so. that said i dont think this is the sort of thing thats going to make or break the next generation iphone. as long as apple makes the device more aesthetically pleasing and dramatically improves the key aspects of the device processor display camera and so on then a relatively large footprint isnt likely to have a materially negative impact on demand. its worth noting that kgi securities ming chi kuo leaked many of the iphone 00NUMBER00 details in april 00NUMBER00 and shed quite a lot of light on the iphone 00NUMBER00 in particular leaking that the device would include 00NUMBER00 touch in april 00NUMBER00. indeed with at least one apple supplier beginning pre build activity for the iphone 00NUMBER00 the component selectionspecification for this device is very likely locked down. as more component vendors start their own pre build activity information about what  theyre building is almost certain to leak out sooner rather than later. i expect that investors will learn everything that theyd like to know about the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus within the next month or two so stay tuned. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

image source apple. per barrons   pacific crest analyst andy hargreaves reiterated an overweight rating on shares of apple  stock. however the analyst took his price target down 00NUMBER00 per share to just 00NUMBER00. this target reduction comes as the analyst dims his revenue and profit expectations for the current fiscal year. lets take a closer look at why hes bringing those estimates down and to what theyre being brought to. soft iphone demand    hargreaves reportedly took his iphone unit shipment estimates for the current quarter down from 00NUMBER00 million units to just 00NUMBER00 units. this reduction drove the analyst to reduce his revenue estimate for the current quarter from 00NUMBER00 billion which was already slightly below the midpoint of the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billion range that apple guided to to just 00NUMBER00. can iphone 00NUMBER00 save the day    the analyst reportedly goes on to argue that his team sees no evidence of iphone customers leaving the platform at greater levels the implication here seemingly being that weak iphone demand isnt necessarily due to market segment share loss. hargreaves claims that if this dynamic continues his team continues to believe that normal replacement dynamics will drive mid teens iphone unit growth in the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. generally speaking apple is expected to see iphone shipments for the current fiscal year of somewhere between 00NUMBER00 units and 00NUMBER00 million units anywhere from a 00NUMBER00 to a roughly 00NUMBER00 decline year over year. if we assume that apple comes in at around 00NUMBER00 million units and if we assume 00NUMBER00 growth off of that base were looking at around 00NUMBER00 million units in fiscal 00NUMBER00 which would be an all time record for iphone sales. one thing thatll be interesting to see is how average selling prices for iphone fare in fiscal 00NUMBER00. apple is expected to introduce a super premium iphone pro in the coming product cycle which could help to boost average selling prices. as a potential headwind to average selling prices apple is expected to put out a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se and significantly reduce iphone 00NUMBER00 prices. even if apple returns iphone to growth in 00NUMBER00 can it repeat it in 00NUMBER00 interesting but not all that surprising that the 00NUMBER00 plus cycle has proven to be something of a bust for the idevice maker. it was silly to try to follow up what was surely a blockbuster record smashing iphone and ceo tim cook seemed to know  that they would be so ahead of time with phones that looked practically the same with minimal improvements to the camera and display. indeed apple seems to have bet this product cycle on 00NUMBER00 and from the tepid demand for iphones it doesnt look like that bet was a winning one. at any rate even if the iphone 00NUMBER00 returns the iphone business to unitrevenue growth apple is going to need to make sure that the follow on s cycle brings compelling enough improvements to keep the momentum going. for apples sake the company should examine very carefully why the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle has been a bust and what it can do to avoid a repeat of it in future product cycles. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

new rumor claims that apple will introduce 00NUMBER00 inch iphone as early as 00NUMBER00 reports the motley fool. according to this rumor the tech company could introduce a 00NUMBER00 inch iphone in 00NUMBER00 that will be equipped with an amoled display. the rumor claims that this new device might not be released until 00NUMBER00 but that suppliers will be able to provide amoled displays for 00NUMBER00 million smartphones during its first year. the largest iphone currently available has a screen size of 00NUMBER00 inches. the post tuesday apple rumors 00NUMBER00 inch iphone may 00NUMBER00 first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. there arent too many levers that apple  has left to pull in order to jump start iphone unit sales. but prominent and fairly accurate apple analyst ming chi kuo thinks that apple could be about to do the unthinkable slash the iphone 00NUMBER00 price by a whopping 00NUMBER00. thats in addition  to the rumored 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se that is expected to be unveiled at a press event later this month. that doesnt sound like apple. its a fire. . . sale. the new iphone se is said to be priced in the range of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 which would occupy whats typically been apples lowest official price point. right now the iphone 00NUMBER00 initially released in 00NUMBER00 sits at that price. but a 00NUMBER00 reduction would bring that all the way down to 00NUMBER00. the lowest that apple has ever been willing to go in the u. s. has been 00NUMBER00 and while it may make some sense to still offer the iphone 00NUMBER00 at a lower price dropping the price so substantially doesnt make much sense even if the 00NUMBER00 cost curve is extremely cheap and apple could turn a reliable profit. of course the broader implications of a 00NUMBER00 iphone would be potential unit growth while average selling prices suffer. although in some regards apple could afford a hit to asp since the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus are driving asps to record 00NUMBER00 last quarter. but it still doesnt make any sense to go that low. apple isnt that desperate. when kuo loses his edge    relatively speaking kuo has demonstrated a fairly accurate track record when it comes to apple rumors. but most of the time thats related to hardware specs and other information that can be uncovered through supply chain leaks. in contrast pricing is a little harder to predict since its a strategic discussion that takes place mostly in cupertino. that also applies to branding which is why its a bit harder to find clues as to what apple may or may not call a certain device. interestingly enough sometimes the most reliable branding leaks come from leaked images of product packaging which is physical evidence like other hardware leaks. pricing is very  hard to predict because there is no physical evidence as to what cook co. are thinking. thats why the iphone 00NUMBER00 name was tipped by leaked product packaging pricing took everyone by surprise in 00NUMBER00 when apple announced the plastic iphone would cost 00NUMBER00 while investors were expecting it to be more affordable. maybe one day    to be clear iphone unit volumes do look like theyre peaking but the real question is whether or not apple feels investor pressure to grow units while sacrificing brand strength. i personally think apples business is just fine in terms of units and cash flow but investors are still unwilling  to give apple reasonable valuation multiples. demanding unit growth may not be worth it if it comes at the price of lower asps compressed margins and a compromised brand that hurts pricing power. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. ill be honest i dont expect much from apple  these days. and coming from the fools long standing resident and admittedly biased apple bull that should mean something. dont get me wrong i dont think apples story is over nor do i think the business is deteriorating. rather ive tempered my expectations about how apple may perform going forward. the company has fallen into a predictable cadence in terms of how its products will evolve and even the new product categories that apple has entered only look modestly promising. its tough to beat the iphones financial results and there should be little doubt that the smartphone market is maturing. for instance apple watch 00NUMBER00 doesnt seem particularly promising in terms of catalyzing upgrades although maybe it can help with broader smartwatch adoption numbers. check your expectations at the door    gone are the days when investors could expect market thumping returns from the mac maker. instead consider other consumer staples that merely match the broader markets performance but also pay reliable dividends that increase on an annual basis. take a minute to appreciate that statement though. its an impressive feat in itself that apple has turned a 00NUMBER00 into a product that is regularly upgraded and can reliably generate recurring revenue. consumer staples typically include things like laundry detergent band aids over the counter painkillers beverages or other items you pick up at the grocery store without much thought. yet were talking about a 00NUMBER00 smartphone that quite a few people upgrade regularly either every year or every two years instead of 00NUMBER00 that you buy every other week. consumer staples stocks are among the favorite holdings of many investors. they might not outperform the market most years but theyre also unlikely to underperform  the market too. with mature consumer staples companies investors look for consistent cash flow above all else in part to sustain the dividend payouts. and apple has cash flow in spades. time to rebalance    all that being said i plan on being a long term apple shareholder for the foreseeable future. over the years apple has grown to become a disproportionately large holding in our family portfolio although a particular electric auto maker recently overtook apple as our largest holding   due to its astronomical rise in recent years. but im a growth investor through and through. im fairly young have a long time horizon and a high risk tolerance. so for these reasons im likely to rebalance my own personal portfolio and diversify away from apple in line with the motley fools disclosure and trading policies   of course. i simply dont consider apple a growth stock anymore in part because ive lost confidence  in the broader markets willingness to assign apple better than market valuation multiples. its been a fun ride ive owned apple for precisely a decade but its now time to turn my attention to a newer model. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the

apple aapl will hold its next special event on march 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. apple’s special events are closely watched as it is one day when the otherwise secretive company reveals new products features and more. for the upcoming event there is already speculation about the products apple could unveil. the tech giant is supposedly gearing up for the launch of a new ipad a smaller sized iphone and some accessories for the apple watch like newer wristbands. lets take a closer look. ipadapple’s current ipad and macbook lineup includesipad pro 00NUMBER00 inchipad air 00NUMBER00

and 00NUMBER00 inchas reported apple is expected to launch a new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro which would have almost identical features as the bigger sized model. it is likely to use the 00NUMBER00 third generation chip like in the 00NUMBER00 inch diagonal length retina display ipad pro 00NUMBER00 inch and will also include technology that supports apple pencil which expands the versatility of multi touch. it is further said that the smaller ipad pro is likely to have the same storage capacity and color options as the bigger one. during 00NUMBER00 apple reported a sale of 00NUMBER00 million units of ipad and the contribution to overall revenue was 00NUMBER00. iphoneapple is also rumored to introduce a 00NUMBER00 inch iphone which is likely to replace the iphone 00NUMBER00. while the name ‘iphone 00NUMBER00 is being tossed around it may be different at the time of the launch. the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone is assumed to be internally revamped version of 00NUMBER00 with some features of iphone 00NUMBER00. the new model is likely to have an improved camera with support for live photos like whats currently available with the 00NUMBER00 as well as the nfc chip to support apple pay. the iphone continued to be apple’s star product as per 00NUMBER00 earnings report. apple inc. sold 00NUMBER00 million units of iphone during 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 almost equivalent to the sales during the same quarter in the previous year. as a trend the 00NUMBER00 sales usually tend to be the best of the four quarters as they represent the holidays and festive sales. the sales in 00NUMBER00 have been lower than 00NUMBER00 in the previous years and the same pattern is expected in fiscal 00NUMBER00 as well. the iphone sales generated a revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion which is 00NUMBER00 of apple’s overall revenue. apple watchwhile apple is believed to be working on a new version apple watch 00NUMBER00 of its debut wearable product the same is not expected to be launched this month. however following the partnership between apple and hermès the company is expected to focus on new bands and software as per 00NUMBER00. apple has been tight lipped about the sale figures of its apple watch which was launched in march 00NUMBER00. according to canalys estimates “apple dominated the smart watch market in 00NUMBER00 accounting for over 00NUMBER00 million units and two thirds of all shipments. ”according to international data corporation idc estimates shipment of apple watch was at 00NUMBER00 million units in 00NUMBER00 with a market share of 00NUMBER00 behind fitbit. given the fast expanding wearable device market apple watch will be an important product for the company’s revenue in the future. final wordthere is always a lot of excitement among apple loyalists about its products and launches. in fact anticipation about apple’s world wide developers conference scheduled sometime in june and september event which is likely to unveil iphone 00NUMBER00 is already high. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source fiat. the automotive industry has been less than receptive to rumors that apple  is building its own electric car. last year general motors  icon bob lutz said apple has no experience. theres no reason to assume apple will do a better job than general motors ford   volkswagen   toyota   or hyundai. i think this is going to be a gigantic money pit. tesla motors   outspoken ceo elon musk has offered both positive and negative feelings about apples foray into autos saying that apples entry will expand the industry but also noting that when tesla fires an engineer they go to apple. if you dont make it at tesla you go work at apple. im not kidding he said in the past. the disdain some automakers have for apple became more apparent recently with comments from fiat chrysler   ceo sergio marchionne. at the recent geneva auto show marchionne said this about apples car plansif they have any urges to make a car id advise them to lie down and wait until the feeling passes. illnesses like this come and go you will recover from them theyre not lethal. i highly doubt marchionne is just looking out for apples best interests. its more likely that fiat chrysler simply isnt too keen on the idea of more competition in the already competitive automotive space. sticks and stones    this of course will do little to dissuade apple. its likely the automakers are just a bit paranoid of what a full fledged apple car might look like though i doubt tesla is very worried considering its lead in the electric vehicle space. ill admit ive had my doubts about apple being able to pull off its so called project titan car. i wrote about my skepticism   last year but even im starting to come around. despite some news over the past few months that apple lost some project titan executives to other companies apple appears to be on course  for its 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 car release date. the latest apple car news is that the company is leasing a former pepsi factory that silicon valley business journal  says could be used for electric vehicle research. that factory adds to about three or four other locations that are speculated to be research and development sites for apples car. of course apples been quiet about its possible car plans but even its ceo tim cook is commenting a bit more about it these days. at its annual shareholder meeting last month an investor asked cook about an apple car. cook responded by saying do you remember when you were a kid and christmas eve was so exciting you werent sure what was going on downstairs well its going to be christmas eve for a while. thats probably not the answer the investor or any of us wanted but its still a much more positive picture than the automakers are painting about apples plans and its probably much more accurate too. a secret billion dollar stock

in 00NUMBER00 the marketing tag line was bigger than bigger. in characteristic apple fashion the implication was that the iphones jump to a bigger form factor was more significant than just a spec change. the expected move did  do wonders for unit sales though. apple posted a massive jump in iphone units in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 that there was considerable pent up demand for a larger iphone. data source sec filings. furthermore ceo tim cook shared some relevant data on the last earnings conference call saying that 00NUMBER00 of customers who had an iphone prior to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus still had not upgraded yet to the larger displays. assuming that a meaningful portion of those customers end up upgrading theres still plenty of opportunity  in the current 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch models. but apple might be about to go bigger again. fellow fool ashraf eassa obtained  a pre publication note from digitimes  suggesting that apple is planning on including a 00NUMBER00 inch amoled display in the 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 iphone. as usual ashraf offers his take on the technical aspects but what other strategic implications are there for the mac makerrumor has it    like all apple rumors particularly those that are farther in the future there are more questions than answers. the most important is how a 00NUMBER00 inch amoled iphone would be priced and positioned. theres already talk that the most expensive 00NUMBER00 plus later this year might have a single lens variant alongside a dual lens camera. if apple does go that route and essentially charges a higher price for the dual lens model that would be a new precedent of offering different configurations beyond storage within a single iphone model which the company has never done before. we dont know what this possible dual lens option could cost at this point but rest assured it will be in line with apples broader margin profile. note that the storage pricing structure that apple implemented in 00NUMBER00 has translated into impressive increases in asps. apple is quite good at upselling commodity components since theyre deeply integrated into the device. amoled displays also cost more than the lcd panels that apple currently uses especially since apple buys them from third party suppliers while rivals like samsung  are vertically integrated. samsung is expectedly in the running as a potential amoled panel supplier. that suggests that apple would likely pass on those added costs to consumers in the form of an upsell. would apple also keep its 00NUMBER00 inch iphone around and sell 00NUMBER00 inch model as well that might justify the upsell more since the customer also gets a larger display but one of apples key strengths has always been product depth instead of product breadth. id hate for apples product portfolio to swell unnecessarily since that only creates distractions with negligible market benefits. a secret billion dollar

remove the headphone jack from its upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 but its never been confirmed. the switch in this case could mean that the change will happen but case makers dont have exact details of the device and are likely making educated guesses. home   apple may uses liquidmetal for home buttons on future devices   reports appleinsider. this new information was revealed in a patent that was filed by the company. it describes replacing the current home button assembly with one containing liquidmetal. this would give the home button more elasticity and could open up a system similar to force touch for it. it would also simplify the buttons design and could reduce risk of it breaking as easily. the post wednesday apple rumors possible iphone 00NUMBER00 case missing headphone jack

expected to launch a new 00NUMBER00 inch smartphone dubbed the iphone se later this month. the device is expected to be fairly high end particularly as it is expected to feature many of the same internals including applications processor of the relatively new iphone 00NUMBER00. one feature it is expected to be missing though is 00NUMBER00. the exclusion of this feature is likely for a couple of reasons. the first is that the additional components required to add 00NUMBER00 touch tack on cost and that may simply reduce margins by too much particularly on a low cost device. secondly apple likely wants to give customers a reason to buy up to the higher priced iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. although i understand apples reasoning and it probably makes sense from a near term financial and business perspective i still believe that apple should have endowed the se with 00NUMBER00 touch. its mostly about the app ecosystem    apple has done a generally good job of making sure the core apps that come preinstalled on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus offer 00NUMBER00 support. this situation is only expected to improve with the upcoming release of ios 00NUMBER00. however in order for 00NUMBER00 touch to truly be a game changing feature one that drives customers to want to upgrade to newer iphones its going to need to see very widespread and meaningful adoption by major software developers. now to be fair 00NUMBER00 touch enabled devices are already out there in the tens of millions and once the iphone 00NUMBER00 drops and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus waterfall to lower price points 00NUMBER00 capable phones will be more than ubiquitous. this is likely to be incentive enough for most developers with deep pockets. however apple is probably going to sell a good number of these updated iphone se phones particularly to customers who simply prefer to have a premium smartphone experience in a compact form factor. in fact one analyst with rbc capital believes that the iphone se will add a full 00NUMBER00 billion in incremental sales to the companys top line this fiscal year and 00NUMBER00 per share in net income. thats a non trivial number of small iphones set to be sold to current and potentially new apple customers coupled with the fact that a relatively low proportion of the overall pre iphone 00NUMBER00 plus installed base has upgraded to newer phones about 00NUMBER00 per the most recent earnings call smaller developers might simply be uninterested in supporting 00NUMBER00 touch until it is more ubiquitous. beyond the app ecosystem argument    in addition to the app ecosystem argument theres also the simple fact that apple spent a significant amount of time touting 00NUMBER00 touch as the  killer new feature in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. in fact of the roughly 00NUMBER00 hour that apple spent at its fall event talking about the new iphones a full 00NUMBER00 minutes were spent on extolling the virtues of 00NUMBER00 touch. it just seems strange for the idevice maker to launch a new premium tier phone without this key feature. in fact i think thats the main problem that i have with the upcoming iphone se. if the device doesnt have a trick or an interesting selling point beyond the fact that its smaller and a bit cheaper than the iphone 00NUMBER00 then i dont see it as a device that can help apple gain all that much share. at best it will be a device that should convince those owners of oldersmaller iphones to finally upgrade if they had been holding out for a newer compact device. perhaps thats the real job of the iphone se a fairly easy way to leverage preexisting technologies in order to grab as much incremental revenue as possible until the iphone 00NUMBER00 show up to help boost iphone sales performance. 00NUMBER00

herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. professor aswath damodaran of stern school of business at new york university is one of the leading world experts in corporate valuation and according to his calculations apple  stock is considerably undervalued. in fact the professor believes apple could be worth 00NUMBER00 per share  under conservative assumptions. thats an upside potential of about 00NUMBER00 from current price levels. these kinds of calculations always depend on multiple forecasts and assumptions and even the most renowned valuation experts can make mistakes. for this reason investors should always do their own homework as opposed to blindly relying on the work of others no matter how renowned and prestigious. on the other hand it makes sense to take a look at the numbers behind damodarans calculations and try to understand what they mean for investors in  apple stock. the rationale behind the numbers    its of utmost importance to pay close attention to the assumptions behind a valuation estimate. there is a popular acronym in computer science and mathematics gigo. it stands for garbage in garbage out which basically means that the quality of the conclusion or answer you get depends on the quality of the data you start with. if the assumptions behind a valuation model are wrong then the valuations it produces will also be wrong. importantly we can also analyze these assumptions to understand what kind of scenario is being discounted in current stock prices. professor damodaran is using some fairly conservative assumptions to value apple stock. he estimates that apple will generate revenue growth of 00NUMBER00 annually over the coming five years and that this growth rate will slow down to 00NUMBER00 in his terminal value calculation 00NUMBER00 years from now. operating margins are also forecast to decline from 00NUMBER00 of revenue to 00NUMBER00 of sales over a decade and the cost of capital to fall from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 as the business matures over time. these figures assume that apple is stable and mature corporation and that its revenue growth will be roughly in line with inflation meaning that apple does not offer much potential for above average growth in the future. in a nutshell even assuming that apple is a slow growth corporation and that profit margins will decline in the coming years the stock is attractively priced at current levels. what this means for investors in apple stock   professor damodaran is kind enough to make his valuation spreadsheets freely available on his website so investors can change some of the assumptions and see how the valuation value changes in response. just for fun i assumed that revenue growth rates over the coming five years would be 00NUMBER00 as opposed to 00NUMBER00 and that operating margins will remain stable over this period as opposed to slowly declining. those assumptions yield a valuation estimate of 00NUMBER00 per share. apple could in fact deliver financial performances either above or below forecasts over the years ahead. however i believe there is a higher chance that the company will outperform these forecasts. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus were explosive successes for apple last year customers were avidly attracted to the new models with larger screens and apple registered a big sales increase of 00NUMBER00 during the fiscal year that ended in september. since the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus didnt feature big changes compared to their predecessor models year over year sales comparisons for apple are quite challenging in the middle term. apple registered a modest increase in revenue of less than 00NUMBER00 the december 00NUMBER00 quarter. even worse management is expecting total sales during the march 00NUMBER00 quarter to be in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion which would represent a decline of 00NUMBER00 at the midpoint versus the same quarter last year. on the other hand according to management nearly 00NUMBER00 of all iphone users have not yet upgraded to the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00. their devices are getting increasingly outdated over time and apple users are notoriously loyal to the  brand. its not too unreasonable to expect sales to re accelerate  as more customers get around to upgrading their devices in the coming years. apple is also entering new categories with products and services such as apple watch apple pay and apple music. the company still makes almost 00NUMBER00 of its revenue from the iphone but other products and services should contribute a growing share of overall sales in the coming years. as a reference apple reported a big increase of 00NUMBER00 in sales from its services segment last quarter accounting for 00NUMBER00 of total revenue during the period. whether apple can jump start growth in the coming years remains to be seen but one thing looks quite clear apple stock is attractively valued nowadays even if growth remains subdued. this puts investors in a remarkably comfortable position if revenue growth remains stagnant then this is already incorporated into valuation and the stock is in fact very reasonable priced for such scenario. on the other hand if the company can accelerate performance on the back of improving iphone sales andor growing revenues from other businesses then the stock should offer considerable upside potential. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot

be exact. heres what to expect as well as how to tune in. likely announcements  iphone se  the most prevalent rumors ahead of apples event later this month are surrounding a new iphone. but dont expect the 00NUMBER00. speculation points to a new phone apple has reportedly dubbed the iphone se. with the event scheduled about halfway between the companys typical iphone launches the se is rumored to replace the companys iphone 00NUMBER00 with an improved device but at the same price. rendering of what iphone se could look like by macrumors   used with permission. the phone is expected to keep the 00NUMBER00 inch size of the 00NUMBER00. this is smaller than the companys iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 devices which have 00NUMBER00 inch displays. internals too are expected to be upgraded. among other expected improvements the phone will reportedly adopt apples 00NUMBER00 processor currently in the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus. a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro  rumors suggest apple may introduce an ipad air sized ipad pro. what is an ipad pro last november apple began selling its first ipad with a display larger than 00NUMBER00 inches called an ipad pro. starting at 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 higher than the starting price of its ipad air 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00 inch device included significantly more utility than the ipad air 00NUMBER00. for instance the ipad pro was compatible with the new apple pencil and apples smart keyboard. this new ipad pro could simply be a smaller version of its larger counterpart. apple watch bands  apple is also expected to introduce new apple watch bands. but with third party sellers already crowding the market for apple watch bands investors will likely be less interested in new band designs. apple watch. image source apple. potential but unlikely announcements   new macs  as macrumors notes   the time is right for mac updates but there have been no rumors confirming that is the case. but what about a new apple watch with the event being just under a year after apple began selling its apple watch some investors might expect the company to introduce new versions of the smartwatch during the event. but the consensus in the ever active apple rumor mill is that apple watch hardware wont be updated until later this year. of course apple could introduce other products or services not listed here. the company is known for its secrecy and the tech giant likely tries to keep as much information about new products and services from the public eye as possible ahead of their debuts. further even if the apple rumor mill is right about apple planning to introduce these products plans could always change at the last minute. the rumored iphone se will likely be the most important product for investors to watch. in apples most recent quarter iphone sales accounted for 00NUMBER00 of revenue. any new product in this segment even if its not a flagship device has potential to move the needle for the company. apple will be making a live stream of the event available online. beginning at 00NUMBER00 am pt on march 00NUMBER00 investors can watch the event at this page on apples website   or on apple

advice trading tipsapple inc. aapl    typically holds an iphone event once a year in september announcing its latest and greatest models. to say that these events are watched closely by investors reporters tech nerds and pop culture enthusiasts alike is an understatement. they are a legitimate phenomenon. there are a few reasons behind the hype theyre rare they often unveil new features that surprise and impress us and they have profound implications for the future of apple and the aapl stock price. about two thirds of apples revenue currently comes from the iphone so if its next smartphone looks like it could be a dud investors need to know. but apple is departing from its normal release cycle and is expected to announce new iphone and ipad models on march 00NUMBER00. obviously this dilutes the rarity of the annual iphone event … but could it be worth it given whats currently going on at apple and what the tech community expects from the event i think the decision should be a definite positive for  apple stock. its no secret that aapl stock is in desperate need of a catalyst. apple is down 00NUMBER00 in the last year making shareholders who are used to exceptional returns year after year quite jittery. so what can investors expect from the march 00NUMBER00 always comes up with some cheeky little phrase that it slaps on invites to its announcement events. usually it contains some hint of what the event will discuss. last march apple sent out invites to an event that would unveil the apple watch with the text spring forward. clever. this year the invites say let us loop you in. while the speculation over what that might mean is far from exciting  the verge  thinks it could portend the comeback of the lanyard loop  that the ipod touch used to have the details of the new iphone should have anyone with a stake in apple excited. tim cook and his team are expected to show off a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone dubbed the iphone se that will be a mixture of the iphone 00NUMBER00 physique and the iphone 00NUMBER00 features. additionally the new ipad is also expected to be a smaller 00NUMBER00 inch version that may be an extension of the ipad pro line. and as the verge  also points out that means that apple will unveil   a much more powerful 00NUMBER00 inch ipad than what apple currently has on sale. it also means some interesting things for the air line should apple really launch this one under the pro name it cements a clear division between apples high end and low end tablets. if true i think both releases should be net positives for aapl stock. theres definitely latent demand out there for a smaller iphone we havent seen a 00NUMBER00 inch model since 00NUMBER00 and many americans have trump like hands incapable of comfortably utilizing larger sized phones. as for the clear delineation between the ipad air and ipad pro lines hopefully that will help prevent some cannibalism and maybe even help revive the languishing ipad segment which tim cook has suggested will be revived soon. well have to wait another 00NUMBER00 days to see. hopefully the whole loop concept is a little more exciting than a lanyard but im not optimistic. the big news here will be how both of these products are received  after   the event and given the markets need for a smaller iphone in particular i think apple stock holders will end up cheering the move in the months ahead. as of this writing john divine did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. you can follow him on twitter at  divinebizkid  or email him at

will go higher and bearish means that an investor believes a stock will go down or underperform. however bullish can mean different things  especially for short term and long term traders. bullish short term trading    if a short term trader is bullish he or she believes that a stock will go up in the coming days weeks or even minutes. this may be based on analyzing stock charts or intraday volume and price action. in these cases the bullish viewpoint has nothing to do with the underlying company for instance if a trader believes a stock is oversold he may buy shares in the hopes of a quick reversal. other short term traders are bullish because theyre betting that some near term event will happen in a favorable manner. for example a trader may buy a stock the day before its quarterly earnings are released hoping that the company will beat expectations. bullish long term trading    when an investor is bullish for the long term it means that he or she has a favorable view of the companys future andor believes that the stock is undervalued at the current share price. for example if you think that apple  is cheap at 00NUMBER00 times ttm earnings and that the company will continue to dominate the market in its key product areas we could say that youre bullish on  apple stock. bullish on the market or economy    sometimes the term is used to describe the entire stock market or economy. for example you may read that a certain economist has a bullish view on the stock market in 00NUMBER00 which means that this individual believes the market will rise this year. or if you have a bullish view of the u. s. economy means you believe there will be significant gdp growth and other positive economic developments. just like stocks bullish views on the entire stock market or economy can be of the short term or long term variety. similarly a bull market  refers to when the overall stock market has a sustained upward trend generally lasting for several years. the period 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 can be characterized as a bull market. the 00NUMBER00 social security bonus most retirees completely overlook   if youre like most americans youre a few years or more behind on your retirement savings. but a handful of little known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. in fact one marketwatch reporter argues that if more americans knew about this the government would have to shell out an extra 00NUMBER00 billion annually. for example one easy 00NUMBER00 minute trick could pay you as much as 00NUMBER00 more. . . each

smartphone vendor xiaomi announced a new flagship smartphone known as the 00NUMBER00 at mobile world congress late last month. the device like many of xiaomis flagship devices is notable because it packs a lot of top tier hardware specifications in a relatively low cost package. the purpose of this article isnt to talk about the 00NUMBER00 per se. rather i believe that the 00NUMBER00 might offer an important clue as to what display technology we may see in apple  s upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00. could the 00NUMBER00 be the first implementation of jdis pixel eyes 00NUMBER00 earlier columns i noted that apple could very well be planning to use second generation pixel eyes in cell touch displays from japan display which went into mass production at the end of 00NUMBER00. these new displays per the japan based display manufacturer offer a number of important advantages over first generation pixel eyes displays such as improved contrast ratio narrower display borders reduced thickness and so on. according to xiaomi via anandtech the 00NUMBER00 display offers up a number of interesting characteristics. the display itself apparently sports a high contrast ratio of 00NUMBER00 thin side bezels quite high brightness the ability to change contrast ratio on a per pixel basis in real time and a wide color gamut 00NUMBER00 of ntsc well beyond the typical 00NUMBER00 coverage. i would not be surprised at all if the 00NUMBER00 were packing a second generation pixel eyes display from japan display given the reported characteristics. if so expect big improvements in the iphone 00NUMBER00 lcd    to the best of my knowledge apple does not use off the shelf displays rather it would appear that apple has a fairly large team of experts that works closely with display manufacturers to build displays exclusively for apple. that said i do believe that the interesting features that xiaomi introduced with the 00NUMBER00 display represent a baseline  for what to expect from the iphone 00NUMBER00 display. in particular look for brightness to go up the color gamut to be widened significantly and for contrast ratio to move upward apples current displays are already where the 00NUMBER00 display is. i also fully expect that apple will implement a real time contrast ratio adjustment scheme in the iphone 00NUMBER00 as xiaomi has with the 00NUMBER00. the new display could be quite eye catching    one of the problems that i believe apple is facing during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle is that many iphone 00NUMBER00 buyers and iphone users who held off on buying a 00NUMBER00 plus didnt see an immediate and obvious difference between the old iphone 00NUMBER00 and the new iphone 00NUMBER00 models. the industrial designs being similar didnt help nor did the fact that the display panels seem to be unchanged year over year. with the enhancements to the display discussed above coupled with a move to higher resolution and thus sharper displays on both the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 pluspro the generation on generation improvements should be immediately obvious to anybody who tries the new devices in a retail store. that coupled with an all new industrial design a much improved camera subsystem and other as of year unknown goodies could make the iphone 00NUMBER00 the product that puts iphone back on a growth path. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable

an image that supposedly reveals what the upcoming apple  iphone 00NUMBER00 will look like. in the image below which hemmerstoffer posted to twitter a little while ago we see a 00NUMBER00 on the left and a mockup based on the rendering on the rightimage credit steve hemmerstoffer  stagueve. from this image we can get a good sense of some of the changesimprovements that apple plans to bring to its next generation iphone. lets dig deeper. significantly reduced antenna lines smaller camera bump    as macrumors  reported earlier the iphone 00NUMBER00 is expected to see the removal of the antenna lines that run across the back of the device. instead the phone is expected to just have antenna lines running along the top and bottom as shown in the rendering as well as the mockup. in an article published on nowhereelse. fr hemmerstoffer notes that there seems to be a slight bulge for the camera which contradicts previous reports that the rear camera will sit flush with the back of the device. speaking of the camera. . . hemmerstoffer points out that the opening for the camera in the rear shell of the device is larger than the one found on either the iphone 00NUMBER00 or the iphone 00NUMBER00. i strongly suspect that this is due to the fact that apple will be including a camera module that includes a larger sensor with a commensurately larger lens suggesting a wider maximum aperture for better low light photos. it also stands to reason that we will see apple stick with a 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensor but that this sensor will feature significantly larger pixels. how about thickness    a previous report from kgi securities ming chi kuo suggested that apple aims to make the iphone 00NUMBER00 its thinnest ever at between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 millimeters in thickness. the source of the leak apparently told hemmerstoffer that the iphone 00NUMBER00 would be slightly thinner than the current generation iphone 00NUMBER00. given that the iphone 00NUMBER00 measures in at 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick slightly thinner would seem to imply a thickness more at the high end of kuos range than at the low end. however its worth keeping in mind that mac otakara a fairly reliable source of apple related leaks recently claimed that apple would be shaving at least a full millimeter off with the 00NUMBER00 relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00. more is surely to come    the leaked image apparently came from metal casing maker catcher technologies which mass produces metal casings for many of apples idevices. if apple is really sending the final schematics to catcher for mass production then this strongly suggests that the iphone 00NUMBER00 design is set in stone and ready for mass production. i wouldnt be surprised if the other vendors in the iphone 00NUMBER00 chain are also beginning mass production of the components that will power this next generation iphone. with the design finalized and components beginning to be produced by the millions it surely wont be long now before investors learn the key specifications of the next generation iphone. for the sake of apple and its shareholders it had better be one heck of a phone. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to

todaypanorama   apple    aapl    has been granted a patent that could help iphone owners take panoramic photos   00NUMBER00. the patent talks about a system that would use the optical image stabilization to capture panoramic shot with only one tap of the screen. it would do this by deliberately moving the camera to capture images to the left and right of the main photo. these images would then be put together by the smartphone which would automatically give the users the panoramic shot. photo   what could be the first image of apples iphone 00NUMBER00 has been shared online   macrumors notes. the image of the smartphone shows off what could be the dual lens camera system that rumors claim the company would add to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. however the cameras in the image are surrounded by a pill shape that juts out from the back of the device. previous rumors and mock ups have had the cameras sitting flush with the rear case. the image also shows three small dots at the bottom that may be for a smart connector. 00NUMBER00 new rumor claims that apple is working on a promo for the iphone se that includes 00NUMBER00 footage   reports appleinsider. if this rumor turns out to be true it would likely mean that the iphone se will come equipped with a camera thats able to capture 00NUMBER00 footage. this would put the smaller 00NUMBER00 inch iphones camera on par with the one found in the larger iphone 00NUMBER00. previous rumors have claimed that the device would only get modest upgrades but some also suggested that 00NUMBER00 an option for the smartphone.

and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  as every dividend investor knows theres more to a dividend than its current dividend yield. another key area to look at is a dividends growth potential. and its on this front that apple  s dividend stands out. since the tech giant initiated its dividend in 00NUMBER00 its split adjusted quarterly dividend payment has increased from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 and similar rates of dividend hikes look poised to continue over over the long haul. this growth potential makes apples uninspiring 00NUMBER00 yield with shares trading at 00NUMBER00 more enticing that it might initially seem. iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone generates more cash for apples business than any other product. image source apple. huge room for increases    why should investors expect apple to continue increasing 00NUMBER00. apple has more cash than it can spend. on apples balance sheet the company has 00NUMBER00 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities or about 00NUMBER00 per share. this is significant considering apple trades at 00NUMBER00 at the time of this writing. then theres apples annual free cash flow or cash from operations less capital expenditures of 00NUMBER00 billion. at the rate apple is currently paying out dividends its going to take a while for the company to begin making a dent in its cash rich balance sheet. during the trailing 00NUMBER00 months apple paid out 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends. while this is large in absolute terms it represents just 00NUMBER00 of its free cash flow. theres plenty of room therefore for further dividend increases in the future. 00NUMBER00. management has promised annual increases. since initiating its dividend in 00NUMBER00 apple has promised at least two times to continue to increase its dividend on an annual basis. the first time was in 00NUMBER00 when the company said in its press release about its dividend increase that year that it plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis. apple ceo tim cook promised yet again during the companys annual shareholder meeting earlier this year to boost the companys dividend annually. what could apples dividend growth look like    given that apple is currently paying out just 00NUMBER00 of its free cash flow and only about 00NUMBER00 of its net income in dividends theres no reason the company couldnt keep up its current annual rate of dividend increases over the next five years. currently apple is averaging an 00NUMBER00 dividend increase every year. if apple were to maintain this annual rate of dividend increases its total annual payout of quarterly dividends would increase from 00NUMBER00 in calendar 00NUMBER00 to about 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. data for chart retrieved from sec filings for quarters shown. chart source author. a dividend payment this high by 00NUMBER00 would represent a 00NUMBER00 from todays levels. and annual dividends at this level would represent a 00NUMBER00 yield on todays cost basis. further if this scenario were to play out as outlined here apples total annual dividend payout in 00NUMBER00 would only represent about 00NUMBER00 of the companys current  annual free cash flow. in other words even if apples free cash flow stagnates at current levels and never grows any higher the company could easily continue increasing its dividend at double digit rates for years to come. apple might not be a high yielding dividend stock but its dividends growth potential makes it a solid bet for income investors. apple plans to announce a dividend increase in april when management reports its second quarter results. the stupid simple way to score a 00NUMBER00 dividend    theres nothing better than cold hard cash. thats why the savviest

inc. aapl    stock may be on the verge of a trade worthy breakout. better still should this particular breakout take hold with apple shares still down 00NUMBER00 from its 00NUMBER00 triple top level near 00NUMBER00 the upside potential is substantial. the flipside of course is that aapl stock is starting this bullish effort at a bit of a disadvantage which may well come back to haunt it sooner or later. whatever the case whether youre a fan of apple and shopping around for the right entry point or just looking for a near term trading idea and dont care what it is the current  apple stock  chart is worth a closer look just for academic reasons. ever heard of a cup and handle pattern its an old school idea popularized at a time when the market wasnt a complete roll of the dice and chart patterns still meant something. thing is this is one of those old school ideas thats still relevant because the underlying psychology hasnt changed. that psychology is traders stand ready to create a healthy turnaround but are waiting for that last piece of evidence that the turnaround is taking hold. a cup and handle pattern looks like what it sounds like … a sideprofile view of a coffee cup with a handle jutting out to the latter side of it. aapl stock has been developing one of these patterns since early this year and as of tuesday it sealed the deal. take a look. the only real flaw with this particular cup and handle pattern is the brim line of the cup the one on the left isnt at the same level as the one on the right. even so the bullish thrust completing the outside of the handle has cleared eitherboth of those brim lines red completing the pattern and setting up a trade worthy move. there is one possible flaw with the cup and handle pattern apple stock has just dished out however. while the bullish move that completed the handle broke above the brim line as it needed to in order to get the rally going it also left behind a gap between mondays high and tuesdays close. broadly speaking the market doesnt like to leave gaps unfilled. it remains to be seen if investors will let this gap go. of course just because traders tend to fill gaps in doesnt mean aapl will fill this one on right away. it could still happen weeks if not months from now. while the cup and handle pattern is worth noting even if only as an object lesson it should be noted that the pattern has materialized within the confines of a much bigger and surprisingly well defined trading range. the chart below tells the tale. after bumping into a ceiling at 00NUMBER00 four times in the middle of last year the bulls finally acquiesced and relinquished control to the bears …… until the 00NUMBER00 turned into support. aapl stock touched that support level three times since august with two of those times being this year to make the cup portion of the cup and handle pattern and ultimately used that floor as a springboard for the current breakout effort. assuming this trading range is still relevant and it likely is a revisit of 00NUMBER00 isnt out of the question even if apple stock doesnt get there in a perfectly straight line. while much of the medias and investors focus on apple of late has been on the chart it should be noted that theres also plenty of fundamental support for higher prices. as of the latest look aapl stock is valued at a trailing price to earnings of 00NUMBER00 and a forward looking one of 00NUMBER00. thats downright cheap for a company of this caliber. apple on its worst day is still more investment worthy than most other companies on their best day. the current bullish tide simply says the market is starting to remember that again. dont fight the tape. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post why apple inc. could shoot 00NUMBER00 higher aapl  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apples most successful iphone yet the iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple via 00NUMBER00. late last year apple  introduced the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which serve as direct replacements for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus as the idevice makers flagship products. naturally the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus saw price reductions of 00NUMBER00 for each model making larger screen iphones more affordable. one question that i think is worth pondering is the following once apple introduces the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus should it keep selling the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus here are my thoughts. it depends on the region    in developed markets where people generally have the cash or the carrier subsidies to buy new iphones keeping the older iphone 00NUMBER00 plus around at reduced prices doesnt make a whole lot of sense. fairly high end phones are quite accessible in developed markets thanks to carrier subsidies andor common monthly installment plans. additionally in regions where apple is seen as a status symbol and folks are willing to pony up significantly in order to get their hands on the latest though pricey apple products it would again make little sense to potentially risk cannibalizing sales of newerhigher end iphones by lower end ones. however in regions where apple has very little market segment share due to its products being too expensive for many potential buyers who instead are forced to purchase lower cost android devices keeping the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus around and reducing prices on them makes perfect sense. in those regions there is so little high end iphone business to potentially cannibalize that price reduced 00NUMBER00 plus models would likely be a net positive for apple in terms of revenue and total profit. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will probably be quite cheap to produce    the nice thing about apple water falling older generation iphones to lower price points is that by the time apple needs to use those devices to try to gain share in emerging markets the cost structures on said devices should be quite good. take the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus for example. the machines and tooling that apple had installed at its manufacturing partners are probably fully depreciated at this point which should help lower manufacturing costs. additionally the components inside of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus should also be very cheap for apples suppliers to produce and apple to ultimately acquire. this should give apple quite a bit of room to take down pricing on these devices again in select markets while still maintaining reasonable gross profit margins per device. how low could apple go    i dont think apple needs to go crazy with price reductions on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. taking them down from the 00NUMBER00 starting price points to say 00NUMBER00 for the entry level 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models could be enough to drive non trivial incremental demand. these price points are still well in the range of premium smartphone but for many potential customers in emerging markets that 00NUMBER00 difference could have a real impact. this could be an interesting part of the apple story in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apples main priority should be to build a compelling enough product with iphone 00NUMBER00 to get its flagship products back on a growth path i believe that lower cost iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models to go along with price reduced iphone 00NUMBER00 models   could help apple grow in markets where it simply doesnt have much of a presence. well see what apple does come september. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode

00NUMBER00 inch iphone and the apple watch 00NUMBER00 at an event on march 00NUMBER00. although the popularity of tablets is dipping on the whole apple could be about to regain the title of best tablet with the ipad air 00NUMBER00. here is a roundup of the rumors on the ipad 00NUMBER00 that have been flying around so fardesignit looks likely that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will feature the same design as the larger ipad pro with four speakers and a smart connector. this is based on leaked cases and sketches which also show an led flash cutout next to the rear camera. the leaked cases suggest that the ipad air 00NUMBER00 will be 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 wider than the ipad air 00NUMBER00. it sounds as though apple will use the 00NUMBER00 series aluminum alloy used on the latest iphone and apple watch on the new tablet although no other ipads are. featuresrumors suggest that the new tablet will provide support for the apple pencil but probably wont have 00NUMBER00 touch. however it will support biometric security and apple pay thanks to the touchid scanner in the home button. ming chi kuo an analyst at kgi securities who has a stellar reputation when it comes to predicting apple features said 00NUMBER00 touch is unlikely due to production issues. the fact that the feature was missing from the top of the range ipad pro is another clue that it probably wont be included here. specsif as predicted the ipad air 00NUMBER00 includes the 00NUMBER00 chipset 00NUMBER00 of ram it would be the fastest 00NUMBER00 inch tablet in the world. with those specs the new tablet would match the ipad pro in offering laptop like power in tablet form. displayaccording to some rumors the ipad air 00NUMBER00 could feature 00NUMBER00 resolution ips lcd screen which would be a crazy upgrade. it seems unlikely given that it didnt include 00NUMBER00 on apple tv nor the ipad pro which has a 00NUMBER00 x 00NUMBER00 resolution. if it were to include 00NUMBER00 on the ipad air 00NUMBER00 the screen would place enormous demands on performance and battery life. camerathe latest leaks show that the new tablet will have an led flash below the rear camera which will allow for better shots at night. it seems likely that the camera itself will be the 00NUMBER00 isight camera found on the ipad pro. ipad air 00NUMBER00 release date and priceapple could choose to announce the ipad air 00NUMBER00 alongside 00NUMBER00 inch iphone and an upgraded apple watch. an event is scheduled to take place on march 00NUMBER00 in cupertino. looking at the history of apple tablet releases gives us a better idea of the probability. ever since the 00NUMBER00 generation ipad and ipad mini released in october 00NUMBER00 apple has been announcing new tablets in october. however before that the company announced its tablets in 00NUMBER00 the original ipad ipad 00NUMBER00 and ipad 00NUMBER00. when it comes to pricing it looks as though the ipad air 00NUMBER00 cost the same as the ipad air 00NUMBER00 at launch date. therefore the breakdown will 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00. as it stands apple fans will be able to choose from silver gold and space gray. could apple be about to add

spike its stock saw just two days ago. cpxx rose at one point almost 00NUMBER00 in after hours trading  monday after the company announced positive results from a phase 00NUMBER00 of its drug vyxeos. vyxeos treats a high risk sometimes fatal form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia aml. the average overall survival for patients treated with vyxeos in the study was 00NUMBER00 months compared to 00NUMBER00 months for patients receiving 00NUMBER00 a common care regiment of cytarabine and daunorubicin. this represents a 00NUMBER00 improvement in favor of vyxeos. the overall survival advantage seen with cpx 00NUMBER00 compared 00NUMBER00 along with a superior response rate and no increase in serious toxicity indicates that well likely have a new standard of care for treating older patients with secondary aml said jeffrey e. lancet m. d. senior member and chief of the leukemiamyelodysplasia program at moffitt cancer center and the principal investigator for the study. this represents a major step forward for a very difficult to treat patient population. based on these results the company expects to submit a new drug application for vyxeos with the fda later this year and submit a marketing authorization application with the  european medicines agency   in the first quarter of 00NUMBER00 celator said in a statement. time to investcelator a tiny relatively unknown biotech stock at least up until monday could be an opportunity for investors to invest in a company right from the get go. over the past five days cpxx has soared 00NUMBER00 and in the past month is

daily volume of roughly 00NUMBER00 but spiked to an impressive 00NUMBER00 million shares on tuesday which as one analyst noted even surpassed  tech giant apple inc aapl. investment firm roth capital partners increased its price target for celator to 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 and in a research note tuesday   said that we believe having a new aml drug showing a survival benefit represents a low hurdle in delivering such a partnership. h. c. wainwright has upped its price target  for the company as well from just 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share. currently cpxx is trading above 00NUMBER00 per share up significantly from its 00NUMBER00 week low of only 00NUMBER00 last month and 00NUMBER00 just this past monday. celator could be the next big star of the biotech industry. its entire drug portfolio  is impressive and strives to treat many different forms of cancer. if the company receives fda approval for vyxeos it would not be surprising if its stock hits that newly upped 00NUMBER00

eve 00NUMBER00 and its all time high last april apple inc. aapl    took a breather. it plunged to a multiyear low of 00NUMBER00 in the august flash crash and continued to trade at relatively depressed levels through the end of the year. investors were spooked but i called out the weakness as a buying opportunity. apple stock  has yet to make a run back up to new highs but my outlook here remains the same. let me tell you why. first lets start with a technical analysis. apples bottoming process began in late january when the stock fell to test its multiyear low of 00NUMBER00. the support held but aapl again came close to that level several times over the next month until buyers who couldnt resist the bargain prices finally began to push the stock higher in late february. taking a look at the chart you can see that the 00NUMBER00 day moving average the yellow line hasnt been the best indicator for apple stock as it has traded both above and below the ma several times over the past year. that said aapl did blast through the indicator on march 00NUMBER00 one of the heaviest volume days the shares had seen in the last month. thats a positive sign but even more important was the rally that followed through 00NUMBER00 which was the high from late january. after climbing as high as 00NUMBER00 apple stock pulled back to successfully test the old resistance level at 00NUMBER00 it into support and restart its leg higher. but lets shift our focus to the 00NUMBER00 day ma the blue line which has been a more accurate identifier of support and resistance levels. the 00NUMBER00 day currently sitting around 00NUMBER00 is the next target level for aapl especially now that its trading at the best levels since the first week of january. however given that the indicator is moving lower and there is price resistance 00NUMBER00 the stock will likely face headwinds as it nears 00NUMBER00. but with the way the chart looks right now the undervalued fundamentals suggest that apple stock could overcome them to retest its november high of 00NUMBER00. outside of the chart action theres no denying that aapl moves on headlines. the biggest news item recently has to do with the fbi and privacy laws   but i dont see the companys battle with the u. s. government having either a positive or negative affect on the stocks future outlook. the last meaningful launch by the company was the iphone 00NUMBER00 back in september 00NUMBER00. sure apple has released other products and product updates since then the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus for instance and a rumored upcoming  iphone 00NUMBER00 but the company has not offered any product specific news that has acted as a major catalyst to push the shares higher. and for the stock to make a major move it needs major news. still i have no doubts in aapls ability to launch a new and innovative product in the near future. my only concern here is that in the current rally volume hasnt been consistently above average. therefore im looking for that volume to pick up especially when the stock attempts to break through its resistance and 00NUMBER00 day moving average. all of this added up tells me one thing apple stock is most certainly a buying opportunity at current levels. and once it smashes through its ceiling i suspect well see new highs in the future. matthew mccall is founder and president

image credit apple. it has been interesting to see the meteoric rise of china based huawei in the smartphone business. the company has gone from a relative no name in phones to being one of the largest vendors in the marketplace growing smartphone sales at an extremely rapid clip. this success is no doubt fueled by the companys ability to rapidly launch best in class android smartphones at a wide variety of price points. apple   on the other hand is expected to see iphone shipments decline year over year in the current fiscal year. although apple is generally known to have something of a lock on the premium portion of the smartphone market huawei seems to be doing a solid job of building products that can in many cases rival apples. based on the leaked specifications of the upcoming huawei 00NUMBER00 of smartphones huawei isnt just offering a solid alternative to apple but seems to be blowing the current iphone 00NUMBER00 plus out of the water in a number of key areas. dual cameras huawei beats apple to the punch    the marquee feature for the upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 pro is expected to be the use of a dual lens camera. however this feature isnt expected to appear on the smaller iphone 00NUMBER00 nor even on some of the larger iphones i. e. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. those phones arent expected to launch until september. in contrast all three of huaweis upcoming 00NUMBER00 series of smartphones from the five inch model all the way through 00NUMBER00 inch model are expected  to come with dual 00NUMBER00 megapixel cameras complete with optical image stabilization and laser focus. when the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones come out it would seem that at least as far as a number of key technologies go it will deliver at best yesterdays technology today. better displays beefier batteries slimmer bodies    both the 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 lite are expected to pack 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 resolution displays. in contrast the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 comes with a relatively low resolution 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 max is said to come with a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 display. the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 comes with just 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 panel. even more interestingly huawei has apparently managed to pack large 00NUMBER00 mah batteries into both the 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 max and even the low end 00NUMBER00 lite gets a 00NUMBER00 mah battery. the iphone 00NUMBER00 on the other hand is saddled with just a 00NUMBER00 mah battery. to add insult to injury the 00NUMBER00 series of phones are expected to be thinner  than apples iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the apple phones 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick respectively. huaweis are said to be just 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick. apple needs to stop phoning it in start delivering leadership hardware again    although there are some areas in which apples iphone 00NUMBER00 series of phones deliver leadership hardware 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 touch subsystem the idevice makers flagships are being lapped in ways that are actually material to the user experience. apple knows that its brand is powerful and that ios is unmatched but as were seeing with apples struggles during this product cycle phoning it in on key pieces of technology is just not a viable strategy in an increasingly competitive market. my worry for apple is that it may have gotten too arrogant about its positioning in the marketplace and that it will soon be blindsided by hungrier more aggressive competitors like huawei. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of phones the company is going to need to start delivering leadership hardware again. that hardware will need to stay  leadership throughout the life cycles of the phones or its going to need to start introducing flagship iphones at a more rapid clip. not having a truly leadership set of phones in the market place is unacceptable.

expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  ipad pro. image source apple. dont do it apple. ahead of next weeks 00NUMBER00 reporting that the rumored 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro will start 00NUMBER00 a whole 00NUMBER00 higher than the historical 00NUMBER00 starting price of the 00NUMBER00 inch flagship tablet. that would buy a wifi only model with 00NUMBER00 of storage with expected upsells for lte cellular connectivity or more storage. apple will reportedly keep the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad air 00NUMBER00 at the 00NUMBER00 price point while the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro would cost a 00NUMBER00 premium. ipad air looks like it might be discontinued as well. heres why it might be the wrong move. finally moving on up    when steve jobs unveiled the original ipad in 00NUMBER00 one of the biggest shockers was the incredibly aggressive 00NUMBER00 starting price. at the time most analysts investors and consumers were expecting the tablet to cost anywhere from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 a minimum so the 00NUMBER00 price tag was a pleasant surprise. it took a few years for rivals to even catch up after which they expectedly undercut with cheaper models. but for a while there the ipad really was the most affordable tablet on the market. how often does that happenapple has been able to stand pat at 00NUMBER00 every year since for the entry level configuration of the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad. even if apple keeps the ipad air 00NUMBER00 at that same 00NUMBER00 price the value is harder to justify since that device was originally released in 00NUMBER00. its still a great tablet but its starting to age a little bit. apple should be more aggressive    while apple rarely gives in to external pressure from investors or consumers there seems to be some hubris in this rumored pricing strategy. we all know that ipad unit sales have stagnated in recent years i wont bore you with rehashing the details and moving pricing up incrementally will only hurt demand. for example heres how ipad starting prices might look like before and after the rumored change not including the minisprice 00NUMBER00 pro 00NUMBER00 inchipad pro 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 ipad pro 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 air 00NUMBER00 air 00NUMBER00 air keeping ipad air 00NUMBER00 in the lineup makes sense since its still a strong offering but apple should be at least willing to discount the device due to its age. and a 00NUMBER00 difference between a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro also makes sense since pro models will support apple pencil and smart keyboard while sporting better cameras and audio systems. but cascading ipad air 00NUMBER00 down to the 00NUMBER00 price point and pricing the new 00NUMBER00 inch pro at 00NUMBER00 would be more aggressive. its also hard to imagine that the cost curve for the 00NUMBER00 inch pro is so high that apple desperately needs the extra 00NUMBER00 to maintain its margin profile. besides even if there was a relative hit on margins it would likely be negligible in the grand scheme of apples consolidated results since it probably wouldnt be a huge part of the overall unit mix. be aggressive apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click

with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage with the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models coming in at 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 reported the successor to the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad air 00NUMBER00 apparently be an ipad pro with a 00NUMBER00 inch display 00NUMBER00 upgraded 00NUMBER00 megapixel camera and a higher quality display. the 00NUMBER00 reported   will come in 00NUMBER00 gigabyte and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte storage configurations starting at 00NUMBER00 no price is given for the higher tier configuration though it is likely to be 00NUMBER00 given the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro pricing. this strategy is hardly a surprise given current ipadtablet market business dynamics. strategy increase prices pack in more features    apple generally needs to achieve a certain gross profit margin level on its devices. this means that for a given selling price it cant go beyond a certain bill of materials cost. to provide added content beyond that cost apple needs to do one of two thingsincrease device selling prices orlearn to live with lower per unit marginsin an environment of very high industrywide growth the second option can work if those added features help the company grow revenue so much that overall gross profits move up. in a market where units are flat to declining and ipad sales sure are declining the goal should be to maximize profitability per unit while not further damaging unit sales. the problem with ipad is twofold. firstly the tablet segment is being cannibalized by larger screen iphones many customers who purchase say large screen iphones may be less likely to need an ipad or upgrade an aging one. secondly even though there are many folks who still want ipads the ones that they purchased previously continue to be good enough the upgrade cycles here are fairly lengthy. the silver lining though is that because these devices tend to last a long time customers are probably more willing to pay more upfront for a higher quality device. from apples perspective it makes sense to take advantage of this by adding interesting features quad speakers faster 00NUMBER00 chip more ram fancier display and just charging more. not going to save ipad but every little bit helps    the fundamental issues that plague ipad and the broader tablet market are still there long upgrade cycles robust competition from larger screen smartphones. i dont think investors should reasonably expect the ipad market to be a major growth driver for apple from here on out. i expect that at some point ipad sales will bottom out though im not certain at what annual unit run rate that bottom will come at. from there i wouldnt bank on much growth but rather just flattish unit sales for quite a while following the bottom. perhaps if apple is able to bring significant new and unique technologies to the ipad beyond a larger screen a faster chip and stylus support relative to the iphone ipad could someday return to growth. at this point though this is hard to imagine. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry

stock advice trading tipsall eyes are on the  apple inc. aapl    let us loop you in event today  even if its probably not going to be a major mover of apple stock. well not if the rumors  are true. aapl is expected to unveil some cool stuff today but it wont be firing off the kind of products that could shake  apple stock  out of its extended slump. investors cooled off on shares when it became clear that the latest iterations the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus  werent as popular as last years iphones. sales of the critical gadget were flat  in the most recent quarter and are expected to decline in the current quarter. that would be the first ever year over year drop in iphone sales. since the iphone segment is by far away the companys most important business this slowdown has been giving the market fits. indeed apple stock is off about 00NUMBER00 from its most recent high which was nine long months ago. happily all it will take to get aapl moving again is a new hit iphone. not so happily apple isnt going to drop that at mondays conference … if apple watchers are right anyway. on the iphone front multiple media reports say apple will debut a significantly smaller iphone today. its thought to be called the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the new handset will feature 00NUMBER00 inch touchscreen. by comparison the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have screens of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 inches respectively. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 resonates with consumers it could give aapls smartphone business a nice jolt but its not the handset that carries the weight of turning around the companys fortunes. that will presumably be the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch later this year. aapl also is expected to drop a smaller version of its ipad pro tablet. with a 00NUMBER00 inch touchscreen it will be the same size as ipad air. of course apples ipad segment like the entire tablet market   isnt really a source of growth. software updates to ios and perhaps os x could also be on the agenda along with some other more incremental releases. no this isnt the event that will reverse the slide in apple stock but its not intended to be. analysts applaud apples strategy of attracting share outside of the high end smartphone market. as analysts at r. w. baird said in a note to clientsthe iphone 00NUMBER00 should help open up new pockets of demand apples global iphone share was just 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 due in part to its high end focus. when its said and done mondays media event could give apple stock a short term lift but the real resurrection will have to wait until fall. as of this writing dan burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post apple inc. aapl the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be a stopgap not a savior  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. it might seem odd to put the words apple    and value stock in the same sentence especially with the meteoric growth it has experienced over the past decade. yet as growth has slowed and the stock has underperformed the market and its peers it makes sense to see how it stacks up as a value investment. what better way to determine this than to go back to the father of value investing himselfthe quick and dirty method    benjamin graham loved to buy securities that were underpriced compared to their estimated intrinsic value. graham had a relatively simple equation to do a quick sniff test to see if a stock had potential as a value investment. often referred to as the ben graham formula it is as followsthe intrinsic value of a stock trailing 00NUMBER00 month eps 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 eps growth rate 00NUMBER00 bond yieldits a bit confusing at first so lets break it down. 00NUMBER00 figure is a number graham used as a multiple of earnings he was willing to pay for a company with zero growth which he then adjusts by the expected long term growth rate. the 00NUMBER00 is the minimum rate of return graham required as it was the average yield of high grade corporate bonds in the 00NUMBER00 when he introduced the formula. dividing by the current aaa bond yield adjusts this to the present. for apple the trailing 00NUMBER00 month eps is 00NUMBER00 analysts are expecting  the next five year eps growth rate will be close to 00NUMBER00. triple a bonds are currently 00NUMBER00 but using a long term average especially in todays low interest rate environment is safer. the average aaa corporate bond yield going back to 00NUMBER00 is approximately 00NUMBER00. doing the math gives us a whopping stock value of 00NUMBER00 per share is apple really that undervalued or are we missing something first the formula is very sensitive to the expected growth rate. ideally you want to use as long of a growth rate as possible such as 00NUMBER00 year forecasts but wall street analysts typically only go out five years. if we assume long term growth is closer to 00NUMBER00 which is closer to what the smartphone market will be slowing down to then the value declines to 00NUMBER00 per share but thats still a large undervaluation. second the 00NUMBER00 number and multiplying the growth rate by 00NUMBER00 somewhat arbitrary. some value investors  prefer to adjust these numbers to something more conservative such as 00NUMBER00 times for a stock with zero growth and only multiply the growth factor by 00NUMBER00 instead of 00NUMBER00. doing this would result in a value of 00NUMBER00 per share. so even after being more conservative apple still looks cheap according to grahams formula. the graham checklist    perhaps a better sense of whether apple passes the value test is to stack it up against grahams 00NUMBER00 point checklist. if you are unfamiliar with the 00NUMBER00 point checklist and some of the caveats you can review it in an earlier foolish article. the first five points of the checklist look to see if the stock is a good value and underpriced while the second half of the checklist makes sure you are not buying a company that is circling the drain or overleveraged  and at risk of bankruptcy. an earnings to price yield at least twice the aaa bond rate. an earnings to price yield is exactly what it sounds like  the inverse of the pe ratio. apple passes this one as its current pe of 00NUMBER00 is equivalent to an ep of 00NUMBER00 more than double the current aaa bond yield of 00NUMBER00. pe ratio of less than 00NUMBER00 of the highest pe ratio the stock has had over the past five years. apple had a pe ratio of near 00NUMBER00 times five years ago so its current ratio of 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 of that high not quite reaching the 00NUMBER00 threshold. dividend yield of at least two thirds the aaa bond yield. apple falls a bit short on this one as well with a dividend yield of 00NUMBER00 which is 00NUMBER00 of the current aaa bond yield 00NUMBER00. stock price below two thirds of tangible book value per share. a big miss here as apples regular book value is a quarter of its share price. granted this metric doesnt work well for tech stocks or companies with massive brand capital. items 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 on the list deal with net current asset value current assets less total liabilities. this one also doesnt work well for todays tech stocks and it really doesnt work for apple as most of its massive cash hoard is classified as a long term asset. because of this we get a negative value when trying to calculate this metric. note that very few companies pass this criterion these days. total debt less than book value. even though apple has utilized the debt markets a number of times its total debt of 00NUMBER00 billion is well below its book value of 00NUMBER00 billion. current ratio greater than 00NUMBER00. if you look this up you will find apples is 00NUMBER00 for the most recent quarter but this also falls victim to the fact its massive cash hoard is classified as long term investments. if we include this cash the current ratio is a very 00NUMBER00. see item number 00NUMBER00. earnings growth of at least 00NUMBER00 in the past 00NUMBER00. you might have to have been living under a rock to not notice the massive earnings growth apple put up over the last decade. no more than two years of declining earnings of 00NUMBER00 or more over the past decade. check however apple did have one year a 00NUMBER00 decline 00NUMBER00. how did apple do for the first half of the checklist apple only hit one valuation metric but wasnt too far away from no. 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. this falls in line with a stock that seems attractive but may not be at a rock bottom price. however this is countered by the companys financial health and earnings stability. most companies that look like a steal are priced that way for a reason so graham wanted to make sure people didnt fall into a value trap. criteria 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 either be discounted or updated for todays world and tech stocks. overall i think apple would certainly show up on grahams radar today. it might not be a dirt cheap bargain but remember that even graham distinguished between defensive investors and enterprising investors. based on some of his metrics it appears apple could be a great play for an enterprising investor. but as always these are only guidelines to help and more homework should always be done. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited

the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. apple  just hosted its march 00NUMBER00 event and the mac maker had a handful of notable and mostly expected announcements to make. ceo tim cook started off the festivities by outlining two initiatives that apple continues to work on. the company is making strong progress with environmental initiatives and has even been devoting rd resources to a new project called liam a robot that specializes in deconstructing iphones in order to recover a greater amount of materials and resources compared to current recycling methods. apple also continues to help advance medical research with its researchkit and announced a new carekit framework as well. watch and os updates    apple watch is getting a few new band colors and configurations along with a new band style made out of woven nylon priced at 00NUMBER00. most notably on the apple watch front the company is reducing the starting price from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 the entry level sport models. pricing on the higher end steel and gold models is unchanged. both tvos and ios are also receiving free updates today. tvos will get features like folders live photos dictation and siri for the app store. ios 00NUMBER00 brings things like night shift which adjusts the display at night to make it easier to sleep and a few other app specific improvements. iphone se    the feature presentation was iphone se which is an update to the 00NUMBER00 inch model. the overall design is nearly identical to the outgoing iphone 00NUMBER00 contrary to prior rumors that apple would use curved sides like in the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. the only notable aesthetic changes are matte chamfered edges and the addition of rose gold. the real changes are on the inside. image source apple. iphone se will get a faster 00NUMBER00 processor alongside an integrated 00NUMBER00 motion co processor a two generation upgrade compared to the 00NUMBER00 in the 00NUMBER00. faster lte and wi fi connectivity are also onboard along with more lte bands and apple has added an nfc chip to support apple pay. updating the 00NUMBER00 inch model in the lineup is important because not everyone wants  a larger iphone. the smaller iphone also serves another critical strategic purpose since its an entry level device. many customers choose the 00NUMBER00 inch model for their first smartphone particularly in china. apple says that over half of its 00NUMBER00 inch iphone customers in china were new to the platform. apple is also getting aggressive with wooing first time smartphone buyers and iphone se will start at 00NUMBER00 for a 00NUMBER00 gb model. adding 00NUMBER00 gets you to 00NUMBER00 gb. the device is free on contract for customers still using the subsidy model. interestingly this also implies a subsidy reduction since apple used to get an estimated 00NUMBER00 per subsidized device but the impact should be negligible since most people now use installment or leasing programs. the company sold over 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 inch iphones in 00NUMBER00 how important this product segment still is. thats still only about 00NUMBER00 of the total product mix 00NUMBER00 million total iphone unit sales last year but the company is essentially launching an iphone 00NUMBER00 in an iphone 00NUMBER00 body which may spur more demand within the 00NUMBER00 inch product segment. ipad pro    the 00NUMBER00 inch display on the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is still the most popular display size which is why apple is launching 00NUMBER00 inch version of the ipad pro. the smaller variant has nearly all of the same specs as the larger one including 00NUMBER00 processor and an updated display that supports apple pencil. the 00NUMBER00 speaker audio system is also included as is a smart connector for a smaller smart keyboard. image source apple. one area where the specs differ is that the 00NUMBER00 inch pro will actually have better  cameras than the 00NUMBER00 inch pro. on one hand it makes sense that the rear camera is less important for the 00NUMBER00 inch pro since no one in their right mind should be holding up 00NUMBER00 inch tablet to take photos but on the other hand the front camera is used for video conferencing so youd think 00NUMBER00 inch pro should get some attention there. the 00NUMBER00 inch pro starts at 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 gb and while apple is discontinuing the original ipad air it is keeping the ipad air 00NUMBER00 around but dropping it to the 00NUMBER00 price point. it would have been a mistake  to keep the air 00NUMBER00 at 00NUMBER00 since the device is aging but now customers looking for a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad have two choices and the products are positioned sufficiently apart with a 00NUMBER00. both the new iphone and ipad will be available to order on march 00NUMBER00 and will ship on march 00NUMBER00. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres

the iphone se its new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone. the device has been rumored for months and much of the online speculation turned out to be true including the name. and as expected the iphone se pushed the iphone 00NUMBER00 out of apples lineup as the new smaller and more affordable iphone option. now that we know exactly what aapl is offering consumers  who arent enamoured with the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00 plus here are the 00NUMBER00 things you need to know about the iphone se. 00NUMBER00. the iphone se is the most powerful 00NUMBER00 inch smartphone ever. apple is using the same 00NUMBER00 bit 00NUMBER00 processor powering the iphone 00NUMBER00 the iphone se double the cpu performance and three times the graphics power of the iphone 00NUMBER00. it also has 00NUMBER00 of ram the same as the iphone 00NUMBER00 and double what the iphone 00NUMBER00 has. 00NUMBER00. the iphone se looks like an updated iphone 00NUMBER00. while there was speculation it would get the iphone 00NUMBER00 rounded treatment the iphone se retains the beloved design of the 00NUMBER00 series with aluminum glass and chamfered edges. it retains 00NUMBER00 inch retina display at 00NUMBER00 ppi and at 00NUMBER00 oz its the lightest iphone in apples lineup. 00NUMBER00. its not just the cpu thats faster connectivity is way faster too. the iphone se gets 00NUMBER00 wi fi bluetooth 00NUMBER00 and improved lte support compared to the iphone 00NUMBER00. that means faster wireless and support for wi fi calling. 00NUMBER00. apple included a good camera. the iphone se isnt hobbled when it comes to photography offering the same 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 aperture isight camera offered in the 00NUMBER00. it includes support for live photos slo mo and 00NUMBER00 video. however the front selfie camera is a 00NUMBER00 mp version which is much lower resolution than the 00NUMBER00 shooter in the iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone se is apples most affordable new phone. starting at 00NUMBER00 unlocked   this is the lowest priced new iphone apple has ever released. aapl says it will start at 00NUMBER00 when financed through a carrier. 00NUMBER00. but most people will be better off opting for the 00NUMBER00. that lowball 00NUMBER00 iphone se has just 00NUMBER00 of storage and with live photos and 00NUMBER00 video it will fill up fast. an extra hundred bucks upgrades the phone to a much more 00NUMBER00 of storage. 00NUMBER00 the iphone se doesnt offer 00NUMBER00 touch support. apple had to hold back at least one key feature besides size and better selfies to get you to pay for a more expensive iphone. if you want 00NUMBER00 touch youll have to pay the extra for an 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00. the iphone ses touch id sensor and nfc chip supports apple pay. finally small iphone users can experience the joy of paying for coffee with their smartphone. 00NUMBER00. battery life is rated for up to 00NUMBER00 hours talk time or 00NUMBER00 of video playback. that places the iphone se between the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus when it comes to battery life and its significantly better than the iphone 00NUMBER00 could manage. going small doesnt mean having to carry a recharger with you. 00NUMBER00. you can pre order the iphone se starting 00NUMBER00. and it comes in rose gold. as of this writing brad moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post apple inc. 00NUMBER00 things you want to know about the iphone se  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  its that time of year when americas most secure cellphone maker apple inc. aapl  is currently having its large scale apple event that details all the upcoming gadgets the tech juggernaut will be releasing. there has been serious buzz about the forthcoming iphone 00NUMBER00. an article  on bgrcom  suggests that the iphone 00NUMBER00 may not have a headphone jack as well as have an all glass face equipped with an under the screen touch id sensor and 00NUMBER00 touch powered virtual home button feature. the hypothetical design will be slimmer and smaller than previous iphone models and will also have a redesigned antenna on the back. the best part of this iphone 00NUMBER00 concept is the lack of the physical home button the article reads. coupled with the absence of the headphone jack an on screen home button with fingerprint sensing capabilities would let apple reduce the bezel size on the iphone 00NUMBER00 without messing with the screen size. image via bgrcomdespite the article presenting a rather interesting hypothetical design of apples impending new phone both investors and consumers overall have

and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  in line with the rumors ahead of apple  s event on monday the tech giant announced a new lower cost iphone called iphone se. replacing the iphone 00NUMBER00 the phone beefs up the companys offering at lower prices giving apple a more appealing product for customers looking to spend less for their new iphone. it might be both smaller and lower cost than its flagship iphone lineup but that doesnt mean the device isnt important. further the companys move to give a lower cost iphone may also provide a glimpse into a maturing smartphone market. image source apple. before we dive in to some of the implications for apples business heres a quick overview of key details about the new phone. price  with a starting price of 00NUMBER00 the phone is 00NUMBER00 less than the starting price of its flagship iphone 00NUMBER00. and it replaces apples two year old iphone 00NUMBER00. design  apples new iphone se has basically the same 00NUMBER00 inch form factor as the iphone 00NUMBER00 it replaced. to create it we started with a beloved design then reinvented it from the inside out apple says about the phone on its website. battery  one strong point about the new device is its battery life. apple asserts the phone has up to 00NUMBER00 hours  of battery life while using lte internet. this is 00NUMBER00 more than the battery life for the iphone 00NUMBER00. camera  the phones camera is also significantly better than the iphone 00NUMBER00. indeed the iphone se rear facing isight camera is the same 00NUMBER00 megapixel camera used in the iphone 00NUMBER00. cpu and gpu  the phones 00NUMBER00 chip and 00NUMBER00 motion co processer doubles the cpu performance of the iphone 00NUMBER00 it replaced. its gpu performance is three times faster than the iphone 00NUMBER00. chart source apple. availability  orders for the new device begin this thursday and shipments begin on march 00NUMBER00. by the end of may apple said the phone will already be available in over 00NUMBER00 countries. why it matters   the upgrade makes sense. during apples most recent earnings call ceo tim cook specifically noted that the iphone 00NUMBER00 to sell well for the company even though it has introduced two generations of new flagship phones since the devices release. further a growing portion of apples sales are coming from emerging markets like china and india where its more difficult to afford an iphone. launched about halfway between the companys usual september timeframe for annual iphone announcements the timing highlights the apples eagerness to do whatever it can to help boost iphone sales. during apples most recent quarter iphone sales growth slowed down significantly to 00NUMBER00 year over year growth in iphone revenue and nearly zero growth in iphone unit sales. and for apples current quarter the company actually guided for about an 00NUMBER00 year over year decline in total revenue because of its expectations for iphone sales during the quarter to be lower than in the year ago period. while the launch of apples iphone se could help moderate  or even prevent year over year declines in iphone sales in the second half of the year the phone does prompt some concern about increasing competition. the tech giants need to give its two year old iphone such a significant upgrade without increasing its price could be a sign that its getting more difficult for apple to attract new customers in a maturing smartphone market. to be fair apples ability to so significantly upgrade its two year old iphone could also simply be a sign of the tech giants enormous scale and increasing prowess in mobile processing power. whatever the reason apple chose to introduce the iphone se mid cycle investors shouldnt fret increasing competition is already priced into apples wildly cheap valuation. the stock trades at just 00NUMBER00 times earnings. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just

any other name. . . image source apple. the rumors about apple  s updated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone were true. sadly   that included the iphone se name. at least the company dropped the 00NUMBER00 since initial rumors were that 00NUMBER00 was in the pipeline. heres the thing apple didnt even officially specify what se stands for. thats a problem. it used to mean something    back in 00NUMBER00 the s in iphone 00NUMBER00 stood for speed since that years model was an incremental improvement to the 00NUMBER00 and apple primarily focused on improving the devices performance. the beefier arm  cortex 00NUMBER00 offered double the cpu performance and the device did just about everything a lot faster. thats mostly been the case in the years since. apple has fallen into a predictable tick tock cycle giving the iphone a new industrial design one year and improving internals and performance every other s year. but at least we knew what s meant. but now it doesnt    fundamentally the whole point of product marketing and branding is in order to convey a message to the consumer. a message about what the company brand or product stands for or its value proposition. if there is no message then what is apple conveyinggreg joswiak vp of product marketing did not elaborate on the name. image source apple. presumably apples management put plenty of thought and discussion into what se stood for but its unclear why they wouldnt share that with the rest of us. i have a few ideas on what it could mean while the internet always charmingly helpful   has also offered a few suggestionsspecial edition most likelyspeed enhancedsmall extrasuper extravagantsecure encryption probably bad timing on this onenot super expensivestill expensivesystem expansion like the macintosh se released 00NUMBER00 exactgratuitous product naming with no purpose or message is worse than a bad product name. think about all of the other consumer electronics companies that have esoteric alphanumeric model numbers and actually list them as such. apple has long been the exception to the rule enjoying simplified brands and product families. think about the aforementioned macintosh se which was launched during steve jobs absence. that might say something since jobs led marketing and pushed for simplicity. time to simplify    some industry watchers are seemingly confused by apples decision to use the same ipad pro branding for the new 00NUMBER00 inch tablet. but this actually makes a lot  of sense since this is precisely how apple denotes different mac models like the macbook pro family by display size and model year. it would be great if apple is overall moving away from its number naming scheme due to the inherent unsustainability and sheer silliness over time. ipads are now clearly delineated as mini air and pro. why hasnt the company adopted a similar mechanism in its most important producta secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

journey so far as the tech giant nears its 00NUMBER00 birthday on april 00NUMBER00. it was followed by tim cook proudly announcing an incredible milestone which apple inc. aapl recently achieved more than 00NUMBER00 billion active apple devices in use around the world. here’s are the highlights from the event. the “big” issuetim cook was quick to touch on the big issue which he said was everyone’s mind. he said “we built the iphone for you our customers and we know that it is a deeply personal device. for many of us the iphone is an extension of ourselves for many of us. ” the ceo emphasized on the company’s belief and responsibility towards its customers which is to help them in protection of their data and privacy. he reiterated apple’s stance on the issue and said “we owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country. this is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility. ” meanwhile the highly anticipated hearing scheduled for tuesday was postponed after the government said “it may have found another way to view the phones contents. ”environmentlisa jackson the head of apple’s environmental team spoke of the company’s environmental concerns and its ambitious goal which was set two years back “to become 00NUMBER00 renewable. ” a lot has been achieved and now 00NUMBER00 of apple’s facilities worldwide run on renewable energy with 00NUMBER00 operations in the u. s. as well as offices and stores in china are on renewable power. overall apple has achieved to become 00NUMBER00 renewable in 00NUMBER00 countries around the globe. she spoke about apple’s initiatives on solar initiatives recycling use of sustainable forests and conservation of forests. the highlight was a very cool rd project called liam. liam a recycling robot can deconstruct an old iphone and detect remove and segregate parts for reuse so that the “materials inside the iphone can live on. ”ipad prothe all new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro which weighs just under one pound was unveiled by apple. “ipad pro is a new generation of ipad that is indispensable and immersive enabling people to be more productive and more creative. it’s incredibly fast extremely

researchkit has been fantastic. virtually overnight many researchkit studies became the largest in history and researchers are gaining insights and making discoveries that weren’t possible before” said jeff williams apple’s chief operating officer. in addition to some advancements announced for researchkit apple introduced carekit which is “a new software framework designed to help developers enable people to actively manage their own medical conditions. ” with iphone apps using carekit its easier for people to keep a track of their health plans as well as monitor symptoms and medication. apple watchtim cook announced that apple watch has now become the 00NUMBER00 selling smartwatch in the world. as predicted apple did not make any announcements on the new version of its wearable product apple watch 00NUMBER00 however new colors of bands as well as brand new material band was introduced. it is called the “woven nylon band” which features a unique four layered construction and comes in a variety of vibrant colors. the “spring lineup” also included the sport and leather band in new colors along with new space black milanese loop. apple watch which will be now available for a lesser starting price of 00NUMBER00 from the earlier 00NUMBER00. according to canalys estimates “apple dominated the smart watch market in 00NUMBER00 accounting for over 00NUMBER00 million units and two thirds of all shipments. ”apple tvapple tv has been upgraded for a better experience with dictation which would allow use of voice even for usernames and passwords siri for app store with more

which would allow to organize apps on the home screen. all this and more is now available as a free update on the apple tv. final wordthe announcements made on monday didn’t not add any immediate spark to apple’s stock since the stock movement in the last one month had already factored in the launch of a few new products. the shares of apple have moved up by around 00NUMBER00 in the last 00NUMBER00 days from 00NUMBER00 as on february 00NUMBER00 despite the ongoing legal battle with the department of justice. given the contribution of iphones to the overall revenue 00NUMBER00 during 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and the fact that there is a huge market for smaller iphones apple sold over 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 inch iphones in 00NUMBER00 the launch of iphone se looks promising. apple has already regained its spot as the top company in terms of market capitalization. overall apple’s ongoing new and upgraded products will help to enhance the company’s revenue going forward. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apples latest ipad pro. image credit apple. on march 00NUMBER00 its let us loop you in spring event at which it unveiled new apple watch bands a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone and an all new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. in my mind the most interesting announcement of the bunch was the new ipad which brought a number of interesting enhancements over both the ipad air 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. i believe that many of the innovative features that apple brought to the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro will find their way to the upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 series of devices. here are three that im expecting. anti reflective 00NUMBER00 ahead of the event the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro features a second generation anti reflective coating. this coating per the company means that reflectance is down by 00NUMBER00 relative to the ipad air 00NUMBER00. according to an email exchange with display expert raymond soneira of displaymate high display reflectance reduces image contrast and color saturation and was impressed with the 00NUMBER00 figure that apple announced in the press release. i would be quite surprised if apple didnt bring this technology to the next generation iphone particularly as this would be a good way to improve the effective contrast ratios soneira calls this contrast rating in his display shootouts of the upcoming devices. wide color gamut    last year apple introduced new imacs with displays that cover the dci 00NUMBER00 color gamut which the idevice maker says improves color saturation by 00NUMBER00 over standard srgb. with imacs and now the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro implementing wide gamut displays it seems almost a no brainer to expect apple to implement this technology into next generation iphones. that being said in response to a question about the impact of this wider color gamut on the color accuracy of these displays soneira said that srgb currently accounts for 00NUMBER00 of all current consumer content. this soneira explained means that apple will need to implement multiple display modes one covering the standard srgb gamut and one covering the new dci 00NUMBER00 gamut. true tone display    another neat feature of the ipad pro is the devices ability to alter the color temperature also known as white balance of the display based on ambient lighting conditions. in the presentation apple marketing chief phil schiller said that this feature marketed as a true tone display has not appeared on a device before. once you use a display with this true tone technology you never want to go back schiller said. given the importance of apples iphone business to its top and bottom lines relative to ipad it only makes sense that the company would bring such a significant feature to its next generation iphones. this is particularly true as many ipad pro owners are also likely to be iphone owners. holding customers over until oled    apple is expected to transition at least some of its iphones to oled displays in either late 00NUMBER00 or in late 00NUMBER00. this means that for the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple will be stuck using a more traditional liquid crystal display. if apple is able to bring these three significant advances to the iphone 00NUMBER00 coupled with say a resolution increase for the 00NUMBER00 inch model then the idevice maker should be able to field phones with best in class displays until it can transition to oleds. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry finally bites the dust. just like newspaper publishers telephone utilities stockbrokers record companies bookstores travel agencies and big box retailers did when the internet swept away their business models. and when cable falters you dont want to miss

ipods macbook pros itunes and the companys founder steve jobs. some people believe mr. jobs to be a visionary who revolutionized the way individuals interact with technology while others do not quite understand the hype. what apple is not always associated with is its multiple subsidiaries the number of companies it purchases and how the corporation is organized. this is due to the company being rather secretive with its finances. as of january 00NUMBER00 apple is publically known 00NUMBER00 companies. the actual total is potentially larger as apple does not reveal the majority of its acquisitions unless they are discovered by journals. the purchased companies for the most part are then integrated into existing projects. due to apples concealment of its business operations the following is a guide to what is known about how apple is organized. anobitinformation about anobit is relatively small. anobit is a fabless semiconductor company based in israel that makes a key

most part the public response to apple  s new iphone se has been somewhat muted. the internet is uncharacteristically awash  with sarcastic remarks and witty retorts about why the iphone se and the event itself were nonstarters. but what these comments are missing is that the iphone se is not primarily targeting u. s. consumers. while apple didnt say  what se stood for at the event marketing chief phil schiller later confirmed that the moniker indeed stands for special edition. i have another suggestion iphone se stands for secretly for emerging markets. ok maybe thats a stretch. in memory of iphone 00NUMBER00 you remember back in 00NUMBER00 when there was all this talk about apple finally making a device that would target emerging markets since thats where smartphone unit growth was shifting what investors got instead was the iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 took the mid range price point of 00NUMBER00 mid range specs of the previous generation model but was positioned as a new product since it featured a new unapologetically plastic shell. image source apple. needless to say the iphone 00NUMBER00 was not  the emerging market hero that apple investors needed at the time amid the brutal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 pullback. yet for all of its hopes and dreams iphone 00NUMBER00 was a flop. it was simply priced too high for what investors were hoping it could accomplish. tim cook defended the price at the time by famously saying theres always a large junk part of the market. were not in the junk business. on paper iphone se is precisely  everything that investors wanted from iphone 00NUMBER00. iphone se is the emerging market hero that investors deserve. if an iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 had a baby    iphone se has many of the same headline specs as the current flagship iphone 00NUMBER00 most notably the 00NUMBER00 processor with embedded 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 megapixel camera. the iphone se even has 00NUMBER00 of memory and touch id as well as an nfc chip for apple pay support. the new 00NUMBER00 inch smartphone does not  have things like 00NUMBER00 touch or a faster second generation touch id sensor but the iphone se is undoubtedly a much better handset than the iphone 00NUMBER00 that its replacing. in some ways iphone se is even more powerful than the pricier iphone 00NUMBER00 positioned directly above it. the processor and camera are definitely better se shoots 00NUMBER00 video has improved image processing and supports retina flash. on top of all of that apple is aggressively positioning it at 00NUMBER00 which is lower than the 00NUMBER00 price point where the 00NUMBER00 perched. se is very much an emerging market play and a strong one at that. but at what cost    apple is able to do this in a few ways. first off since se uses the same overall design of 00NUMBER00 the cost curve is mature and likely quite low. with the broader markets shift to larger displays the smaller displays should now be more affordable as well. apple is also probably shaving off costs in other ways such as the matte chamfered edges. if you recall apple previously used crystalline diamond to cut the chamfers. last i checked crystalline diamonds were expensive. iphone se isnt for you    its also like when apple was still selling the aging iphone 00NUMBER00 significant volumes mostly due to entry level customers in emerging markets like china. greg joswiak vp of product marketing. image source apple. apple specifically noted at the event that the majority 00NUMBER00 inch iphone buyers in china are new to the platform. thats who the iphone se is for. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know

expected apple  unveiled its new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se on monday. as far as the hardware goes there werent any big surprises. the iphone se incorporates a lot of the improvements in processing power  and camera performance from the iphone 00NUMBER00 into the same form factor as the iphone 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 touch is missing though. apple took the wraps off its new iphone se model this week. image source apple. however one somewhat surprising aspect of the iphone se rollout was its price. even though the iphone se essentially represents a two year technological leap over the iphone 00NUMBER00 set the u. s. starting price 00NUMBER00 lower at 00NUMBER00. lets take a look at what this decision means. revitalizing the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone    during the iphone se launch event apple ceo tim cook noted that the company sold 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 inch iphones during 00NUMBER00. thats a relatively small proportion of the more than 00NUMBER00 iphones apple sold during the year but its not insignificant. furthermore apple achieved this result even though it hadnt released a new 00NUMBER00 inch device since the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 hit the market in september 00NUMBER00. this meant it didnt have anything new to sell to fans of the 00NUMBER00 inch form factor. as a result some iphone users delayed upgrading their phones. in fact nearly 00NUMBER00 of all iphone usage still comes from older 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch iphones according to fiksu. one key purpose of the iphone se is to catalyze an upgrade cycle among people who prefer the smaller iphones. the iphone se will offer twice the cpu performance and three times the gpu performance of the iphone 00NUMBER00 an 00NUMBER00 megapixel camera more lte bands and faster download speeds than the iphone 00NUMBER00 and apple pay functionality. that should be enough to sell a lot of phones to iphone 00NUMBER00 series users who have refused to buy the larger iphones. testing price elasticity    apple has also found that people buying their first iphone are more likely to opt for a 00NUMBER00 inch model. this may be driven more by price sensitivity than by preference. since late 00NUMBER00 the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 have been apples cheapest models. for people in emerging markets buying their first smartphone or switching from a low end android model the 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch iphones may be unaffordable. the iphone se will cost much less than the iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. with the iphone se apple will test just how much price has been constraining demand. apple could easily have given the new phone a 00NUMBER00 starting price 00NUMBER00 less than the iphone 00NUMBER00. after all the two models are differentiated by their size and one key feature 00NUMBER00 touch. thats similar to how the iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are differentiated by size and one key feature optical image stabilization and those two models are 00NUMBER00 apart in price. instead the iphone se will be priced at 00NUMBER00 in the u. s. for the 00NUMBER00 gb model a full 00NUMBER00 below the iphone 00NUMBER00 starting price. that makes it 00NUMBER00 cheaper than anything apple has offered before at least in the u. s. moreover every previous low end iphone was a holdover model  typically two years old. by contrast price sensitive customers can now get an affordable iphone thats on par with apples most expensive models in terms of performance. this could allow apple to make more headway with lower income customers across the world particularly in key emerging markets like china and india. given that the smartphone market has matured in most developed countries apple will need to succeed in these emerging markets to grow iphone sales in the years ahead. in that sense the iphone se fills the role that many pundits expected for the iphone 00NUMBER00 a few years ago. its a cheaper but still high quality phone that apple can use to draw in more price sensitive consumers. will there be trade down    the risk for apple in developing a phone that is nearly equal to its top of the line models in performance but much cheaper is that some customers trade down. while the iphone se undoubtedly costs less to produce than the iphone 00NUMBER00 the cost savings are far less than the 00NUMBER00 price difference. fortunately apples core audience isnt very price sensitive and most people who have already upgraded to larger models dont want to go back. of course there are a few iphone 00NUMBER00 users who will choose to switch back to the 00NUMBER00 inch model now. screen size is enough of a differentiator that the iphone se isnt likely to undermine sales of pricier models. thus the iphone se gives apple a relatively low risk opportunity to test whether offering a slightly cheaper iphone would attract more customers to its platform. if it succeeds in reigniting iphone unit sales growth in the next two quarters you can count that as a big win for apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts

appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  the iphone se. image credit apple. apple  nasdaq aapl finally went ahead and launched its widely anticipated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone refresh dubbed the iphone se. the device is pretty much what everyone expected it to be it combines the processing power memory and isight cameras from the iphone 00NUMBER00 the wireless subsystem of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the external casing and display lifted from venerable 00NUMBER00. the bold and risky part of all of this is that apple is offering the variant with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage for just 00NUMBER00 will sell customers one with a full 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage for 00NUMBER00. this has a very interesting implication. apple is basically selling a better phone than the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus for less    on the inside arguably where it counts the iphone se is a substantially better smartphone than either the iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 plus. it has significantly more processing power packs in more memory and contains a higher resolution rear facing camera. where the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus excel over the iphone se are the followingdisplay quality the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus use higher resolution displays with superior viewing angles and contrast ratio. display size the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus offer significantly more screen real estate than does the iphone se. industrial design the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are thinner and arguably more modern looking designs. although many potential customers probably pay more attention to the above externalcosmetic features rather than on the processing power and features on the inside a non trivial portion of the iphone buying population will appreciate the relative value that the iphone se brings to the table specification wise. apple may cannibalize perhaps to a material degree its older generation iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones in the six month period or so that they occupy apples mid tier. an attempt to try to juice iphone sales with a value product    the last time that apple tried to launch a value product  the iphone 00NUMBER00 the device reportedly didnt do as well as the company had expected. conversely sales of the premium 00NUMBER00 performed better than expected leading supply constraints in the companys first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. however its worth noting a couple of pretty significant differences between the iphone 00NUMBER00 in late 00NUMBER00 and the iphone se in early 00NUMBER00. first of all the iphone 00NUMBER00 packaged up the prior generations internal components and camera subsystems in a less premium plastic shell. remember back then one of the key selling points of apples phones is that they were made out of aluminum and had a premium look and feel as a result. the iphone se stands in stark contrast to the iphone 00NUMBER00. it comes in a nice metal casing features top of the line internal components implements the same camera that the flagship 00NUMBER00 has and comes with support for apple pay. the iphone se also starts  at 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte model and goes to 00NUMBER00 for the decked out 00NUMBER00 gigabyte model. the iphone 00NUMBER00 started life 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte variant and went to 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 version. the iphone se clearly provides a much better relative value to both apples own flagship products than the 00NUMBER00 did some would perhaps argue that its too  close and to the competition. even with a small fairly old display the apple 00NUMBER00 is arguably the most powerful mobile system on chip in the market today. apple has a good product here    i believe that the iphone se looks like a solid product that offers a tremendous amount of value for the money especially relative to other members of the iphone lineup. this looks like a great product with which to lure out folks in mature markets that simply dont want a larger iphone as well as a solid tool with which to try to gain share in potentially more price sensitive emerging markets. the main risk that i see here is that apple could very well see a substitution of sales of higher pricedhigher margin iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones in favor of the iphone se. i plan to place an order for one as soon as it becomes available and hope to have a full review of the device published in early april. stay 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying.

the companys typical incremental update cycle for its devices. the biggest device announcement came in the form of apples new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se. the device has been rumored for some time but is now confirmed as the companys attempt to woo users who want high end specs on a smaller screen. the se sports nearly all of the same internals as the flagship 00NUMBER00 just in a smaller package. apple also shrunk down its gargantuan 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro with the release of a smaller 00NUMBER00 inch pro. the smaller pro has the same specs as its larger brother with only a few minor differences complete with apple pencil and smart keyboard compatibility and comes with a new paper white display. aside from those device changes apple announced a few software changes to tvos added carekit for developers to create new apps for tracking a users health in ios and dropped the price of the apple watch sport by 00NUMBER00. apple didnt shy away from its battle with the fbi over unlocking an iphone either. ceo tim cook spent some time at the event reiterating apples commitment to its users privacy. check the video below for all the details. a secret billion dollar stock

maker of consumer electronics introduced the iphone se earlier this week. going back to the form factor of the smaller 00NUMBER00 inch size of the iphone 00NUMBER00 may seem like equivalent of drawing a go back three spaces card in the evolutionary game of tech gadgets. the new smartphone available for preorder as of today and hitting the market a week from today is going to be the butt of easy jokes. however theres certainly going to be a market for the device that packs many of the features available of the current iphone 00NUMBER00 model. thats important. apple tends to keep the previous years model around at a lower price point but here its offering a phone with many of the same features at the iphone 00NUMBER00. it will just come in a smaller size and at a much smaller price point. the iphone 00NUMBER00 se starts at 00NUMBER00 considerably less than 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 at 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 plus model 00NUMBER00. shelling out 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 less for current generation iphone is going to be compelling. it will definitely cannibalize sales of the higher priced options but its also going to expand its reach with non ios owners and first time buyers that were thinking of going android. things are different now. a couple of years ago wireless carriers were willing to subsidize hundreds of dollars on a new iphone just to lock someone into a two year contract. its why so many people associated current model iphones with a 00NUMBER00 price point. thats toast. the leading telcos now charge the full retail price for devices letting folks pay them off in installments. this is a significant shift and it could be a big reason why the appetite for iphones has been waning lately. apple sold nearly 00NUMBER00 million iphones during the holiday quarter essentially flat with the 00NUMBER00 million it cleared a year earlier. with ipad and mac sales sliding the only reason that year over year revenue was up by a mere 00NUMBER00 for the period was the growth in apple services and new categories including its long overdue push into the smartwatch market. with  apple stock  closing lower last year the first time that weve seen that happen since 00NUMBER00 it isnt a surprise to see the class act of cupertino get aggressive here. it did little as the ipad and ipod started to fall from grace but it cant afford to sit still with its iphone empire meandering. you can call the apple se by any diminutive moniker you want but you may as well also call it sold. it will sell. it will push iphone unit counts higher again and right now thats a bit more important than what it will do to apples profit margins. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a

ipad pro is an excellent product that represents the ipad at its best. lets take a closer look at what the idevice maker delivered with its latest ipad. significant leap in camera performancequality    apples ipad lines have tended to use front and rear facing cameras that pale significantly to the camera subsystems found in the latest iphones. this was true of the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro that launched late last year but it no longer holds for 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. the new tablet comes packed with the same 00NUMBER00 megapixel front facing camera as well as the 00NUMBER00 megapixel rear facing camera that apple included in the iphone 00NUMBER00. the new pro does not appear to feature the optical image stabilization feature thats included in the rear camera of iphone 00NUMBER00 plus however. for users upgrading from older generation ipads even the ipad air 00NUMBER00 the improvement in camera capability should be quite significant. innovative new display    apple also revealed that the new ipad pro features an all new display. the display apple claims is made from the same metal oxide tft material that the display of the ipad pro is made of but with several enhancements. the first is that the new display is able to cover a wider color gamut the dci 00NUMBER00 gamut than the large ipad pros display can. according to apple this means that the new ipad can deliver 00NUMBER00 greater color saturation than prior generation ipad displays. next apple says that the new display reflects even less light than the prior generation ipad air 00NUMBER00 around 00NUMBER00 less. its worth noting that apple first introduced its anti reflective coating with the ipad air 00NUMBER00 so apple is taking something that was already best in class and making it meaningfully better. finally the display is a true tone display. the idea here is that using input from a couple of four channel ambient light sensors the new ipad can dynamically adjust the color temperature of the display to make it seem as though the display is reflecting  the light around it. a cut down 00NUMBER00 chip only two gigabytes of ram    although the new ipad includes the same 00NUMBER00 chip thats found in the larger ipad the chips performance is actually dialed back. modestly in terms of cpu performance but significantly in terms of graphics performance. additionally from the geekbench 00NUMBER00 performance scores that have hit the web its clear that memory performance is way  down. in the large ipad pro apple uses a quad channel memory configuration. i suspect that in dropping down from 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of memory to just 00NUMBER00 gigabytes in the new ipad pro apple also moved from using four memory channels to just two halving theoretical peak memory bandwidth. graphics performance is also substantially down. its not clear if the reduction in memory bandwidth was to accommodate a much slower graphics engine or if that reduction was a significant cause  of the graphics performance degradation. i suspect this is a case of a little column a and a little column b. that said the new ipads graphics performance is still substantially ahead of the ipad air 00NUMBER00 according to tests performed by ars technica. great device looking forward to buying one    after giving the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro a shot and subsequently returning it   i wrote that if apple put out an ipad air 00NUMBER00 with the 00NUMBER00 pro like quad speakers and an improved display id be excited to buy one and keep it. the ipad pro 00NUMBER00 inch meets andor exceeds my expectations in just about every category and as such i plan to put in an order for one as soon as apple makes them available on its online store. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable

of the devices. battery   tests of the battery in the iphone se shows its better than previous apple smartphones   appleinsider notes. the battery lasted for two hours longer than the iphone 00NUMBER00 when put under the same conditions. this is mostly due to the smaller screen size on the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone. powering a larger display puts more drain on the battery. however the iphone se also isnt sporting a display as good as its larger sibling. mac   some mac users are reporting problems after updating to os x 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. the problems facing some mac owners

the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone signifies an important strategic shift for the company that investors dont seem to be appreciating. im not just talking about the fact that the iphone se appears to be aggressively targeting first time smartphone buyers in emerging markets. heres how the iphone se is the first iphone of its kind. the old model is going out of style    for apple it has almost always used older models to address lower price points. many years ago apple adopted a strategy of cascading models down to successively lower price points. the primary benefit of this strategy was that apple could get an incredible amount of mileage for developing a single new iphone model per year. a new model could easily enjoy a product cycle of three years  or more in some cases   which is essentially unheard of in the smartphone market. that yielded great efficiencies with rd spending capital expenditures on tooling infrastructure and more. the biggest downside from a consumer perspective was that you always  had to pay up in order to get the latest and greatest tech. historically only the flagship models would include the fastest processors and other relevant specs. but not anymore. the iphone product strategy is evolving. latest greatest and most affordable    iphone se is the first time that the latest and greatest tech most notably the 00NUMBER00 chip with its embedded 00NUMBER00 is available at the lowest  starting price ever 00NUMBER00. even the iphone 00NUMBER00 which starts at 00NUMBER00 higher price point uses an 00NUMBER00 with a discrete 00NUMBER00 motion coprocessor. the company has never made its newest technology this affordable and this is the shift that im talking about. of course the main trade off comes in the display size but thats also a matter of consumer preference. its not as if 00NUMBER00 inch display is inherently better  than a 00NUMBER00 inch display even if it is more expensive. a lot of people still prefer smaller phones and for consumers that are content to remain in that market segment the iphone se is an incredibly strong product. no longer are they relegated to older generations of iphones. ipad implications    this shift has some potential implications for the ipad family too specifically the minis. the minis have always been the most affordable ipads in part due to the smaller display and form factor. but apples track record with how powerful it makes the mini is mixed. the original mini initially shipped with a previous generation 00NUMBER00 processor. ipad mini 00NUMBER00 launched with a then current 00NUMBER00 but mini 00NUMBER00 added only touch id and the mini 00NUMBER00 currently ships with a previous generation 00NUMBER00. if apple implements the new strategy with the ipad line it could strengthen the mini family by similarly including the latest tech and specs at the most affordable price points. moving on down   jpmorgan analyst rod hall recently noted that apple had very little market share to speak of in the sub 00NUMBER00 segment. there were an estimated 00NUMBER00 million units in the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 segment last year and apple is now poised to grab significant share there with the se. previously only second hand iphones could potentially address that segment whereas now apple is jumping in directly. grabbing a conservative 00NUMBER00 of this segment would translate into 00NUMBER00 million incremental iphone units and these sales should be incrementally additive since apple has never directly played in this market before. and cannibalization risks are modest since there have always been secondhand iphones available to consumers in this segment. those consumers will just now be buying new models that will be included in apples results. a secret

inch ipad pro and the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad mini 00NUMBER00 to update  the 00NUMBER00 inch version of its popular tablet line. apple is finally releasing a new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad. image source apple. on monday apple finally announced its newest 00NUMBER00 inch ipad which will also be called the ipad pro and will have features similar to its larger sibling. apple marketing chief phil schiller described it as the ultimate upgrade for existing ipad users at the launch event. indeed the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro may represent apples best chance to reinvigorate ipad sales. apple needed a new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad    apple has broadened its ipad lineup in the past few years yet the classic 00NUMBER00 inch screen size remains by far the most popular among ipad users. nearly 00NUMBER00 of total ipad usage still comes from 00NUMBER00 inch models according to fiksu. as a result the lack of an ipad air 00NUMBER00 had a depressing effect on ipad sales last quarter. ipad unit sales fell 00NUMBER00 over year to 00NUMBER00 million. that was nearly 00NUMBER00 million units below apples peak holiday quarter ipad sales total of 00NUMBER00 from just two years earlier. if apple experiences a similar 00NUMBER00 decline during the current quarter it would post its lowest quarterly ipad sales total since 00NUMBER00. while apple has fresh products for 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch ipad form factors it clearly needs an upgraded 00NUMBER00 inch ipad to get sales back on track. the ipad pro is a big upgrade over its predecessor    the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro offers big improvements over the ipad 00NUMBER00. first its 00NUMBER00 processor delivers 00NUMBER00 times higher cpu performance and twice the graphics performance of the 00NUMBER00 chip found in the ipad air 00NUMBER00. independent tests have verified 00NUMBER00 chips extremely high performance. the ipad air 00NUMBER00 is much less powerful than the new ipad pro. image source apple. second the display is 00NUMBER00 brighter and 00NUMBER00 less reflective than the ipad air 00NUMBER00 display. it also incorporates apples new true tone display technology that adjusts contrast based on ambient light. these features should make it a lot easier to read on an ipad. apple has also improved the front and rear cameras and replaced the two speaker audio system with a significantly more powerful four speaker system. finally the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro will be compatible with the new apple pencil stylus and will have an optional smart keyboard cover. the optional stylus and keyboard could help apple sell the smaller ipad pro to businesses that need the extra functionality those accessories provide. apple is in the midst of a big push to sell more ipads to enterprise customers. that was one of the major reasons why it developed the larger ipad pro. now it will be able to offer potential customers two size options with roughly equivalent performance. upgrade time    the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro thus offers some major improvements relative to the ipad air 00NUMBER00. but ipad air 00NUMBER00 users arent the main target market for this new ipad. instead apples biggest opportunity is the large pool of customers using older ipads. there are likely 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 pre ipad air devices still in use. most of these ipads are 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 years old making them ripe for replacement. the new ipad pro offers exponential performance improvements over these older devices which are multiple generations behind the ipad air 00NUMBER00. it is also significantly lighter weighing in at less than a pound compared to nearly 00NUMBER00 pounds for some of the older models. thus there are a lot of reasons for people to upgrade their older ipads  to the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. as a result i expect the ipad product line to return to strong growth in apples upcoming third fiscal quarter. but if the new ipad pro isnt enough to entice users to upgrade their older ipads then perhaps the market really has moved beyond tablets. either way we will probably learn a lot during the next year about the ipads future prospects. a secret billion dollar stock

has been a lot of grumbling among apple  customers around the fact that the base storage models of its iphones still come with a paltry 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of nand flash. as my fellow foolish colleague evan niu points out   this is an excellent upsell strategy on apples part that has helped contribute to the noticeable increase in iphone average selling prices. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 i believe that apple will retain its current storage tier structure of 00NUMBER00 gigabytes. however i think with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus andor the rumored pro apple will actually go ahead and change things up a bit. allow me to explain. did you see what apple did with the ipad pro    with the ipad pro apple offers three storage tiers. the base model starts at 00NUMBER00 gigabytes with two higher priced models offering 00NUMBER00 gigabytes and 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage respectively. i think this is a harbinger of what to expect from the larger iphones this fall. for the regular iphone 00NUMBER00 plus i could see apple offering storage capacities of 00NUMBER00 gigabytes 00NUMBER00 gigabytes and 00NUMBER00 at the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 price points respectively. for the iphone 00NUMBER00 pro i could see apple offering variants with 00NUMBER00 gb 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb just as weve seen with the ipad pro models. these phones could sell for 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. certainly quite pricey so they had better be best in class across the board but there are certainly many iphone buyers who are fairly price insensitive and simply want the best iphones that money can buy. heres why this pricing structure would work nicely    the goal of apples pricing structures has always been to try to convince customers that for each additional 00NUMBER00 spent moving up a tier apple is actually giving an incrementally better value. indeed if we look at the pricing structure for the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple gives the customer an extra 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage for the first 00NUMBER00 but an additional 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage for 00NUMBER00. the pricing scheme that i suggested above would have a similar effect. in going from the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus to 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 pro the customer not only gets an extra 00NUMBER00 of storage but a superior camera. the value of the iphone pro increases vis a vis the vanilla iphone plus model when we get to the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte storage tier where the incremental cost of an ostensibly better camera subsystem works out to just 00NUMBER00. and of course for customers that find that even 00NUMBER00 is not enough for their needs only the iphone pro in this case would give them the extra 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage that they want. one has to figure that the kind of person that would need that much storage space in a phone is the same kind of person that would be taking a lot of 00NUMBER00 videos with herhis phone meaning that theyd probably want the better dual camera subsystem anyway. apple has an interesting opportunity here    in a world where smartphone upgrade cycles are set to lengthen apple is best served by trying to extract as much revenue per unit at the high end as possible. introducing higher tiers of iphones with additional featuresstorage capacities is in my mind the right thing to do to capitalize on this opportunity. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry

stock advice trading tipsas is usually the case with apple inc. aapl    product launches the new iphone se has attracted initial praise from tech enthusiasts. consensus seems to be that  apple stock  s decision to bring back the small form factor while loading the phone with state of the art mobile technologies is a good decision. the initial praise is valid. after all apple made the new iphone to have the same processor with iphone 00NUMBER00. its rear camera is a 00NUMBER00 isight camera the same offered in iphone 00NUMBER00. iphone se offers the apple 00NUMBER00 processor the same as is offered in iphone 00NUMBER00. iphone 00NUMBER00 offers apple 00NUMBER00 processor. its 00NUMBER00 ram is the same as present in iphone 00NUMBER00 higher than 00NUMBER00 ram in iphone 00NUMBER00. it also has a fingerprint sensor. for all the similar specifications that the iphone se shares with iphone 00NUMBER00 costing about 00NUMBER00 less initial consensus should be that it will perform well in the market. however its not very likely that the new iphone se will drastically improve iphone sales which apple stock already expects to decline  in the first quarter of this year. id point you to two reasons why the iphone se might not sell well. and these two points find their root in the fact that aapl is trying to make cheaper phones which makes sense on the surface. here we go. gartner recently said in study  that smartphones now sell at the slowest pace since 00NUMBER00 owing to smartphone saturation in matured markets like most in the west. by implication phone makers are now looking to emerging markets like the latin american countries for growth. on the surface it would seem iphone se would be a favorite choice in the emerging markets since these regions are seeing increasing growth  rate of smartphone adoption. but as the name sounds folks in the emerging markets are well just emerging economically. implicatively while they can afford more luxury than ever they are not so wealthy on the average that they can adopt the iphone se en mass. you want to bear in mind that most phones in emerging markets are below the 00NUMBER00 threshold. in fact kevin walsh of gfk once told the telegraph  that the reason for emerging market dominance of smartphone growth in the next year 00NUMBER00 is that pricing is reaching the sweet spot of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. going by that number the average smartphone price in emerging markets is about eight to 00NUMBER00 times less than the price tag apple stocks places on iphone se. so to say that the iphone se will be a massive success in emerging markets would be a shot too far. and lets not forget the preference for larger screens in the emerging markets too. yes there will be many buyers in these regions but the growth potential in this region for aapl is a bit overstated at current economic levels. the wall street journal  reported after the launch of iphone se that the phrase cheapest iphone in history was trending  on chinese social media site weibo. in fact they were comparing it to xiaomi  s budget phone redmi. the thing is apple stock has already built a reputation for itself as a phone maker for the high end market. so the perception that the iphone se is cheap wont help it at the beginning as it sends a wrong message that it is substandard. and in matured markets like u. s. lower price isnt going to motivate consumers to buy the phone. investors shouldnt get too excited about the launch of iphone se based on the reasons discussed above. the only positive for the long term is that it could give emerging market consumers a taste of what aapl offers with the iphone thereby positioning apple stock to do well in these regions as when they can afford more luxury spending. this aside though the potential failure here doesnt condemn aapl to a sell list. as i have discussed  a number of time this year apple stock a strong enough powerhouse to weather mini failures like this. and the stock is still trading at a discount to its free cash flow. as of this writing craig adeyanju did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the post apple inc. stock why the iphone se could falter in emerging markets aapl  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  the iphone se. image credit apple. i have to admit when apple  announced the price points of its new iphone se lineup i was a little bit shocked. the device which is practically save for a few minor items an iphone 00NUMBER00 on the inside and an iphone 00NUMBER00 on the outside is priced at just 00NUMBER00 for the model with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage and 00NUMBER00 for a version with a 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage. in my mind this phone has virtually destroyed the value propositions offered by the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus which start 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 for models with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage respectively. although the move is risky i believe that there is real method to apples apparent madness here. lets take a closer look at it. the current choices    the idea of a 00NUMBER00 iphone with flagship internal specifications is certainly going to be appealing to many. that said for all of the features and computing power that the iphone se brings to the table there will be those who simply must have larger screen smartphones. before the iphone se arrived those customers could choose between the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models or the newer 00NUMBER00 plus and doing so seemed like a sensible way to save a few bucks. after all if somebody just wanted a larger iphone but didnt want to pay extra for the better internal specifications there was no shame in getting the iphone 00NUMBER00. however with the iphone se sitting there at 00NUMBER00 substantially better specifications in virtually every relevant area a customer who doesnt want a smaller screen device might feel a little bit silly paying more  for larger but generally inferior devices. the solution to this customers dilemma would be to buy either the iphone 00NUMBER00 or the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. sure theyre more expensive than their iphone 00NUMBER00 plus counterparts but they come with the best of the iphone se the best of the iphone 00NUMBER00 well as several significant additions on top. in other words the perceived  value proposition of the higher end iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus may have actually increased as a result of the introduction of the iphone se. beyond the next six months    the iphone se is only really a potential problem for the middle tier of apples smartphones for say the next six months or so. once the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones launch the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will likely be retired in mature markets though potentially kept around  for price sensitive emerging markets. this means that apples stack will look far more natural by that time. iphone se at 00NUMBER00 with the iphone 00NUMBER00 picking up where the se leaves off at 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones would then occupy the traditional high end price points. i suspect that the iphone se will not  see an update next fall as the iphone se really does perfectly fit the notion of a price reduced but still awesome variant of the iphone 00NUMBER00. my expectation is that the next 00NUMBER00 inch iphone should the iphone se do well enough in the marketplace to warrant a refresh will come in the spring of 00NUMBER00 presumably following the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00. it will be interesting to see what specifications apple would bring to such a device at that time should it materialize. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion

just announced its latest 00NUMBER00 inch iphone the iphone se. the device is an interesting product because it packs the performance of the iphone 00NUMBER00 into a compact iphone 00NUMBER00 esque shell at what could only be described as a bargain price. sure the iphone se doesnt include all  of the latest technologies found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 the wi fi and cellular chips are slower the display is still 00NUMBER00 and lacks 00NUMBER00 touch and there isnt a 00NUMBER00 gigabyte option. the nice thing about the se being a cheaper iphone is that should apple continue the series it becomes almost predictable what to expect from future iterations. in this article id like to offer up my educated guesses on what we will see in the next iteration of the iphone se. first things first when will we see it    i dont think that we will see an update to the iphone se later this year or even next spring. the iphone se is very much a cost reduced iphone 00NUMBER00 so itll still be plenty relevant once the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones come out and the iphone 00NUMBER00 serve as apples mid range devices. indeed my expectation is that the next generation iphone se will arrive in the spring of 00NUMBER00. the key improvements    apple has shown that it is willing to put its best processor inside of the se smart given that apple probably wont refresh these devices on a yearly cadence so expect apple to equip this device with the 00NUMBER00 chip that will find its way into the iphone 00NUMBER00. the next se will almost certainly receive 00NUMBER00 touch support although the feature is not huge today after a couple of generations it will probably be very tough to sell a new iphone without the feature. so expect this to be added to the next generation se. additionally the display found on the current generation se is now three and a half years old having first made its debut on the iphone 00NUMBER00. i expect that the next iphone se will incorporate some of the key technology improvements found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 series displays better contrast ratio wider viewing angles and so on but not much else beyond that. even a display resolution increase might be pushing it. furthermore apple is likely to include faster wi ficellular components particularly as chips substantially faster than what todays iphone se has should be quite cheap approximately two years from now. next apple is likely to migrate from the first generation touch id which made its debut in the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 to the second generation touch id that arrived in the iphone 00NUMBER00 series. finally i dont expect apple to make significant changes to the industrial design. the company could opt to make the product a little bit thinner or it could make the phone look more like the iphone 00NUMBER00. that said the response that im seeing on a lot of the apple centric message boards is that potential iphone se buyers seem to prefer  the iphone ses industrial design over that of the iphone 00NUMBER00 of phones. people also seem to be quite enthusiastic about the great battery life numbers the se has apparently been putting up perhaps making the device thinner at the expense of battery capacity is the wrong move for this class of device. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to

to a single point original content. and as the massive shifts  within the music industry continues to unfold apple recently inked another original content deal with none other than vice media. vice media comes to apple music    recently news broke that apple and canadian american media outlet vice media  had reached a deal to make vices documentary series the score   available exclusively through apple media. the six episode series will purportedly delve into some of the most far flung and interesting music scenes in the world. the first episode  chronicles members of the fledgling hip hop scene among the ojibwe native american tribe in minnesota. this move largely mimics apples other recent original content moves. in addition to the score   it was earlier reported that apple had financed the music video for drakes hotling bling  single and taylor 00NUMBER00 which follows the pop star while on tour. crucially apple required both content pieces remain exclusively at least for a certain length of time on apple music as part of its financing agreements. likewise the score   is only available for apple music subscribers. additionally word surfaced last month that apple is also quietly developing  its first original tv series with hip hop legend and apple executive dr. dre under the working title vital signs. in sum these moves pretty clearly demonstrate apple musics strategy to acquire users bait them with exclusive content. but is it workingstrategy success   in considering whether its exclusive content strategy remains the correct course of action it seems like apple with all its marketing muscle is capable of making a more concerted push to popularize its new streaming music service. image source apple. it doesnt appear that apple is making anything even remotely approaching a concerted effort to publicize its exclusive content offerings which is particularly troublesome. granted apples total log of exclusive content some of which has become publicly available more recently totaled a paltry three offerings. that doesnt provide much in the way of fodder around which apple could create a marketing campaign. however apples overall lack of activity in both expanding its exclusive video content backlog and also promoting it suggests something isnt clicking at apple music. the lack of urgency in executing its strategy also coincides with strong product development efforts from apples key streaming music rival spotify. perhaps driven by its underdog status against apple spotify has launched a number of impressive features including in app concert booking and a growing catalog of non exclusive video content from the likes of espn comedy central mtv the bbc ted talks and many more. though it only debuted late last june apple music has reportedly surpassed 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers. compared to spotifys recently updated 00NUMBER00 million paying member figure apple music doesnt necessarily look like a flop. however the corollary is that it doesnt look like a resounding success either especially because apple already has more than 00NUMBER00 million itunes accounts to which it can market apple music. perhaps the addition of vices new series represents the start of a more concerted exclusive content push on apples end. only time will tell. however based on the information available today something seems off with apple musics marketing plan. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

essentially replacing the iphone 00NUMBER00. of course its guts are significantly improved compared to the 00NUMBER00. the phones selling point is its price. with its smaller four inch display compared to apple  s flagship 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus the company is able to offer the phone at a significant discount. the iphone se has a starting price of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 less than the starting price of apples iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. the phones bang for your buck value proposition makes it a good buy in markets where the price of smartphones is more important to buyers. china in particular is one of these markets. fortunately if this new data from cnbc is true the new se appears to be off to a solid start in the important market. apple has garnered more than 00NUMBER00 million pre orders from retailers in china for its new iphone se. this is a particularly big number since it doesnt include pre orders made directly through apple. for some context apple announced after its iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch that it had sold more than 00NUMBER00 million new models in the three days following the launch. while this isnt an apples to apples comparison since it compares preorders to sales it does highlight strong demand for the phone in china. over three million preorders from china retailers alone excluding preorders made directly through apple suggests the new phones first weekend sales will be robust. shipments for apples iphone se will begin on thursday march 00NUMBER00. so the first apples to apples comparison may come around monday april 00NUMBER00 assuming the company keeps with its usual method of reporting first weekend sales at the beginning of the week following the launch. iphone se image source apple. a mid cycle boost   what stands out most about this iphone launch is how it departs from the companys usual practice of sticking to its once a year announcement of flagship smartphones. further the companys decision to give one of its lower cost devices an overhaul in between its flagship iphone launches highlights apples growing emphasis of faster growing emerging markets as u. s. canada and european markets mature. beyond any data on preorders and first weekend iphone sales for the new model investors will be looking to see whether or not the new iphone can prevent apples sales from a potential year over year decline during the second half of the year. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show

larger screen iphone 00NUMBER00 plus devices that launched back in sept. 00NUMBER00. if that assumption is correct then assuming an average selling price of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 split between the 00NUMBER00 model and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 model this works out to incremental revenue of approximately 00NUMBER00 billion. given that the iphone se likely required truly minimal research and development spending all major components recycled from the iphone 00NUMBER00 series to create this would appear to be quite a good showing for the idevice maker. its not just china where the se is likely doing well    although the report from cnbc talks specifically about china there are some early signs that demand might be robust here in the united states as well. when i went to pre order my iphone se 00NUMBER00 gigabyte unlocked rose gold apple indicated that the device would arrive on 00NUMBER00. however all of the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte unlocked models that im seeing on apples online store show that via the fastest shipping method a device ordered today will arrive between april 00NUMBER00 and april 00NUMBER00. it could very well be that apple simply didnt build a lot of these ahead of the launch but i wouldnt be surprised if it were the case that a significant portion of the iphone installed base was simply holding off upgrading from older phones until a newer smaller model arrived. will we get a press release talking about how sales went    traditionally after apple puts an iphone up for sale it will follow the initial couple of days of orders with a press release talking about how many units of the new models it sold in that period. with the se i dont think apple will issue a press release giving sales figures. however i do think that if demand for the se turns out to be strong and as long as those sales are generally incremental  rather than cannibalistic   this could be reflected in the guidance that apple issues next month for the june quarter. the se is a good product no surprise if it does well    at the end of the day i think that the iphone se is a very solid product that ultimately allows apple to attack price points that it wasnt able to really address previously. 00NUMBER00 phone thats virtually on par with its flagships aside from the display and a few other minor things wi ficellular speeds touch id speed etc. represents a very interesting value proposition one that could help apple gain share and ultimately bolster iphone revenue. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are

2016-03-30 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.5905894171449348,0.217401008349607,-0.0007888396862881,the past 00NUMBER00 months have been interesting for apple  stock with shares soaring as high as 00NUMBER00 and falling as 00NUMBER00. and shares could see another reason to move up or down soon when the company reports fiscal second quarter results in april. the report which just received a firm date of monday april 00NUMBER00 will likely mark the companys first year over year revenue decline in years. how will investors respondahead of apples second quarter report heres a preview of some of the items investors will likely watch when the company reports results. revenue  when apple reported fiscal first quarter results earlier this year the company said it expected revenue of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. interestingly this range is significantly below the 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue the company reported during the second quarter of 00NUMBER00. the sudden expectation for a year over year decline in revenue has some investors concerned. but investors should keep in mind that these levels of revenue for 00NUMBER00 still represent significant growth from where apple was two years ago. 00NUMBER00 revenue in 00NUMBER00 was 00NUMBER00 billion a march quarter record at the time. following the huge success of its iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in fiscal 00NUMBER00 its likely that apple may struggle to post year over year growth for the entire fiscal year of 00NUMBER00. iphone sales  apples expectation for a year over year decline in revenue 00NUMBER00 inevitably leads to an analysis of iphone sales. with iphone sales representing 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in its most recent quarter the segment is apples most significant driver of revenue resulting in the direction of overall revenue generally reflecting the direction of iphone sales. its likely therefore that management is modeling for its iphone sales to reflect the overall year over year revenue decline it is expecting or even worse. if iphone sales for the current quarter were to decline anywhere between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 during 00NUMBER00 unit sales would be about between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. gross profit margin  apple management provided guidance for its closely watched gross profit margin metric for 00NUMBER00 of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 a range below the companys gross profit margin of 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. with the companys iphone unit sales for 00NUMBER00 to be lower than the year ago quarter the expected decline in apples gross profit margin makes sense the company has said its iphone segment is its most profitable segment. iphone se image source apple. iphone se  one area investors will likely hone in on when the company reports second quarter results is any mention of how well the tech giants new iphone se  is fairing in the market. launched ahead of apples typical september flagship iphone refreshes and priced 00NUMBER00 lower than the starting price for its flagship iphone 00NUMBER00 the overhauled lower cost phone marks a new strategy for the company. could the companys decision to strengthen its lower cost offering offset year over year declines for the rest of the yearof course investors should keep in mind that the march launched iphone se wont likely have a significant impact on iphone sales for the current quarter since deliveries dont begin until march 00NUMBER00 the last day of 00NUMBER00. still with apples second quarter report taking place more than three weeks 00NUMBER00 management will likely have more insight when it reports second quarter results into just how much of an impact the phone can have on iphone sales this year. ultimately investors will be watching to see whether 00NUMBER00 guidance and commentary might signal more tough year over year comparisons ahead or provide hope for a return to growth in the near future. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

ipad pro the companys largest and at the time most advanced tablet computer. at its march 00NUMBER00 press event apple filled out its ipad pro lineup with a cheaper smaller version of the ipad pro with a 00NUMBER00 inch display. having multiple sizes of its flagship ipad pro lineup certainly makes sense. however its hard to ignore the fact that despite being significantly more expensive the larger ipad pro isnt in all respects better  than the smaller one. where the larger model wins    although both tablets use apples 00NUMBER00 processor the 00NUMBER00 chip inside of the smaller ipad pro runs both the cpu and graphics processor at lower speeds. this is likely due to the fact that the larger ipad pro packs a larger battery meaning the chip can consume more power while keeping battery in check as well as the fact that the larger pro is larger in all critical dimensions allowing it to handle the additional heat output of the more powerful chip. the larger ipad pro also packs in four gigabytes of system memory twice that of the smaller device. i count two significant wins for the larger ipad pro although in day to day usage these differences are unlikely to matter for most usersuse cases. where the smaller model wins    although the larger ipad pro does get a few in on the smaller one the smaller one does far more than that. for one thing the smaller ipad pro features a significantly  better display than the larger one by way of being both far brighter and supporting a wider color gamut. on top of that the smaller pro comes with what is called a true tone display which senses the color temperature of ambient light and adjusts the color temperature of the display to match. beyond that the smaller pro has a substantially better camera subsystem the same one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and is significantly thinner 00NUMBER00 millimeters versus 00NUMBER00. thats three wins for the smaller ipad pro with each of them very difficult to miss. apple is in a corner this time around course correction should come with ipad pro 00NUMBER00 is placed in this position because the large ipad pro that we ultimately got in late 00NUMBER00 was apparently  originally targeted for early 00NUMBER00 using an 00NUMBER00 chip. had it come out then rather than in late 00NUMBER00 apple would almost certainly have refreshed the larger pro in early 00NUMBER00 along with the introduction of the smaller model. for now though i think that apple is simply going to ride it out with the current large ipad pro until early 00NUMBER00. apple could do a mid cycle update to bring the larger pro more in line with its smaller sibling but without a new processor such an update probably wouldnt be worthwhile. in early 00NUMBER00 i expect apple to roll out new ipads with virtual feature parity using a new 00NUMBER00 processor. apple seems pretty bent on saving the ipad so dont be surprised if you see the idevice maker being even more  aggressive about delivering increasingly large year over year technology leaps with its ipad line. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to

 event the apple watch was overshadowed by new iphone and ipad models and updated tools for healthcare applications. however tim cook did announce that the apple watch was getting a price cut. the cheapest model now costs 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00. the apple watch is now 00NUMBER00 cheaper than before. photo applethe price cut has some pundits worried that the apple watch is selling very poorly. but while it hasnt been a smash hit the first generation watch has put in a credible performance  and the upcoming next gen model should be able to build on that foundation. moderate first year sales performance    apple has never released official sales figures for the apple watch. however third party reports from canalys and idc both suggest that apple watch shipments totaled about 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00. these sales estimates seem reasonably accurate based on the revenue trend for apples other products category. if so it means that sales fell short of many analysts expectations. 00NUMBER00 million sales in the first year was a fairly common estimate. the apple watch didnt ship until april 00NUMBER00 wasnt a full year of sales but that wasnt a difference maker. however in comparison to previous new apple products the watchs performance doesnt look too bad. in the iphones 00NUMBER00 months on the market apple sold about 00NUMBER00 million units. for the ipads first 00NUMBER00 months it sold about 00NUMBER00 million. apple watch sales will end up somewhere in between. furthermore apple smoked the competition in 00NUMBER00 grabbing more than half of the smartwatch market. it still needs to convince a lot more customers that they should buy a smartwatch but none of its would be rivals are in a position to eat apples lunch. what about that price cut    the recent apple watch price cut isnt really a desperation move either. most people dont remember it now but the iphone got 00NUMBER00 price cut  a few months after being launched in 00NUMBER00. that didnt stop it from becoming a global smash hit in the following years. apple now regularly cuts the prices of year old iphone and ipad models by 00NUMBER00. apple routinely reduces the prices of its iphone models as they age. photo applethe apple watch was first unveiled 00NUMBER00 months ago and has been on sale for nearly a year. tech products dont gain value with age so it shouldnt have been a big surprise that apple was ready to drop its price. will the apple watch 00NUMBER00 drive growth    even with a new starting price of 00NUMBER00 the apple watch isnt likely to fly off the shelves during the next few months. while many watch owners are very satisfied with their purchase the first generation device clearly has limitations. battery life has been an issue for many users and apple should be able to make improvements there for the apple watch 00NUMBER00. fans and critics alike have come up with numerous other ways that apple could make the apple watch better. history shows that this is an opportunity more than a problem. it might be hard to imagine now but the original iphone didnt have an app store that only came with the iphone 00NUMBER00. and the app store launched with a paltry 00NUMBER00 apps. obviously its possible that the apple watch will never really catch on. but its way too early to make that call. apple has huge opportunities to improve the watch over the next few years. as it gains new functionality it will be able to meet the needs of more and more consumers. apple investors just need to be patient as this process plays out. a secret billion dollar stock

opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image credit apple. a recent report from kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo claims that apple  is gearing up for a significant overhaul with the 00NUMBER00 iphone which could either be called the iphone 00NUMBER00 or the iphone 00NUMBER00. the device will apparently move away from a metal casing and toward a fusion of metal and glass include wireless charging additional biometric functions and more. it sounds exactly  like the kind of major overhaul that one may have expected with the iphone thats expected to come out later this year. interestingly the fact that apple is apparently planning to bring a major overhaul to the 00NUMBER00 iphone has many investors and apple watchers wondering whether the iphone 00NUMBER00 will wind up being a minor update to the iphone 00NUMBER00. i believe that even if the iphone 00NUMBER00 winds up looking like a slimmer iphone 00NUMBER00 with less annoying antenna band as rumored it can still represent a substantial upgrade from the 00NUMBER00. heres how. massive display improvement    the displays on both the 00NUMBER00 plus are in very dire need of upgrades. although the premium variant of the 00NUMBER00 iphone that kuo described is expected to see a shift to an oled display which would be a huge jump i still believe a big display upgrade is in the cards this year even if apple sticks to traditional lcd technology. there are five vectors that i would like to see improved upon in the new displayshigher display resolution for greater 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 for the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 for the iphone 00NUMBER00 color gamut for richer more vivid colorstrue tone technology so that images look more natural in many different lighting situationsimproved contrast ratiolow screen light reflectanceapple has already introduced four of the five improvements listed above with the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. since the ipad is generally a less important device to apple than the iphone is its usually not long before ipad exclusive technologies make it into the iphone. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 i think that if apple is able to implement the enhancements that i outlined above the display improvement alone should be worth the price of admission especially for users coming from the older iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. third gen touch id second gen 00NUMBER00 touch significant camera improvements internal updates    in addition to better screens apple is likely going to make significant improvements to a number of key technologies. for one thing i expect apple to roll out a third generation touch id that will be even quicker than the already lightning fast one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. i also wouldnt be surprised to see a second generation 00NUMBER00 touch  implemented as well. next and perhaps more significantly i believe that apple is planning a substantial camera upgrade for the 00NUMBER00 series of phones. early leaksrenders show that the camera holes in the iphone 00NUMBER00 chassis will be larger than the one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 which suggests that apple will be employing a larger sensor. i also expect a move from a five element lens to a six element lens in addition to many other improvements to the optics to go along with the improved sensor. the larger screen iphone is said to come in both a single and dual camera lens configurations too. finally apple is likely to bring significant internal improvements to the iphone 00NUMBER00 in the form of a faster 00NUMBER00 faster and in the case of the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 memory and perhaps other improvements here and there. all told apple has solid room for improvement    the current iphones are nice but theres still plenty for apple to do. the company has a golden opportunity to deliver a knockout of a phone with the iphone 00NUMBER00 by implementing the improvements enumerated above. if it does then the iphone may very well return to growth in the coming fiscal year. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and

possible to its own media platforms. the company is quietly developing a series with music industry heavyweight will. i. am. an interesting project to be sure but will apples efforts here actually move the needle for the firm lets take a look. an apple and a black eyed pea   according to a flurry of reporting late last week  the cupertino based tech giant has enlisted an elite group of entertainment industry talents to help develop its first unscripted series. in addition to the aforementioned will. i. am apple has also reportedly received commitments from tv execs including ben silverman and howard owens. though most readers have likely never heard of either silverman or owens the duo are certainly hollywood heavy hitters. in addition to serving stints at media industry stalwarts the william morris agency and nbc entertainment silverman founded two production and distribution companies  reveille and electus that produced shows such as the office   the biggest loser   ugly betty   and others. in addition to working with silverman at reveille howard owens  also worked for the william morris agency and most recently served as the president of national geographic channels. production talent aside it appears apples first unscripted series will focus on the app economy the company famously helped create. beyond that virtually no details for apples project have become public. the news could reflect an accelerated cadence in apples content development efforts though. last week news that apple sealed an exclusive content deal  with vice media also gained attention in tech and entertainment circles. however though its gradually expanding scope appears beneficial im still not sure im sold on apples exclusive content strategy. not nearly enough    given apples penchant for secrecy its hard to tell exactly what the tech giant hopes to achieve with its original content. considering the painfully gradual pace of its development though it seems as if apple might not be so clear about its strategy in this arena either. as far as i can tell the eventual addition of the will. i. am series will increase the number of apples original or exclusive content titles to a grand total of five though drakes hotline bling  video is no longer under exclusive status with apple. for context the other exclusive or original pieces under apples control and available through an apple music subscription are the documentary chronicling taylor 00NUMBER00 the vice media series the score   and  vital signs. that catalog doesnt do much to move the companys content library beyond licensed music especially as music streaming leader spotify continues to add unique features and grow its paid and free user bases. in all honesty it seems as if apples growth strategy for apple music has lost its direction. source spotifyapple musics original marketing plan centered around two points of differentiation over spotify curation and original content. apple spent months prior to musics launch recruiting top music industry talent to curate playlists and dj for apple music stations. spotify effectively negated this advantage when it rolled out its own algorithm driven music recommendation playlists only weeks after apple music launched. this left exclusive content as the sole unique marketable feature for apple music albeit a weak one to begin with. however given the snails pace at which apple has acquired or created that content it seems the company doesnt have a strong sense of exactly what its doing to help promote its music streaming service. fortunately for apple the counterpoint is that this isnt likely to really affect its financial performance to an appreciable degree especially in the near term. true listening to music remains one of the most common things people use their smartphones for today  and the rise of popular alternatives weakens apples grip on its users mobile experience. however the companys death grip on other core aspects of the mobile experience particularly the app economy its forthcoming series will highlight means that losing the battle for streaming music dominance alone wont meaningfully impact its iphone and ipad sales outlook. but for a company whose current success is rooted so deeply in leading the evolution of digital music its unfortunate to see apples music product efforts appear as listless as they do today. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a

nasdaq inc.  iphone se. image source apple. a number of folks on various apple   centric web forums appear to be disappointed that the idevice maker didnt release a variant of its new iphone se with 00NUMBER00 of storage. in this article id like to explain precisely why apple opted not to do so offering only versions with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes or 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage space. a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone se would wreak havoc on iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales    many apple customers enjoy the fact that the company now offers phones with large 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch displays especially after the idevice maker famously resisted the trend toward such larger screen iphones for years. however there are still many potential apple customers who much prefer smaller screen devices. apple delivered a nice 00NUMBER00 inch iphone refresh with the iphone se. it packs iphone 00NUMBER00 computing power and iphone 00NUMBER00 class wireless connectivity technology representing substantial improvements vis a vis the aging iphone 00NUMBER00 that had previously been in the companys lineup. its also relatively inexpensive with the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte model priced at just 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte model coming in 00NUMBER00. at these prices the se may very well cannibalize the 00NUMBER00 plus to a noticeable degree at least among customers who care more about internal specifications and performance than on screen sizequality. theres also risk that the iphone se could cannibalize the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus but this seems less likely to me customers that are ok with spending 00NUMBER00 plus on a smartphone probably arent going to bother with the value iphone se unless they absolutely must  have a 00NUMBER00 inch smartphone. a 00NUMBER00 iphone se with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage would be a potential game changer and not in a good way for apple. it costs 00NUMBER00 for an iphone 00NUMBER00 with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of memory an iphone 00NUMBER00 plus with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of memory or an iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of memory. without a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone se there customers will probably gravitate to the iphone 00NUMBER00 since it is the newest most feature packed device at the 00NUMBER00 price point. at 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone se could very well become a too good to ignore value given the substantial amount of storage that one gets for that price. it would not only lead to further cannibalization of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus but it could hurt sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 line. yet another reason    another major reason that apple didnt offer a 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone se is due to the simple fact that in six months the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones will be discounted and moved to the mid tier of apples product lineup. as is customary the 00NUMBER00 options for these devices will likely be removed and it will only be offered in 00NUMBER00 gigabyte configurations. since the iphone se really is a smallerbudget iphone 00NUMBER00 would be faced with a dilemma does it keep the 00NUMBER00 se in the lineup when even the mid tier doesnt have such options the most sensible answer in that case would be no. can you imagine the customer uproar if apple were to introduce such a model only to discontinue it six months later it wouldnt be pretty.

watch has done very well by smartwatch standards with digitimes reporting  that the idevice maker commands more than 00NUMBER00 of the entire smartwatch market. that being said the publication reports that shipments of the current generation apple watch have been weaker than expected. this isnt a surprise given that apple recently cut the price of its entry level apple watch to 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00 prior without introducing updated models. apparently this weakness has led apple to be cautious about placing component orders for the second generation model slated for launch later in 00NUMBER00 digitimessays. moreover the publication also says that companies within the apple watch supply chain think that its likely that apple watch shipments in 00NUMBER00 are likely to be lower than those 00NUMBER00. not surprising    this report should it prove true isnt particularly surprising. many of the reviews of the apple watch clearly point to a product category thats still very much work in progress. one review   from wearablecom praises the taptic engine straps comfort and first party app selection. however the review criticizes the quality of third party apps battery life fitness features and the relatively steep price tag. over time i expect the apple watch to evolve into something much better. as processing power moves up and i expect it to move up dramatically the device should become far more capable and useful to mainstream customers. however even if apples smartwatch offerings get a lot  better its not clear yet that the smartwatch category itself even has much of a long term future. yes there are some things that may be easiermore convenient to do on ones wrist but a smartphone is still a vastly more useful device and its a device that we carry with us virtually all of the time. apple can continue to try. . . for now    apple watch is selling well enough that its raking in multi billions in revenue for the idevice maker. as long as sales of this device remain substantial i would expect the company to continue to invest in the product line. if i were an apple shareholder i would certainly welcome continued attempts here as the category may very well evolve into the next big thing that some are hoping for  especially since the product line is probably profitable for apple but it wouldnt be a material part of my investment thesis. apple is still very much dependent on the iphone for the majority of its revenue and profits and it is ultimately the health or lack thereof of this product line that will drive the real moves in the companys stock price. that being said i do think that the next generation apple watch could be a substantially more interesting device than the first gen model. if apple has packed the upcoming device with many interesting new features and functionality particularly functions that are difficultunpleasant to carry out on a smartphone then perhaps sales could return to growth 00NUMBER00 companies

and the united states federal bureau of investigation fbi has been anything but a secret. it has dominated headlines over the last month plus but after the fbi announced on monday that it had unlocked the iphone  and would be withdrawing its lawsuit against apple it seems as though the feud may finally be over. the question is who really came out on toplets back up a bit first. this all started with the couple syed rizwan farook and his wife tashfeen malik who attacked a civic services center in san bernardino california in december. when the fbi got farooks encrypted iphone agents reached out to apple asking for help gaining access to it. apple refused to help. iphones have long been considered un hackable. in 00NUMBER00 apple introduced new encryption software into its iphones that would make it basically impossible to unlock an encrypted phone or build a backdoor into them. 00NUMBER00 stellar dow jones stocks to buy for 00NUMBER00 in addition to that modern phones are equipped with a feature that will erase all data after 00NUMBER00 failed password attempts. naturally the fbi didnt want to risk losing everything on the phone so they asked apple not to turn off the encryption software but to simply give agents the ability to guess the four digit password as many times as they needed. officials had already reset the password cutting off certain ways for apple to get the information. still apple declined aid and on feb. 00NUMBER00 a federal court ordered the company to help the fbi unlock the phone. the following morning apple said that they would fight the ruling as they feared that once software was created that could get around the phones security features it could fall into the wrong hands. the fbi has since announced that it has successfully hacked farooks iphone but apple could be facing even more problems. as i mentioned the iphone had long been considered un hackable. but now that terrorists and criminals know the fbi has the key theyll adjust their plotting accordingly. and until this point the fbi has shown no public interest in telling aapl how it was able to beat the phones security which leaves the tech company scrambling to uncover the vulnerability. still i think we can come to conclusion that both apple and the fbi have claimed some sort of victory. while the fbi probably should have tried to keep the fight a secret apple stuck to its roots as a libertarian anti establishment company that stands guard for consumers and the public against big government. ceo tim cook kept his street cred although i wouldnt have been against him offering to take the san bernardino phone to a special location to get the information out of it. that said nobody thrashed their phones and techies probably love  apple stock  even more now. plus any new unbreakable encryption will be a major selling point in the next iphone. curious what wall street insider charles payne really thinks  get more behind the scenes insights

could be used to activate different features of the watch or an iphone its connected to. it also shows a person using sign language with the device. antenna   the iphone 00NUMBER00 may incorporate a

in recent memory still drew the worlds attention. though apple by no means debuted anything astounding its largely derivative new iphone se and ipad pro are still likely to carry some key business implications   particularly for its all important smartphone segment. more specifically the iphone se is likely to cut into apples margins to some degree in the near term. however of far greater import the devices benefits should far outweigh its costs over the long term. source appleiphone se margin impact    though its screen was the most readily observable thing apple shrunk on the new iphone se it was hardly the only thing that apple made smaller. apple also lowered the upfront price to 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 for the 00NUMBER00 gb version. effectively powered by the same innards  as the firms flagship 00NUMBER00 the iphone se will cost roughly 00NUMBER00 than its larger smartphone brethren when it officially goes on sale. in doing so apple has shifted its pricing strategy away from using older iphone models as the gateway devices into its ecosystem to offering cheaper editions of its most current technology which has some camps concerned over the phones overall profitability. estimates currently peg the bill of materials for the iphone 00NUMBER00 to be 00NUMBER00 though the iphone se likely costs slight less to produce. for arguments sake lets assume parts and assembly for an iphone se cost an admittedly imprecise but practical 00NUMBER00 on its smaller less pixel laden display and its older case design. though inexact this plausible working estimate implies a per device gross margin of 00NUMBER00 for the iphone se which compares unfavorably to the rest of the iphone lineup. iphone seiphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gb 00NUMBER00 of 00NUMBER00 gross 00NUMBER00 ihs  apple  authors estimateviewed this way the iphone se seems like a relatively unpalatable option for apple and its shareholders. crucially though that chart only tells half the story. not 00NUMBER00 all over   the prospect of tighter margins for apple has some more tenured investors and observers understandably spooked. those of us who have followed the company for long enough remember its 00NUMBER00 off in which margin contraction issues also played a pivotal role. aapl  data by ychartsthankfully a similar scenario is unlikely to unfold in the coming weeks for several reasons. for starters apples 00NUMBER00 iphone unit sales were roughly 00NUMBER00 greater than its 00NUMBER00 sales. apple disclosed that it sold 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 inch iphones 00NUMBER00 and its fair to expect it to sell even more ses than that in 00NUMBER00 due to their competitive prices and improved hardware. however the truly massive scale of apples iphone business today should help insulate the firm from any kind of material impact. whats more the timing of the iphone se launch should also prove a mitigating factor in preventing a margin meltdown similar to 00NUMBER00 from occurring. though its early in the year were likely only six months away from the expected debut of apples iphone 00NUMBER00 which should help drive renewed interest in apples larger more profitable models. taking a longer term view the iphone se is likely to prove a valuable tool in pulling new consumers into apples ecosystem. as vp of product marketing greg joskwiak mentioned at the se launch event the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone has proven particularly popular in key emerging markets like china. viewed through this lens the iphone se appears most likely to become the entry level iphone in coming years which should help the firm compete with android phones in emerging markets. and given the strength of apples ecosystem in retaining customers this new carrot will likely serve apple well in years to come. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the

fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  on thursday apple  began selling the iphone se its first new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00. the new model is very similar to the iphone 00NUMBER00 terms of features and performance except that it is missing apples new 00NUMBER00 touch technology. yet it is much cheaper with a starting unsubsidized price of 00NUMBER00 compared to 00NUMBER00 for the iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone se hit the market on thursday. image source apple. the iphone se is the cheapest iphone that apple has ever launched. its also the first time the company has launched a new lower cost model in between flagship iphone launches. as a result it wont be straightforward to determine whether the iphone se is a success or not. growing in the mid range market    ever since apple launched the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in late 00NUMBER00 its 00NUMBER00 inch iphones have been positioned at the bottom of its product lineup targeting the mid range market. at the iphone se launch event apple noted that it sold 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 inch iphones during 00NUMBER00. apple achieved that performance even though its 00NUMBER00 inch model the iphone 00NUMBER00 was already 00NUMBER00 months old at the beginning of 00NUMBER00. the company hopes that launching an affordable 00NUMBER00 inch phone with up to date specs will spark upgrades among iphone fans who prefer the smaller models while also growing apples market share among price sensitive smartphone buyers. dont expect lines or price premiums    clearly apple ought to be able to sell more than 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 inch phones this year with a brand new offering in the market. unfortunately it doesnt usually report sales by individual model so we arent likely to find out directly how the iphone se is doing relative to that milestone. also many of the usual metrics that pundits use to judge iphone sales dont make much sense for the iphone se. for example some news outlets reported on the lack of lines for the iphone se launch. however the vast majority of the market has moved to larger devices. apple may have sold 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 inch iphones last year but that also means it sold about 00NUMBER00 million larger iphones furthermore the technology in the iphone se isnt new. people who want to get the latest features as soon as they are available i. e. those who would normally line up on the first day probably bought the iphone 00NUMBER00. apples larger iphones outsold the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 a mile in 00NUMBER00. image source apple. meanwhile cnbc reported  that scalpers in china didnt expect to be able to sell the iphone se at a premium whereas other iphones have sold for about 00NUMBER00 above list price initially. this isnt surprising or alarming either. most people in china prefer larger screen phones. the main point the iphone se has going for it in china is that it is more affordable. clearly price sensitive consumers wouldnt pay 00NUMBER00 extra to get the iphone se a few weeks early. a small pool of early adopters    based on the iphone ses target markets its not likely to see a flood of early sales. but theres certainly a contingent of iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 users who have been waiting for a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone to upgrade. to get a sense of how big this demand pool is investors can monitor the wait times on apples online store. as of thursday evening within the u. s. most iphone se versions were available to ship in 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 days or 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 days. many u. s. apple store locations had good stock of the iphone se but a significant minority of stores were completely sold out. given that the iphone se should be fairly easy to build production constraints shouldnt be a major factor limiting supply. however apple may have placed very conservative component orders  initially. if it takes more than a couple of weeks for lead times to shrink to 00NUMBER00 hours it would suggest that demand is quite robust. demand should remain steady    due to its low price the iphone se will appeal to price sensitive consumers who are more likely to buy a new phone when their old one stops working rather than on a set one year or two year upgrade cycle. this means that iphone se sales might not peak quickly and decline after a few months as has been typical for other iphone models. well get some sense of how the iphone se is doing in a few weeks when apple provides its guidance for the third fiscal quarter. apple is likely to post a double digit iphone sales decline in the second fiscal quarter. if it can get back to the flat line or close in 00NUMBER00 it would be largely thanks to the iphone se. iphone se sales may also hold up well during the fourth fiscal quarter because apple isnt likely to put out a 00NUMBER00 inch model in september. by contrast sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will probably slow even further over the summer as would be buyers hold out for the iphone 00NUMBER00. if apple can get back to iphone sales growth in 00NUMBER00 it would also suggest that the iphone se was performing well. of course it would be much easier to gauge the iphone ses success if tim cook provides more details of how it is selling during apples upcoming earnings calls. whether he will oblige remains to be seen. a secret billion dollar

inc. aapl    has certainly caught sexier wall street commentary but an analyst lifted his price target on  apple stock   monday as the market comes to realize that it doesnt give an important business segment enough credit. credit suisses kulbinder garcha who raised his price target 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 and added aapl to the firms u. s. focus list. the analyst already has an outperform rating buy essentially on apple stock. his new price target means the apple stock price has an implied upside of 00NUMBER00 in the next 00NUMBER00 months or so. thats on the high side of estimates but even the average target price of 00NUMBER00 an implied upside of 00NUMBER00. taken as a whole the street consensus on aapl is that its a buy. now comes the important part. credit suisse believes that the market is underestimating the gross profit contribution from apples services division and   underappreciates its growth potential and the annuity type business it drives in terms of retention and replacement across the business. bullishness on the services business which includes everything from itunes to apple pay is fashionable these days because aapl disclosed revenue figures for the first time just a few months ago. in fiscal 00NUMBER00 grew 00NUMBER00 to nearly 00NUMBER00 billion. 00NUMBER00 stellar dow jones stocks to buy for 00NUMBER00 a great earner for apple because it isnt tied to the ups and downs of quarterly gadget sales. rather it compounds as people buy more apple devices. customers use the icloud apple music whatever long after apple makes the initial sale. with an install base of a billion active users you can see how services offer a large material contribution to earnings. heres a breakdown of what the services business can do  from credit suissefirst we note an installed base of over 00NUMBER00 billion active devices and almost 00NUMBER00 million unique users that are highly affluent and transacting accounting for 00NUMBER00 of mobile commerce spending 00NUMBER00 times more than android users. second we see a services spend per user accelerating to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 years from 00NUMBER00 as uptake of service offerings including scale from apple pay apple music and icloud takes hold and download revenues stabilize. third we see new service opportunities in the tvvideo market. apple made figures from services available to reassure investors who are worried about flagging iphone sales and it was a good move. no nothing can replace the iphone it accounted for more than two thirds of sales in the most recent quarter but it helps dispel the view that aapl is a one trick pony. credit suisses report to clients is just another step in the process of the market coming to terms with the fact that it has overly discounted aapl and by a lot. sentiment on apple stock is starting to rebound after a long period of decline. indeed the apple stock price is up about 00NUMBER00 for the year to date. that beats the sp 00NUMBER00 almost 00NUMBER00 percentage points. apple stock is still a buy at current levels on valuation alone but it may not be for too much longer. reassessments of the non iphone segments and mounting excitement for the autumn launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 have shares catching up to a fair valuation in a hurry. the bottom line buy aapl stock before its too late. as of this writing dan burrows did not hold a

of apples 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro shows a device with little wiggle room inside   appleinsider notes. the tech company had to move around many of the components in the new ipad pro to make it all fit inside 00NUMBER00 inch shell. this resulted in the device being very compact on the inside. the teardown claims that this makes it harder to repair. the lcd and front panel glassed are fused together.

released a new research note via macrumors in which he puts out some predictions around the iphone 00NUMBER00. first of all he claims that the iphone 00NUMBER00 series will feature a similar form factor as iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus suggesting that the idevice maker wont make significant changes to the appearance and usability of the device. next he claims that the most significant change to the new device will be the inclusion of dual cameras though this feature as he reported previously will be exclusive to the larger 00NUMBER00 inch. kuo warns though that because apples competition will beat the idevice maker to the introduction of dual cameras in their respective flagships the feature may not have the wow factor when it is introduced. all told the well connected analyst thinks that for 00NUMBER00 shipments will fall within 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million units with sales likely falling below the 00NUMBER00 million unit mark. he also believes that iphone 00NUMBER00 series sales will trail those for the already disappointing iphone 00NUMBER00 plus series. if true thats bad news for apple    the relative failure of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the marketplace was largely believed to be due to the fact that although apple introduced significant internalperformance enhancements it didnt do much to make the phones look  better. the industrial design remained largely the same and the display panels remained unchanged. many investors and industry observers have expected andor hoped that apple would bring more substantial changes with the iphone 00NUMBER00 series devices in order to spur upgrades. however if the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is largely similar to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus but with a headline feature thats exclusive to the iphone 00NUMBER00 then that doesnt bode well for the idevice makers business prospects and ultimately stock price over the next year. the problem with once per year flagship launches    i think that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus exposed a fundamental flaw in apples product release strategy. if the companys annual product release is a big hit then it can easily reap the rewards of that product for the entire fiscal year. however if its next big thing turns out to be a dud as in the case of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus shareholders are forced to spend at least a year in proverbial purgatory waiting for the next product cycle to potentially drive gains. one could of course point to the fact that apple launched the iphone se to try to help things along a bit and the product is quite interesting but its not going to sell in the kinds of volumes to ultimately make up for a lackluster pair of flagship devices. wait for additional iphone 00NUMBER00 specs to hit    although kuo is well respected i think its important for investors to wait for additional information about the specifications of the iphone 00NUMBER00 to come out. as i noted in a prior article there are a number of avenues of improvement  that apple can pursue that in aggregate could make for a substantially better phone that could help fuel upgrades and ultimately demand. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode

oled based displays with the iphone 00NUMBER00 phones that are set to launch this year kgi securities ming chi kuo says that the first oled iphone will arrive in 00NUMBER00 timeframe   complete with an all new industrial design. however just because apple wont be moving to an oled display this year doesnt mean that the idevice maker wont bring a significant improvement in display performance to its upcoming flagships. after seeing a review  of the recently released lg 00NUMBER00 a flagship packing an lcd  its clear what sorts of advancements we will see with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus display. big contrast ratio boost brightness jump    according to apple the display on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus features a typical contrast ratio of 00NUMBER00 and a typical max brightness of 00NUMBER00 nits. at the time that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launched 00NUMBER00 plus carries over the same display from the 00NUMBER00 plus this was quite respectable for a high end lcd. these days though its pretty dated. the lg 00NUMBER00 according to a review from phone arena  delivers some very seriously impressive performance numbers. measured contrast ratio comes in at a very solid 00NUMBER00 a significant boost from what the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus display comes in at. maximum brightness in nits measures in at 00NUMBER00 nits which is quite impressive. given what lg was able to achieve here i have little doubt that apple which tends to deliver very impressive displays with its new number iphones will be able to meet or exceed the display specifications seen with the lg 00NUMBER00 at least with its higher end iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. a display resolution jump too    the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus feature displays with 00NUMBER00. given that lg was able to pack a quad 00NUMBER00 lcd with excellent contrast and very high brightness into a phone with just a 00NUMBER00 mah battery the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has a 00NUMBER00 mah battery iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will likely be larger i have little doubt that apple will increase the resolution on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus display to 00NUMBER00 the native rendering resolution on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and 00NUMBER00. this should be a solid update ahead of the oled iphone    although i must admit to be extremely excited for the rumored follow on to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which is expected to come with a curved oled display the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus should be a solid upgrade over the current iphones. with a new much better lcd thinner body better internals and probably a much better camera subsystem the iphone 00NUMBER00 phones should be a nice upgrade for users with 00NUMBER00 class iphones or older. the new oled packing iphone in 00NUMBER00 be a big enough advance to grab iphone 00NUMBER00 owners and holdouts with older generation iphones. the innovation from apple will accelerate    over time i believe that apple will bring innovations to its new phones whether it be in displays or elsewhere at an extremely rapid clip far faster than it has in the past. this level of innovation will be necessary in order to combat the effects of good enough iphones. make no mistake convincing people to upgrade from phones like the iphone 00NUMBER00 series and beyond is going to become increasingly tough. apples marketing and engineering teams have significant challenges ahead of them in the coming years and it will be interesting to see if apple can succeed where its competition has failed. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are

iphone apple has accumulated 00NUMBER00 billion worth of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities. to put that in perspective the worlds largest hedge fund bridgewater associates has a mere 00NUMBER00 billion worth of assets under management. this adds complexity to apple. in addition to developing and improving products expanding market share in existing markets and tapping into new markets the california based company must also manage what may very well be the largest accumulation of retained profits in the world. it does so principally by investing in corporate and government securities as you can see in the chart below. a majority of apples investable assets are allocated to corporate securities which accounted for 00NUMBER00 of its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter. u. s. government securities make up the second largest category at 00NUMBER00 split between treasury and so called agency securities that is mortgage backed securities insured by fannie mae andor freddy mac. and cash and a variety of other investments lay claim to the rest. while the large amount of corporate securities makes it seem like apple takes on substantial credit risk with its investment portfolio the company is clear in its regulatory filings that its selective when it comes to making investments. as it notes in its 00NUMBER00 q   emphasis addedthe company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the italicized portion is reminiscent in particular of warren buffetts maxim about the two most important rules of investingrule no 00NUMBER00 never lose money. rule no. 00NUMBER00 never forget rule no. 00NUMBER00. the iphone se apples latest phone designed especially for sale in

for instance there was only a 00NUMBER00 billion difference between the adjusted cost of apples positions and their fair market value. that may seem like a lot in absolute terms we are after all talking about billions  of dollars but it amounts to a mere 00NUMBER00 change in the portfolios value. this is good news for shareholders. the size of apples cash and investment portfolio insulates it from negative economic shocks which could bring less prepared companies down. this is particularly important given the ongoing economic issues in china apples second largest market after the united states. its also good news because it means that apples massive capital hoard is being carefully preserved for future distribution to shareholders. this leaves it substantial room to grow its dividend and buttress its already considerable share buyback program in the quarters and years ahead. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the article by this measure apple is the worlds largest hedge fund  originally appeared on foolcom.

apple    aapl    has released the first beta of os x 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 capitan to developers   reports macrumors. developers looking to get their hands on this new beta can download it from the companys developer center. being that the beta has just been released its still unknown what kind of changes have been made to the operating system with this update. this new beta has been released two weeks after the final version of os 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 was released to the general public. bug   apple has fixed a bug that allowed access to the device without a passcode or touch id   bgr notes. the issue fixed by the tech company made it so that a person could gain access to the photos and contacts without entering the security requirements on the lock screen. the problem was present in ios 00NUMBER00 and was fixed via a server side update which means users dont have to take any action for the fix to be applied to their device. apps   code suggests that apple will let users hide default apps on ios devices   reports appleinsider. the code was discovered in itunes metadata and it includes the ability to hide default apps. however this feature is currently set to false but could be changed to true in later ios updates. this change would satisfy many iphone and ipad users that complain about not being able to hide the default apps on their devices. the post wednesday apple rumors apple releases first os 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 beta  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  iphone se. image source apple. apple  s new iphone se went on sale last week but it seems that the launch may have been somewhat lackluster according to kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo. among other data points kuo cited localytics data that put iphone se penetration at a meager 00NUMBER00. the analyst also questioned demand in china. meanwhile there was another notable product unveiling that happened last thursday as well tesla  s model 00NUMBER00. the electric automaker started taking in store reservations that same morning which could have diverted some potential foot traffic from apple retail stores. tens of thousands of people showed up at tesla stores to put 00NUMBER00 on a car theyd never seen before. nonetheless theres some more evidence that suggests that apples iphone se was the right strategic move. survey says    market researcher kantar worldpanel comtech  has released some new estimates that suggest the majority of u. s. iphone users are still using 00NUMBER00 inch iphones. 00NUMBER00 of iphone users are still using an iphone 00NUMBER00 or older and these models are getting old. kantar estimates that the average life cycle of these devices is 00NUMBER00 months. image source apple. thats longer than the typical two year upgrade cycle that characterizes the market. in fact the u. s. market has actually been seeing upgrade cycles get shorter in recent years as the major carriers shift to leasing installment and early upgrade programs. the average life cycle for the overall market is 00NUMBER00 according to kantar. the iphone se is the perfect device for these customers to jump to as an affordable upgrade that brings the latest and greatest  tech specs inside the same chassis. kantars figures also suggest that 00NUMBER00 of these 00NUMBER00 inch iphone users intend to upgrade within the next year and 00NUMBER00 of them will stay within apples ecosystem. moving on down    the iphone se is positioned to appeal precisely to these customers the segment of users that simply prefer a smaller handset. kuos perspective on the chinese market is somewhat skewed since larger phones are extremely popular in the middle kingdom. remember that its precisely this popularity that pushed apple to launch the larger 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch iphones in the first place. the flip side is that the iphone se starting at 00NUMBER00 may put some downward pressure on average selling prices. but the strong performance of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have helped push asps to record levels nearly 00NUMBER00 last quarter so apple can afford to give a little back. besides most of those iphone se buyers should probably upgrade from the base 00NUMBER00 gb model  anyway and quadruple storage capacity for the extra 00NUMBER00. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

lowest end package with the iphone se. from a product strategy standpoint its incredibly smart since it provides a strong product for the large segment of the market that still prefers smaller phones. from a pricing strategy standpoint the iphone se also serves as evidence that apple is evolving as the global smartphone market matures. the way its always been    for many years apple has implemented a consistent strategy of cascading iphone models down to successively lower price points thereby extending the overall life cycle of each new model and streamlining development resources. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was the first major departure from this strategy but the 00NUMBER00 didnt fare well because it didnt convey a strong value proposition. the iphone se is another attempt and a more promising one at that. but the introduction of the iphone se raises some important questions about the iphone portfolio. whats happening to the development cycle will the iphone se get a price reduction next yearlets say that apple has decided to segment its iphone offerings between smaller and more affordable devices and larger and more expensive devices. apple should keep strong current products to capture both market segments instead of relegating older devices to lower price points. this could be whats happening as we speak. the way it might be now    if thats the case then we might even expect apple to discontinue the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in 00NUMBER00 a relatively shorter two year life cycle compared to the historical three year life cycle instead of dropping it to a lower price as we would have previously expected. then the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 would drop to the mid range price point and the new 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus would come in as the new high end flagships. since the iphone se was just introduced i wouldnt expect any changes at the low end of the portfolio until next year. but at that point would apple really consider reducing the iphone se to an even lower price point of perhaps 00NUMBER00 that seems unlikely even if it could potentially spur unit growth since it would hurt average selling prices margins and risk diluting the brand. instead what if apple introduced an entirely 00NUMBER00 inch iphone for 00NUMBER00 while discontinuing the iphone se that would be a remarkably short life cycle for the se but remember that the device shouldnt have required too much development work since it uses the same chassis and overall design as 00NUMBER00. the se is just a 00NUMBER00 in a 00NUMBER00 body. another possibility is that since the iphone 00NUMBER00 is expected to feature a new design maybe apple will make a smaller version of this new design and position it at the low end where the se currently sits. thats what i think apple will do. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

the more interesting competitors in the smartphone market and by extension to apple  is china based huawei. the company which had previously been known mostly for its telecom equipment has aggressively pushed into the market for smartphones and has become one of the volume leaders in said market. huawei executives talk quite a bit about how they intend to grow to be the largest vendor of smartphone shipments presumably by units. huawei is also bullish on its ability to become a leading vendor of premium read high average selling price smartphones a segment that apple clearly dominates. following the publication of huaweis annual report we can now get a glimpse into how huawei is doing in the smartphone market. big unit growth but average selling prices still well below apples    in 00NUMBER00 huawei reported a nearly 00NUMBER00 revenue surge in its consumer business which is likely composed substantially of sales of smartphones and other smart devices hitting approximately 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue on sales of over 00NUMBER00 smartphones. if we naively divide 00NUMBER00 billion by 00NUMBER00 million we get an implied average selling price of 00NUMBER00 per phone. assuming that not all  of the revenue came from phones the implied average selling price for huaweis smartphones could be higher but probably not substantially so. in contrast apples iphone average selling prices on substantially greater units tend to be much higher often well above 00NUMBER00. lower operating margins    although huaweis gross profit margins are actually quite 00NUMBER00 in the last year its operating margins came in 00NUMBER00 of revenue in 00NUMBER00. in contrast apples operating income during its fiscal 00NUMBER00 came in at 00NUMBER00 billion or a 00NUMBER00 of revenue. this high operating margin is due to the fact that apples total revenue base is absolutely enormous allowing it to drive significant operating leverage. on top of that apples research and development spend only came in at around 00NUMBER00 a large figure in absolute terms but relative to revenue it is quite small. that said apples operating margins are almost certain to contract this year as revenue declines and research and development spend move upward but i expect them to be substantially above huaweis. despite this advantage apple needs to be careful    despite being solidly ahead of huawei i do think that huawei does represent a significant threat to apple if left unchecked. the chinese smartphone maker introduced a pair of new phones on april 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus that in a number of ways pull ahead of apples current albeit roughly six month old flagships. theyre thinner likely feature better cameras and appear to have superior displays. these are all critical components to the smartphone experience and ones in which apple had historically led to see the idevice maker allow itself to fall behind like this is a little disconcerting. apple is expected to launch next generation iphone flagships  the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in september which should allow apple to regain leadership in a number of critical areas. apple may also have a few innovative tricks up its sleeve. as ive said before and will say again apple needs to ensure that at virtually all times it has flagship devices out there that are unequivocally leadership products particularly as the smartphone market slows and it becomes a battle to maintaingain market share. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is

increasing its dividend annually but apple also specifically promised during the companys first fiscal quarter earnings call that it would update its capital return program alongside its second quarter earnings report which is scheduled for monday april 00NUMBER00. a dividend increase therefore is all but certain. the question is what will apples new dividend amount toa 00NUMBER00 dividend hike    the tech giants recent dividend increases suggest the tech giant is likely to boost its dividend by about 00NUMBER00 this year. since apple reinitiated a dividend in 00NUMBER00 the companys dividend has increased by an average of 00NUMBER00 each year. further the companys recent quarterly dividend increase which was announced just over a year ago was 00NUMBER00. it makes sense therefore that the company would continue to increase its dividend at a similar rate. this years increase will be particularly interesting because it comes at a time when the company guided for a rare year over year decline in quarterly revenue. when apple reported first quarter results it guided for 00NUMBER00 revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion well below the companys 00NUMBER00 in revenue in the year ago quarter. some investors might be concerned that apple will approach its dividend increase more conservatively amid the companys contracting revenue. still despite the companys challenges in growing its top line this year a 00NUMBER00 plus dividend increase is still likely the companys current dividend is conservative enough that even amid a pullback in apples top line management will likely stick with a consistent increase in order to give its income seeking shareholders some predictability. to show just how easy it is for the company to increase its dividend heres some context. apple pays out just 00NUMBER00 of its annual earnings in dividends leaving significant room for further dividend increases even if earnings suffer. similarly of the companys 00NUMBER00 billion in free cash flow during the trailing 00NUMBER00 months apple paid out just 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends. a 00NUMBER00 dividend increase this year therefore is likely even if the company struggles to grow revenue. this increase would amount to a quarterly dividend of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 annually. this would be up from 00NUMBER00 every quarter or 00NUMBER00 annually. with apples stock price of about 00NUMBER00 at the time of this writing this higher dividend would give the company a dividend yield of about 00NUMBER00 up from a dividend yield of approximately 00NUMBER00 with todays dividend. beyond apples dividend   of course theres more to apples capital return program than its dividend. the company also uses its excess capital to repurchase its own shares. indeed the companys share repurchase portion of its return program is far more significant. when apple updated its capital return program last april the companys board authorized a 00NUMBER00 boost to its overall capital return program to 00NUMBER00 billion. the amount authorized for share repurchases specifically increased from 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. given the conservative price of apple shares going into the companys second quarter earnings report its likely share repurchases will continue to see a higher cash allocation than dividends when the company announces an update to its capital return program on april 00NUMBER00. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

that will stick out is the increasing importance of china to the iphone makers top and bottom lines. as i illustrate in the three charts below sales growth in region which includes hong kong and taiwan is handily outpacing apples other geographic divisions and has transformed the east asian country into the tech giants second largest market. 00NUMBER00. sales growth in china is outpacing other regions    chinas contribution to apples top line was on display in its latest quarterly results. for the three months ended 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 apples sales in china increased by 00NUMBER00 over the year ago period. thats less than the 00NUMBER00 growth rate recorded in the region for all of fiscal 00NUMBER00 but its still more than the tech companys other reporting segments americas europe japan and rest of asia pacific. data source apple. sales in the americas and japan did particularly poorly throughout apples first quarter. they declined by 00NUMBER00 in the americas which is dominated by the united states and by 00NUMBER00 japan. in fact were it not for chinas contribution apples overall net sales would have fallen last quarter by approximately 00NUMBER00 billion. 00NUMBER00. china is now apples second most important market    thanks to this rapid growth china eclipsed europe last year as apples second biggest market. this isnt because sales in europe contracted in 00NUMBER00. just the opposite was in fact the case. sales grew on the continent by 00NUMBER00 last year compared 00NUMBER00. data source apple. but even though europes 00NUMBER00 increase is nothing to shake a stick at it paled in comparison to the performance in china. thanks to the addition of china mobile in the second quarter 00NUMBER00 as well as the rollout of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus apples sales in the worlds most populated country soared by 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00. as you can see in the chart above the relative growth rates in china and europe in 00NUMBER00 allowed the former to surpass the latter when it comes to the contribution to apples top line. 00NUMBER00. chinas bottom line contribution    after the regions incredible success in 00NUMBER00 greater china now accounts for more than a quarter of apples net operating income. that outpaces europes contribution by seven percentage points and trails only the americas from which apple 00NUMBER00 of its earnings. data source apple. chinas importance to apples bottom line is bound to grow. apples market share in the country is meaningfully less than its share in the united states. additionally with the release of the iphone se which is designed specifically  to entice buyers in emerging markets theres every reason to believe that the east asian region could become apples biggest sales source at some point in the next few years. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts

inc.  the iphone se. image source apple. apple  s long anticipated 00NUMBER00 inch iphone refresh dubbed the iphone se is now available for purchase in many countries and by the end of may should be out in 00NUMBER00 countries according to the idevice maker. the phone is targeted at two main audiences. the first is the set of smartphone buyersiphone owners who simply dont want larger phones but do want excellent performance and features in a compact package. the second is the set of folks who want iphones but cant afford or simply dont want to pay for higher priced larger screen iphones. the iphone se brings virtually all of the internal horsepower of the iphone 00NUMBER00 to a 00NUMBER00 inch package which should satisfy the first set of buyers. the device also starts at 00NUMBER00 a contract with the price moving up to 00NUMBER00 for the model with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage. its definitely budget as far as iphones go but is it a bargain lets take a closer look. fantastic performance    the iphone se packs an 00NUMBER00 processor apples fastest smartphone chip and two gigabytes of zippy 00NUMBER00 memory. in performance tests it performs identically to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus  arguably the fastest smartphones on the market today particularly in cpu performance. in real world usage the se doesnt disappoint. even the most demanding of 00NUMBER00 mobile games run extremely smoothly no doubt as a result of the uber fast 00NUMBER00 chip driving a relatively low resolution 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 display. performance per pixel is off the charts as far as smartphones go. the zippy cpu performance translates into an excellent web surfing experience something that i do quite frequently with my smartphones. solid rear camera no opinion on the selfie cam    the rear shooter is identical to the one found on the 00NUMBER00. although the 00NUMBER00 camera has been outclassed by a few android flagships the camera is still one of the best in the mobile industry. in a 00NUMBER00 plus flagship not being the absolute best is worth criticizing but in a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 phone having a camera this solid is awesome. as far as the front facing camera or the selfie cam goes i dont take selfies and very rarely do video calls so i have no opinion on it. that said if this were a high priced flagship the relatively low 00NUMBER00 megapixel selfie cam would probably be a problem but in a budget iphone that gives the user so much elsewhere i think this can be forgiven. and after all apple has to make sure that there are still reasons to buy up to the higher priced flagships. the display is ancient but passable    the display is the same exact panel  that first made its debut with the iphone 00NUMBER00 in late 00NUMBER00 that its north of three years old now. its not a bad  display by any means it was stunning for a mobile device back in 00NUMBER00 and i am sure that apple is using it because its very cheap to produce at this point but its noticeably less pleasing to the eye than the panels found on the iphone 00NUMBER00 of devices. compared to other mid range android smartphones in the same price class as the iphone say the nexus 00NUMBER00 the display on the se is outdated. sadly the same can probably be truthfully said for the displays on flagship iphones apple needs to step up its iphone display game across the board. is 00NUMBER00 inches too small    in todays world large phones are all the rage with virtually all major handset manufacturers save for apple seemingly abandoning the notion of a high performance small smartphone. personally i quite like the ability to comfortably operate the device with just one hand without having to resort to the crutches like reachability that apple implemented in the iphone 00NUMBER00 series and beyond. web surfing is still a good experience though arguably better on a larger device. ditto for watching tv shows and video clips. the iphone se could be good enough to be my main smartphone until the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus arrive. after using the device for a couple more weeks ill make my final decision as to whether i want to sell off my iphone 00NUMBER00 and continue to use the se until the new flagships sail on in. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

se. source apple. apple  s financial performance is heavily tied to the success of its core iphone device. last fiscal year two thirds of apples top line was due to iphone sales. in the recently reported first fiscal quarter investors reacted harshly when apple reported flat year on year iphone sales and ceo tim cook admitted the company expects iphone unit sales to decrease next quarter. since that report apple introduced its newest addition to the iphone family the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se with a starting price 00NUMBER00. whether the iphone se will become a success remains up for debate. on the bear side is kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo who questioned earlier reports that apple received 00NUMBER00 pre orders for the new iphone in the important market of china. kuo went on to describe demand of the new unit to be significantly lower than other models. additionally piper jaffray found early on that 00NUMBER00 of 00NUMBER00 apple stores in new york city los angeles dallas and minneapolis had the device in stock leading the company to predict lower than expected demand. a recent report from macrumors is decidedly more bullish noting that apple has lengthened its delivery date to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 in the u. s. major carriers are reporting similar shipping increases and apple stores in large markets of nyc la san francisco philadelphia and washington d. c. are selling out of their iphone se inventory. 00NUMBER00 million chinese pre orders    many of these reports are based on anecdotes. not having the device in stock could be indicative of a tremendous pent up demand but it could equally be due to supply constraints. on the other hand apples having the iphone se in stock doesnt necessarily mean the phone isnt popular but rather the company properly gauged demand and adjusted supply accordingly. perhaps the key takeaway is cnbcs report that apple had 00NUMBER00 iphone se pre orders in china. most likely these iphone se pre orders will show up in apples second quarter earnings. apple doesnt report iphone sales on a geographic basis but 00NUMBER00 million of apples lowest cost iphone se would represent 00NUMBER00 of the total revenue apple grossed in china in last years corresponding quarter. this figure is impressive but not exactly a thesis altering event. success or not its unlikely to stop apple from shipping fewer iphone units this quarter    chinese technology website digitimes looks into apples supply chain for insight. according to an unnamed source the iphone se shipment target during the quarter is 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million units. unfortunately for apple investors digitimes reports that these shipments will not offset falling sales of higher cost iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models. if correct look for apple to report both lower shipment totals and lower average selling prices. together these are headwinds to revenue growth. its highly likely that ceo tim cook was well aware second quarter results would include shipments of the iphone se. still cook admitted the company would probably report a year on year iphone sales decrease. cook partly blamed the resolution of supply constraints in last years corresponding quarter and current macroeconomic headwinds for the projected year on year decrease. even if the iphone se is a success its unlikely to offset slower current gen iphone sales. look for apple to provide more commentary on its iphone se sales figures during its april 00NUMBER00 conference call. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest

family which essentially jams an iphone 00NUMBER00 hybrid into the body of an iphone 00NUMBER00 is doing fairly well in the marketplace. analyst amit daryanani with rbc capital via barrons   observes that the iphone se currently has 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 weeks lead time in apple online store. in the united states the analyst notes the lead times appear to be in the range of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 weeks while in china a region that daryanani thinks apple prioritized initial iphone se stock in the lead times are two weeks. the conclusion that the analyst gleaned from this the iphone se is selling well or as he points out at least demand is outstripping supply. on track for 00NUMBER00 million units shipped    the analyst believes that apple is on track to ship around 00NUMBER00 units of the iphone se this year a figure that digitimes says apples supply chain vendors are expecting for the year. per the analyst 00NUMBER00 million unit shipments should mean 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue and a 00NUMBER00 cent per share boost relative to consensus estimates in profit. not bad for a product thats largely a mish mash of previous generation iphoneskeep an ear out on the coming earnings call    the purpose of the iphone se is at least from a financial standpoint to try to stimulate demand for iphone ahead of the launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus flagships in september. the se can serve to accomplish this by offering a great value at relatively low price points as well as by catering to the apparently non trivial demand for 00NUMBER00 inch smartphones with up to date internals. the financial impact that sales of the se will have on apples results wont show up in the results that the idevice maker will report on april 00NUMBER00 it should be felt in the following quarter for which apple will give guidance. what if the iphone se is a hit a dud    if the iphone se really does turn out to be a hit then i would expect apple like any well run technology company to continue to iterate and build on the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone form factor in coming years. the pace of that iteration will probably be dependent on a number of factors. the questions that i see apple management asking themselves when planning the future of the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone are the followinghow good are the sales numbers of the iphone se the better the sales of the device the more quickly apple is likely to be bothered to put out enhanced versions. is the iphone se cannibalizing larger screen iphone sales to a significant degree the cannibalization is obviously there to some extent but is it enough to offset the potential volume upside from a competitive lower cost 00NUMBER00 inch product the more incremental in nature the iphone se sales are the more likely apple is to iterate the line. if the se turns out to be a total dud though something that i view as unlikely given that this product is likely to make apple a substantial amount of money for relatively little incremental work it would likely be the end of the 00NUMBER00 inch class iphone. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when

hamilton analyst brian white well known for his sky high price targets on apple  stock published a research report detailing his findings from meetings with members of apples supply chain via macrumors. the analyst said that apple plans to begin mass production of its next generation iphones in july. per one of his supply chain contacts apple will see iphone sales grow year over year during the second half of 00NUMBER00 after a rough start to 00NUMBER00. white also confirmed kgi securities earlier report that only apples larger iphone 00NUMBER00 plus would feature a dual lens camera with the iphone 00NUMBER00 coming equipped with a single lens. arguably more interesting though was the information that white gave about apples next generation apple watch. say hello to apple watch 00NUMBER00 indicates that his field work suggests that the next generation apple watch wont launch alongside the new iphones in the fall. instead the new devices could come at apples world wide developers conference which is generally hosted in june. white doesnt give too many details about the device but he does say that it could be anywhere from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 thinner than the current generation model. given that the original apple watch is quite bulky a slimmed down design would be most welcome. why does this matter to investors    when apple dropped the price of its entry level apple watch at its let us loop you in event it was clear that the company wanted to stimulate demand for the devices. if apple watch sales were going gangbusters then it probably wouldnt have made sense to lower prices until the next generation models arrived. now apple may have by far the most successful  smartwatch industrywide by a large margin too but in my view the category is still in its infancy and the features and functionality required to drive significant mainstream adoption just arent there in the first gen product. there were also many complaints on the web about the thicknessform factor of the device. for a product thats virtually a fashion item thats hardly ideal. the second generation apple watch has the potential to shake things up though. with a substantial boost in processing power app developers should have a lot more freedom to build more interesting and exciting stand alone applications. at any rate the more capable the apple watch becomes the more likely it is that apple will be able to grow unit shipments and ultimately revenue. though itll be a while before apple watch brings in the kind of revenue that something like the ipad is able to the more diverse the companys revenue base is the less risky it is meaning a potentially higher price to earnings multiple. one more thing. . . an apple watch in june would also serve to keep the buzz around apple alive in the months leading up to the big iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch. new apple watches could also help apple boost its revenues a bit in the final quarter of its fiscal 00NUMBER00 in

nasdaq inc.  consistently one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at stock options channel is apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the july expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the july expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost   for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.

that the new apple watch wont be a full update to the line   reports appleinsider. this report comes from kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo and claims that the new watch will be the equivalent of an s update for iphones. this would mean that the components inside the device would be upgraded but that it will continue to look the same as the previous model. he believes that the watch 00NUMBER00

particularly since it introduced the imac. the imac ipod iphone and ipad all turned out to be important and in some cases revolutionary product categories. further each product category subsequently contributed significantly to the companys bottom line in the years following their introductions. but what about apples 00NUMBER00 launched apple watchone well known apple analyst kgi securities ming chi kuo is predicting via macrumors   the product categorys underwhelming start in 00NUMBER00 continue into 00NUMBER00. indeed hes expecting apple watch sales to decline this year. heres kuos reasoning. how apple watch sales could decline   apple watch shipments will decline more than 00NUMBER00 percent year over year in comparison to 00NUMBER00 according to a new research note issued by kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo wrote macrumors mitchel broussard on monday. apple doesnt report apple watch unit sales. but an ongoing analysis of the companys other products category which recognizes apple watch revenue in addition to revenue from apple tv beats products ipod and more led kuo to estimate the companys 00NUMBER00 apple watch shipments at about 00NUMBER00 million units. for 00NUMBER00 he predicts apple will ship about 00NUMBER00 million units. kuo cites a couple of reasons for predicting a decline in apple watch sales in 00NUMBER00. launch timing. perhaps most important for investors to understand about kuos prediction is his expected decline is heavily influenced by his expectations for the timing of an apple watch launch. the apple watch 00NUMBER00 will launch alongside the iphone 00NUMBER00 this fall he predicts. since the first apple watch was available for purchase in april of 00NUMBER00 the year over year availability for a new model will be at a significant disadvantage if kuos timeline for a 00NUMBER00 apple watch launch is correct. if the apple watch were launched in the fall instead of in april the company wouldnt have as much time to sell as many of the new versions of apple watch as it had in the prior year making a year over year comparison tough. apple ceo tim cook at an apple product launch event. image source apple. 00NUMBER00. product specs. kuo doesnt expect the version of apple watch unveiled this year to be significantly better than the first apple watch  at least not when it comes to form factor. mainly kuo only expects improvements to the devices internals and possibly minor form factor changes wrote broussard about kuos expectations. a more extensive refresh wont come until 00NUMBER00 to kuo. does apple watch matter    for now apple watch continues to represent a very small portion of apples business making it fairly unimportant to the companys results. indeed  apple stock  arguably prices in very little if any growth across the companys entire business in the coming years. if apple watch takes off then it would mostly be a bonus for apple shareholders. apple watch. image source apple. currently apples other products segment represents 00NUMBER00 of the companys total revenue but its worth noting that the category is growing quickly and this is likely attributable mostly to apple watch. revenue from other products was up 00NUMBER00 in apples most recent quarter compared to the year ago quarter but if apple watch sales taper off ahead of a fall launch for a new version of the device this segments growth could stall. longer term apple shareholders are likely hoping the segment could grow to become important to the companys bottom line even if the stock might not price in such a scenario. an outcome like this could help the stock outperform the overall stock market over the next five years. but if kuo is right about his prediction for the devices 00NUMBER00 sales could the category be less helpful in growing the companys revenue over the long haul than investors are hoping fora secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

in the pc market slowly chipping away at the windows world. mac updates these days are largely incremental since its such a mature product category. additionally the timing of future mac cycles is sort of up in the air right now as intel  is moving away  from its long standing tick tock model. but in the absence of cpu performance improvements apple can still drive demand with new industrial designs and continued operating system updates. the rise of detachables    categorically the pc market is also being partially cannibalized by rising sales of detachables and convertibles. the mac

be a hit. after all the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus lineup represented apples first foray into smartphones with displays larger than four inches. the consensus was right. during apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which coincides with the fourth calendar quarter 00NUMBER00 it reported a 00NUMBER00 year over year increase in iphone revenue. for the remainder of the fiscal year iphone 00NUMBER00 also continued to drive huge growth for the company. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. the flip side of such a significant quarter for apple however was the tough year over year comparisons it would now face in fiscal 00NUMBER00 after launching its iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. after the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch investors acknowledged that force touch a faster processor and other internal upgrades in the absence of any changes to the phones form factor  werent likely enough to drive fiscal 00NUMBER00 iphone sales high enough to help apple trump its huge growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00. indeed the first full quarter of iphone 00NUMBER00 sales previewed the tough year over year comparisons to come in the remainder of the year. when apple reported its first quarter results in january it revealed that it barely posted a year over year gain in revenue for the quarter reporting top line growth of just 00NUMBER00. even worse for the current quarter management predicted the direction of its year over year revenue comparisons would slip into a decline. specifically it guided for approximately 00NUMBER00 year over year drop in revenue 00NUMBER00. can the se help apple return to growth   addressing its expectations for declining revenue apple broke from its usual practice of introducing new iphones only on an annual basis and launched its iphone se on march 00NUMBER00 or mid cycle. as it was only available for one day during apples fiscal 00NUMBER00 however the new device is unlikely to help prevent the expected dip in revenue for the quarter that just ended. but what about 00NUMBER00 se. image source apple. with the iphone se set to be available during the the entire third quarter investors will look to apples third quarter guidance when it reports second quarter results later this month to see whether the new device is doing well enough in the market to help apple return to growth. as was the case in apples first and second fiscal quarters the company is up against some very tough comparisons in 00NUMBER00. in the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple reported quarterly revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion representing 00NUMBER00 revenue growth compared to the same quarter in fiscal 00NUMBER00. these results on the back of the blockbuster iphone 00NUMBER00 were driven mainly by huge year over year iphone revenue growth of 00NUMBER00. even if the iphone se is doing well in the market therefore this sort of year ago performance still wont be easily topped. investors will get a peek into managements expectations 00NUMBER00 when apple reports second quarter results on monday 00NUMBER00 after market close. for the company to return to growth look for apple to guide for 00NUMBER00

broader stock market on wednesday as the financial sector led a next round of risk on behavior. a look at my social media stream showed that bullish commentary on  apple stock  was about as loud as ever as aapl overcame a key area of technical resistance. while i see what the bulls are cheering for there are also reasons for me to borrow a phrase from legendary college football analyst lee

stock. on wednesday  motor trend  leaked pics of the rumored apple car   which may have helped propel the stock higher on the day. however without any details its too early to get either excited or disappointed about the prospects and thus little reason to chase apple stock higher. we see that despite a sharp 00NUMBER00 drop off its 00NUMBER00 highs aapl at the januaryfebruary double bottom held

never dare to bet against the company or the stock from a longer term perspective. looking at the nearer term picture however there are some concerns worth pointing out for those giddy to chase the stock higher on any breakout attempts. first lets note that off the januaryfebruary lows aapl has now rallied about 00NUMBER00 in a fairly steady if not too  steady manner. along the way near term technical areas of resistance were broken and the stock continuously squeezed higher. for a little perspective on this read my note on apple stock from feb. 00NUMBER00 i said the stock would be a buy for a trade on a push above the 00NUMBER00 area. getting right to the wood wednesdays rally in aapl stock pushed it above its red 00NUMBER00 day simple moving average for the first time since last november which chart chasing traders were quick to label bullish. but note that last november apple stock managed to remain above this moving average for an entire day and a half before quickly reversing lower. also the stock is still near the diagonal resistance line from last summer and right at the 00NUMBER00 retracement line measured from the lower high last november into the

shoulders above the competition. in the heavily watched metric of sales per square foot apple led all u. s. retailers with a figure of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 higher than high end jeweler tiffany co. even better for apple investors apple grew its retail sales per square foot 00NUMBER00 last year from 00NUMBER00 figure 00NUMBER00. the impetus for apples retail growth has been sales of the companys signature iphone product. apple grew iphone sales from inception to 00NUMBER00 billion last fiscal year. in the recently reported first quarter iphone growth substantially slowed. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million units during the quarter less than 00NUMBER00 higher than last years corresponding quarter. a report from consumer intelligence research partners or cirp points to further trouble ahead for both apples iphone and retail sales. more consumers are buying iphones from carriers    cirps data shows fewer u. s. iphone consumers are buying the phone directly from apple. last year the company reported 00NUMBER00 purchased the device direct from apple versus 00NUMBER00 two years earlier. instead these consumers are increasingly buying iphones from wireless carriers with this method growing 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 during the same time frame. three years ago apple ceo tim cook rallied his retail staff in an attempt to sell more iphones through apple stores. cirps data seems to point to these efforts as unfruitful side note two hour waits to talk to product specialists arent conducive to increased sales. selling a lower percentage of its own device is negative for apple on a few levels. perhaps the most direct way investors would be affected is in the companys margins. apple and carriers have been tight lipped in regard to selling fees but apple pays a fee for the carrier to sell the unit. so far this hasnt been an issue for the company. over the past two fiscal years apples been able to grow its heavily watched gross margin percentage from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 by raising iphone prices and controlling its supply chain. its possible the biggest risk is unable to be measured. as apples highest grossing product the iphone drives considerable traffic into apples retail stores. if a larger percentage of these purchases are occurring outside apples stores apple loses out on impulse buys and in hand direct product marketing. what to make of device subsidies    after t mobile   axed device subsidies in 00NUMBER00 for phone leasing plans theres been a shift among major carriers to decouple the cost of the device from the cost of wireless service. many predicted iphone sales would surge as carrier leasing plans would lead many consumers to upgrade smartphones annually instead of the traditional two year cycle. others predicted upgrade cycles would lengthen once consumers were aware of the devices real cost. the jury is still out but if last quarter is any indication the latter may be more indicative of apples future. during the first quarter conference call apple ceo tim cook said he expected apple unit shipments to fall in the current quarter. a larger percentage of iphones purchased through carriers combined with fewer subsidies seems to be a risk to both apples iphone revenue and the companys enviable retail sales per square foot metric. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

survey from btig. after looking at the upgrade rates at the four major carriers  verizon   att   t mobile   and sprint    btig saw a clear decline in customer phone upgrades. thats bad news for apple   says analyst walter piecyk. if the upgrade cycle is indeed elongating apple will sell fewer iphones per year especially as the smartphone market becomes saturated. apple is already experiencing the issue with the ipad which carries a much longer life cycle compared to the iphone. sales of the ipad declined 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00. with the iphone accounting for about two thirds of apples revenue last year investors need to figure out whats going on and whether apple can do anything to overcome this trend. whats causing the upgrade cycle to elongate   theres no clear reason why consumers arent upgrading their phones as often but there are several factors that may be contributors. the first factor is that the improvements in smartphones from year to year arent as great as they used to be. for example the iphone 00NUMBER00 biggest improvements were a better camera the introduction of 00NUMBER00 touch and live photos. none of these improvements make it a must own device. what might make more of a difference however is the price transparency provided by new installment plans from wireless carriers. t mobile started the trend of doing away with smartphone subsidies and the other major carriers have all started offering similar installment plans over the past couple years. not only do these plans show consumers the true cost of a smartphone they also provide a discount if they hold onto their phone for longer. thus smart consumers are incentivized to pay off their final installment and then stick with their cheaper service bill. a factor not considered   one more factor not considered in btigs survey of the four main wireless carriers are upgrades bought directly from apple or a third party. last year apple introduced its iphone upgrade program which lets consumers buy an unlocked iphone so its usable on any carrier and pay for it in installments just like the carriers. apple hasnt provided any details on the uptake on its program. considering the value the plan offers in its ability to switch carriers more easily and upgrade more often its reasonable to expect a larger number of iphones were bought directly from apple in the first and second quarter of its fiscal year. wireless carriers were threatened by apples own upgrade plan and responded with special promotions around the 00NUMBER00 launch. meanwhile other phone manufacturers like samsung   are experimenting with their own direct sales with installments plans. apple and samsung account for 00NUMBER00 of all smartphones in the u. s. what can apple do   the market is much tougher for apple now than when it received the benefit of subsidies from the wireless carriers and free upgrades every 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 months. and while apple will be hard pressed to overcome the trend of a longer upgrade cycle it can still do what its done best over the past few years grab market share. apples share of the u. s. market has grown from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 today. but its not only improving its share in the u. s. its doing so all over the world particularly in china. india represents another market with strong potential for huge iphone sales. apple is currently working to get approval to sell refurbished iphones in the country which would allow it to penetrate the mid range market. analysts are currently expecting apple to report negative iphone unit sales growth for the first time ever at the end of the month and management confirmed that its expecting a drop as well. until the upgrade cycle stabilizes again apple investors will have to rely on apples ability to penetrate international markets and grab further market share in order to grow sales. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

engine india. there are however a few problems. at least some groups in india certainly dont want apple. of equal concern is the high price point of apples handsets even so called entry level devices like the iphone se. apples latest iphone recently went on sale in india at a far higher cost than many apple investors likely expected. not so fast   true the iphone se costs less than other apple smartphones but that far from assures its success in india. case in point the lowest cost iphone se will reportedly retail for 00NUMBER00 rupees according to reports a full 00NUMBER00 higher than its estimated after tax cost in the u. s. the higher price doesnt reflect apple simply padding its margins either. rather apple appears to have refused to engage in wholesale price reductions for its third party indian distributors which forces its indian retailer partners to also add their own layer of pricing atop each devices current sticker price. you have to keep the lights on somehow right additional considerations like the cost of currency hedges and import tariffs also help elevate the cost of apples smartphones in india. either way this news appears to push apples supposed starter iphone toward the more premium end of its device lineup a space already occupied by apples current generation of larger screened smartphones. creating an additional obstacle for the iphone se evidence suggests indian consumers prefer larger screened smartphones and older large screened iphone models retail at lower prices than the se on indian e commerce sites. all told it seems the iphone se might have more going against it than for it in its supposed role as apples starter iphone. indeed those hoping for an easy path to success for apple in india could well have another thing coming. not yet the next china   beyond the pricing problems outline above the bull case for apple in india simply isnt quite as grand as it has been in other large emerging markets. china is the obvious comparison though investors would do well to dig deeper into how their key differences could affect apples international growth prospects. in terms of its total potential consumers india likely offers fewer buyers for apples devices today than china as its widely understood that china is wealthier than india. case in point indias 00NUMBER00 per capita gpd at purchasing power parity ppp of 00NUMBER00 at less than half of chinas estimated 00NUMBER00 per capita income last year. the natural response to this evidence is to say that though not necessarily rich the sheer enormity of indias population means that on an absolute basis there are still plenty of rich people living there to whom apple can peddle its wares. this was certainly a crucial piece of apples growth strategy in china. but while india indeed has ample numbers of wealthy individuals it still pales in comparison to china in this regard. image source capgemini. according to consulting company capgeminis 00NUMBER00 annual report on high net worth individuals hnwi defined as individuals with investable assets in excess of 00NUMBER00 million china outpaced india in terms of its population of wealthy citizens by a factor of over 00NUMBER00 times in 00NUMBER00. true this number reflects two year old data and one certainly doesnt need to be a high net worth individual to be able to purchase an iphone. but in terms of both breadth and depth of its wealth china vastly exceeds india a consideration that should loom large for investors hoping the country will become an overnight growth engine for the mac maker. granted indias long term growth potential is enviable to say the least. however the more i consider the state of affairs on the ground today the more skeptical i am that india will meaningfully influence apples results in the coming quarter. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a

next model of the device expected to launch sometime this year. still apple watch owners are a relatively small group accounting for just 00NUMBER00 of the survey respondents. apple is estimated to have sold somewhere between 00NUMBER00 million and 00NUMBER00 million apple watches in the nine months it was available in 00NUMBER00 below initial expectations for the device. kgi analyst ming chi kuo expects sales of the device to decline in 00NUMBER00 despite three extra months of sales due to his sources indicating the next model will only provide internal improvements similar to an s cycle update for iphone. even with more than 00NUMBER00 million likely buyers built in apple watch unit sales may not start growing until 00NUMBER00. whats holding back consumers   the biggest problem the apple watch faces is that its viewed as an accessory to the iphone. an expensive accessory. even with the recent 00NUMBER00 price cut at last months event the least expensive model costs 00NUMBER00. sixty nine percent of consumers cite cost as a reason they havent bought a smartwatch according to a survey from kentico and apple makes the most expensive models. even current apple watch owners note that price is the biggest disincentive for purchasing the device. but apple is unlikely to cut its price much more after it announces the new device. the price cut for the current apple watch came about one year after its release which is the same cycle for its other devices. it would be odd for apple to announce a further cut three months later. as such the new apple watch models will likely be priced the same as the original apple watch prices. what could make the next apple watch model a success   with price cuts all but ruled out the only way for apple to sell more watches is to make the device more valuable. it can do this with either hardware improvements which are reportedly going to be incremental internal improvements or software improvements which it can design itself or rely on third party app developers for. theres still been no breakthrough application for the watch and the top uses are basic functionalities like fitness tracking and listening to music. the apple watch is very overpriced as a fitness tracker compared to competing devices with more of a focus on fitness. but the apple watch is already the worlds most popular smartwatch. that makes it an excellent platform for developers to try new software. apps are largely responsible for the huge successes of the iphone and ipad and theyll drive sales of the apple watch as well or a lack thereof will correlate with a lack of sales. while apple watch owners are standing by wallets in hand to buy the next iteration of the device apple may have trouble growing sales. keep in mind that most current apple watch owners are big apple fans willing to buy just about anything apple releases so that skews the numbers a bit. but without a breakthrough improvement in either hardware or software which by the way could still happen the apple watch 00NUMBER00 may only sell a few million units this year. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show

 take. daniel sparks     the one thing ive learned following apples product launches over the years is that i dont   know about its product launches particularly when it comes to new product categories. for instance before imac ipod and iphone few came close to guessing what would make these devices special or even what they would look like. even the smart folks at google were totally caught off guard when apple revealed the iphone. hello mtapplecar   read the full cover story  httpst. 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 crap said former android engineer lead chris desalvo via  the atlantic    to one of his colleagues when watching the iphone unveil webcast. i guess were not going to ship that   phone. desalvo explained to the atlantic   that he realized the team would have to start all over on its plans for a new phone. as a consumer i was blown away. i wanted one immediately. but as a google engineer i thought were going to have to start over desalvo said. as has been the case with most of apples product launches if the company eventually does bring a car to market my guess is it will depart from what experts expect. of course not all of apples new product categories have been so revolutionary and its worth noting the advantage of having former ceo steve jobs behind all of these past products mentioned. furthermore even apple is prone to a total flop too. finally keep in mind that even if apple is planning a car it can always shelve its plans. so lets not get too excited. my main point here is that history shows that speculation around a new apple product category wont likely serve any useful purpose especially to investors. for the sake of fun sure. but nothing more. cute try though motor trend. chris neiger     the apple car will combine the simplicity and elegance that all of the companys devices embody. so of course that means the vehicle will probably have just one single port thats used to charge the electric vehicle and will have an optional dongle just in case you want to plug in your headphones or add an extra display. in terms of exterior design i cant imagine the car being anything but beautifully unapologetically plastic for lack of a better phrase. and on the inside its easy to imagine the apple watch becoming a technology hub for the car and definitely used to power the keyless entry system and start the vehicle for no other reason than for the apple watch to finally have a killer app. all kidding aside i envision an apple car with stunning designs that look more like tesla motors       vehicles than the futuristic mockups that look like they were contrived in the 00NUMBER00 that we saw from motor trend. if we ever see an apple car on the road its exterior will appeal to our visual senses first then to our tactile senses in the cabin and very lastly to our financial sensibilities due to its price tag. but what i think could really set apart an apple car from the rest of its competitors will be the cars operating system  because it will have one. this new os will be carplay evolved 00NUMBER00 times over. we already have well designed cars but what the automotive market lacks are well designed buttons and user interfaces. todays cars feel more like plane cockpits than driving machines and they are desperately in need of a simplicity overhaul. sure the apple car will look pretty itll probably be powered by batteries and may even have some semiautonomous features. but if the company truly lives up to its own legacy then the apple car will also be one of the most enjoyable vehicles youve ever interacted with with a truly unique operating system as its centerpiece. john rosevear     ive been an apple shareholder since 00NUMBER00. yes really. if ive learned anything about apple over those 00NUMBER00 sheesh years its that daniel is absolutely right apples new products always seem to be more than less than and just different  from what even genuine experts expect all at the same time. but that said we can make some predictions about the much rumored apple car that might be useful. i made a big one last year when i said that i thought that apple was more likely planning a disruptive subscription based automated apple car service   than a car for retail sale. i still think thats likely simply because to my mind which is grounded in my knowledge of the mainstream car business thats where the best opportunity lies for an apple like business that would be genuinely disruptive and profitable. if thats the case then the apple car will probably resemble a limousine or a minivan like small bus as reimagined by jony ive and the apple design team. in other words i cant say what itll look like except to say that it wont look like a sleek low slung tesla model s and most of us will probably like it. itll have sensational connectivity itll be fully integrated with the apple device ecosphere and itll be fast and comfortable and smooth riding and very very safe. i also think that apple wouldnt build a car factory from scratch to build its self driving apple car service cars. instead it would pay to have its cars built by an automaker it saw as sufficiently like minded and perfectionistic to work with perhaps bmw  or daimler  s mercedes benz unit. 00NUMBER00 awesome features of the mtapplecar    httpst. 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 said i dont rule out the possibility that apple will try to bring a car to the retail market. but i think its unlikely. a lot of the tech oriented analysts and pundits who talk up that possibility dont seem to realize that profitably mass producing cars to global standards of quality is very very difficult even when the cars arent full of radical new technology. mass production is arguably the auto industrys real moat one that tesla is presently struggling to bridge as it gears up to build the model 00NUMBER00. i have no doubt that apple has the money intelligence tenacity and patience to bridge that moat  and start building cars on its own. but hiring an established automaker to build apple cars for an apple car service makes a lot more sense. i still dont have any idea what that car will look like. but i think its safe to say that no matter the business model that apple chooses for its car it wont look like motor trend  s very un apple renderings. as with all things apple we dont know what we dont know. but we can make some educated guesses about what an apple car would have based on what we know about the company. first off the most obvious are that the apple car would be electric autonomous and connected. apple likes to jump into areas where it thinks that it can have a positive impact and catalyzing ev adoption would play right into its corporate value of environmental sustainability. self driving cars are all the rage these days as the technology races toward feasibility and regulators continue to consider the implications. cellular connectivity is a no brainer and connected cars in some form or fashion have been around for many years. we could also expect a heavy emphasis on the user interface combined with deep integration of hardware and software. apple music integration would be a given streaming over the cellular connection. apple car would communicate seamlessly with the other apple devices you have and youd be able to dictate tasks to siri. imagine telling siri to drive you home because youve had a few too many drinks. interestingly all of the miniaturization experience that apple has accumulated over the years making progressively thinner and lighter mobile devices would be mostly irrelevant here since cars have no need for extreme miniaturization. while john has a compelling case for an apple car as a service only i believe that the company will still cater to the traditional ownership model. car sharing is on the rise but even elon musk one of the biggest proponents of autonomous vehicles believes that long term car ownership will still be around two thirds of the market. people simply like owning their cars even if its technically not the most efficient model once autonomy is feasible. however autonomous car sharing will be a big hit in urban areas. the underlying monetization method that has always been at the heart of apples business is simply selling great products to consumers. the apple car as a service model would be a pretty significant departure from that. owning operating and maintaining a massive fleet of any product in active deployment doesnt sound like the typical apple business. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the article heres what the apple car might

close many american families have had to fork over a pretty penny for selling investments. of course this doesnt necessarily apply to tax advantaged retirement accounts but there are still a lot of families that have side money invested in the stock market for non retirement purposes. today im going to tell you how many most actually  american families could sell their stock investments for a gain and not owe uncle sam a penny. heres how it works. ever notice this before    for starters you absolutely must  own the stocks you are going to sell for at least a year. once you get beyond 00NUMBER00 days your investment is considered a long term one and that opens it to a host of tax advantages. if you follow the buy to hold investment philosophy that we preach here at the motley fool this shouldnt be too hard. next lets take a look at how those long term capital gains are taxed by the federal government. source authors illustration with information provided by the irs. if your household falls under the 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 tax bracket then you can sell your investments up until they bump you into a new tax bracket and pay absolutely no taxes whatsoeverwhat do those tax brackets look like according to the tax foundation this is what the upper limit of the 00NUMBER00 bracket will look like. filing typeupper limit of taxable 00NUMBER00 of 00NUMBER00 filing 00NUMBER00 the tax foundationbut arent these the exceedingly poor households    thats a fair question. on the surface it would appear that only those who are poor would qualify for this break. once you scratch the surface however a different picture appears. for starters heres the breakdown of the average american household via data from the bureau of labor statistics. number of people in household 00NUMBER00 income before taxes 00NUMBER00 if we assume that the average household is a married couple and we dont take any deductions whatsoever  which would never happen the average american household could still sell stocks and net gains of over 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 without ever having to turn over a dime for those gains. lets put this in perspective    to really get an idea of how possible this is lets look at the extreme end of the spectrum a family of four that 00NUMBER00 before taxes. this is the type of demographic that even naysayers would agree could probably be making such investments meaning they have enough money left over to invest. again on the surface it would seem absurd that this family could possibly avoid capital gains taxes. but lets take a look at four very simple deductions that the family could claim. deductionamountstandard 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 contributions maxing both 00NUMBER00 savings acct. 00NUMBER00 the tax foundation for standard deduction and exemptions irs. just like that the amount of taxable income that this family has drops basically in half all the way to 00NUMBER00. that means that if say the family has been sitting on shares of apple  for five years and has seen their shares increase by 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 they could sell and keep all the gains for themselves. added up over the years if this family regularly takes advantage of such situations the tax savings can be enormous. further if they simply wait thirty days they can repurchase the shares they sold raising their cost basis and helping them lock in long term gains tax freegranted this strategy wont work for everyone you need to have the right life circumstances and an eye for detail to make it work. but if you do the advantages come retirement time can certainly add up. another way to boost your nest egg the 00NUMBER00 security bonus most retirees completely overlook   if youre like most americans youre a few years or more behind on your retirement savings. but a handful of little known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. in fact one marketwatch reporter argues that if more americans knew about this the government would have to shell out an extra 00NUMBER00 billion annually. for example one easy 00NUMBER00 minute trick could pay you as much as 00NUMBER00 more. . . each year once you learn how to take advantage of all these loopholes we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind were all after. simply click here to discover how you can take advantage of these strategies. the article how the average american family can avoid the capital gains tax altogether this year  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc.

watchlist  at stock options channel is apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the august expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the august expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost   for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to happen meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the views and opinions expressed

think of a sixth birthday of a product it should come at a time of incredible growth. however as its turns 00NUMBER00 apples ipad business finds itself mired in a period of stagnation if not outright decline. once billed as the next great pillar of apples consumer electronics empire its probably safe to say that the ipad hasnt lived up to its once lofty expectations. perhaps more relevant to investors today are two questions what happened and what does the future hold for apples famous tabletrise and fall of apples ipad   the press release noting the debut of the ipad which officially went on sale april 00NUMBER00 simply oozed classic apple marketing. ipad is something completely new said steve jobs apples ceo at the time. were excited for customers to get their hands on this magical and revolutionary product and connect with their apps and content in a more intimate intuitive and fun way than ever before. though debatably over the top language apple indisputably had a winner on its hands as consumers snapped up new ipads at historic rates. ipad sales surpassed the 00NUMBER00 million mark in a record 00NUMBER00 days and 00NUMBER00 million in less than 00NUMBER00 days both well ahead of the company record set by the iphone. as of the most recent tally apple has sold more than 00NUMBER00 million ipads and unlike the iphone apples tablet has consistently remained the most popular tablet in the world since it launched. however for all its success important shifts also began to eat away at apples tablet business. most notably apples 00NUMBER00 decision to increase the screen size of its more profitable iphone likely ate into apples tablet shipments especially in the case of the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad mini. also relatively few ipads are purchased with cellular capabilities which always prevented the ipad from enjoying the same carrier subsidy model that has helped support smartphone buying cycles for some time. the gradual evolution of the laptop has also likely contributed to the more recent pullback in ipad sales. more to the point the distinction between the two has increasingly blurred with the rise in so called detachable laptops and keyboard enabled tablets like apples own 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro or microsoft  s surface suite of tablets. in its most recent 00NUMBER00 apple 00NUMBER00 million ipads down 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. source apple. a failure in only one way   even after the ipads recent year over year sales declines its impossible to view it as anything other than a resounding success for apple and its investors. though less profitable than the iphone the ipad has nonetheless generated billions in profits for the company. whats more apples management continues to signal its bullishness on the form factor and apples place in the tablet market. in fact the only way someone can justifiably argue the ipad has proven to be a letdown is relative to the once lofty expectations from analysts and research firms. as was noted by recode well respected market analysis firms like gartner  predicted in the early phase of the tablet market that the market would sell more than 00NUMBER00 million devices annually appreciably higher than the 00NUMBER00 million that actually shipped last year according to idc. however any fair assessment of these expectations should in hindsight admit they were perhaps a bit lofty. going forward the major trends influencing the tablet market will likely remain firmly in place particularly the continued merging of the tablet and laptop form factor. as one of the strongest players in either market apples place as a leader in this ongoing evolution is all but assured. however predicting what apples tablet business will look like even into the medium term say five years is by no means clear. either way as it settles into what appears to be a rapidly maturing market apples ipad despite recent sales declines remains anything but a failure for the worlds largest tech company. after all not every product can be as successful as the iphone. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few

skylake processors. the chip giant has had its skylake chips ready for use in the macbook for a little while but now apple has pulled the trigger and added them to the mix. the new sixth generation core m processors now feature improved integrated graphics intel hd graphics 00NUMBER00 faster pcie based flash storage better battery life and faster memory as well. the company is also added its rose gold finish to the product alongside the existing space grey silver and gold colors. pricing remains unchanged with the macbook starting 00NUMBER00. does it matter    this is a pretty standard refresh and its about time since the redesigned retina macbook was introduced just about a year ago. there had been a possibility that apple was going to refresh the laptop at its march event but it instead chose to focus on the new iphone se and 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. while the refresh is a welcome update the macbook still has some inherent compromises simply due to the fact that the market isnt totally ready for it. but being ahead of its time has never stopped apple before. i still consider the new macbook to be the best product  that apple launched last year but not in terms of unit share or revenue. slowly but surely apple continues to gain global pc market share and ongoing refreshes help the company keep that momentum. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

iphones in the april june quarter in light of sluggish sales. the information about these cuts apparently comes parts suppliers notified of the plan. should long term apple investors worry about this news lets take a closer look. some background    theres no beating around the bush here the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle has proved to be something of a mess for apple. the company guided to the first ever year over year drop in iphone shipments in the march quarter confirming the reports that had been swirling at the time that apple was cutting production of the latest iphone 00NUMBER00 plus phones. according to ceo tim cook on the earnings call about three months ago the march quarter which apple will report results for on april 00NUMBER00 is expected to be the toughest compare. this the executive said was due to two key factors. first apples supply was heavily constrained in the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 so sales that would have been recognized in the first quarter had supply been sufficient were pushed into the second quarter. second cook said that from a currencymacroeconomic point of view things have deteriorated meaningfully from the prior year. going into the companys fiscal third quarter the year over year comparison becomes a little bit cleaner since there wasnt any demand push out into the fiscal third quarter of 00NUMBER00 to skew the comparison. it would seem though that demand is proving to be more challenging than what apple had anticipated. build plan reductions are bad news for apple    the initial build plans for the fiscal third quarter that apple likely shared with its suppliers probably factored in the weakness that the idevice maker saw during its fiscal first quarter and early on in the fiscal second quarter. if apple is now telling its suppliers that it will be ordering fewer parts this strongly suggests that apples internal demand forecasts have been lowered yet again. it doesnt offer guidance beyond a quarter but the investor takeaway is this had apple publicly shared its shipment expectations for the april june quarter back in january it would most likely need to revise that guidance down later this month. apples iphone business is looking shaky im avoiding the stock    its becoming plain as day that apples iphone business is not in particularly good shape. despite the significant technical advancements in the iphone 00NUMBER00 significantly updated 00NUMBER00 touch capability more marketable cameras and so on demand is apparently soft. to make matters worse apple not only has a fairly strong set of flagship phones but the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus that were so popular in fiscal 00NUMBER00 are cheaper than ever in fiscal 00NUMBER00. even with a markedly stronger lineup at lower price points this fiscal year compared to last iphone sales are still reportedly weaker than originally hoped. to add even more fuel to the fire generally reliable kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo has been talking a lot about the radical changes that are expected to come to the 00NUMBER00. there has been little leaked from kuo or from other sources about the details of the iphone that apple will be releasing this year. this has led some to believe that the update that it has in store for 00NUMBER00 isnt going to be as exciting as one would expect from a typical new number iphone. if apple doesnt make the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of phones really  exciting not just to techie nerds such as yours truly but to the general public then the company could be looking at yet another year of iphone declines. at this point there is simply too much uncertainty around the demand trends for the iphone to make me feel comfortable about buying the stock. whenif iphone demand turns a corner it will be worth revisiting whether  apple stock  deserves a place in my portfolio. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode

heavily supply constrained throughout the whole 00NUMBER00 and so some of that demand moved into 00NUMBER00. hopefully cook will provide an update on how the company views iphone sales comparisons for the rest of the year and  if were lucky maybe a glimpse at his long term view for iphone sales. 00NUMBER00. how is the iphone se performing in greater china    apples march introduced iphone se  was a huge departure from its typical new iphones. for the first time ever the company basically went back and revamped one of its older iphones relaunching it with a new name and new guts. launched between apples usual iphone announcements for flagship versions of the smartphone the company appears to be aiming to create a more competitive offering for more price sensitive markets markets like greater china. iphone ses guts are no joke. image source apple. its not surprising apple wanted to launch an iphone that would appeal specifically to greater china. in the companys most recent quarter greater china represented a whopping 00NUMBER00 the apples revenue second only to its americas market which stands at 00NUMBER00 of revenue. some early data  when iphone se was launched suggested the new phone is indeed a hit in china. three days before shipments of the device began apple raked in 00NUMBER00 million in pre orders from non apple retailers for the iphone se according to a report from cnbc. perhaps apple will provide some insight into how well the new phone is holding up in the companys important greater china market. 00NUMBER00. hows the quality of apples pipeline    finally investors will want to look for an update from management on the companys confidence in its pipeline. given apples love of secrecy about future products dont expect anything very detailed. but apple has provided vague yet useful information about its pipeline in the past. for instance ahead of the apple watch the company made it very clear it would soon launch a product in a new category and the ceo even was as specific as to note that he thought wearables would become a very key branch of the tree. apple watch. image source apple. as apple struggles to grow revenue could cook tease investors with some hints about the companys pipeline at the very least investors should look for the ceo to express high confidence in its upcoming products. apple reports results for its second fiscal quarter after market close on tuesday april 00NUMBER00. the company will host a live conference call to discuss the results in a qa session with analysts at 00NUMBER00 p. m. pst. a secret billion dollar stock

the companys most recently released handset the iphone se sports a 00NUMBER00 inch display downright tiny by 00NUMBER00 standards. most of apples competitors reserve such pint sized phones for the bargain bin equipping them with subpar internals that make for a less than ideal user experience. in this regard the iphone se is dramatically different and unique boasting speedy silicon that allows it to stand toe to toe with its much larger rivals. but theres something even more intriguing about the iphone se its price tag. starting at 00NUMBER00 the iphone se is 00NUMBER00 than the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 cheaper than the iphone 00NUMBER00. given its relative affordability many have speculated that the iphone se is an iphone aimed explicitly at emerging markets whose consumers lack the purchasing power of their counterparts in more developed economies. that may be the case but apple will be fighting an uphill battle emerging market buyers have demonstrated a strong preference for smartphones with much larger screens. when you only have a smartphone every inch matters   phablets oversized smartphones that border on the realm of traditional tablets were viewed skeptically in developed economies when they began to emerge in 00NUMBER00. that extra screen real estate made watching videos and playing games easier but came with a fair number of trade offs some of which apple emphasized in its advertising. in a television spot for 00NUMBER00 before the release of the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 apple declared that going with a 00NUMBER00 inch display was simply a matter of common sense given that the smaller size meant you could hold the phone in your palm and navigate around the screen with your thumb. but emerging market consumers took to the phablet with far greater zeal. in the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 phablets outsold both tablets and laptops combined in the asia pacific region  excluding japan. by the third quarter smartphones with displays larger than 00NUMBER00 inches represented over one fifth of total handsets sold globally with asian economies driving most of the demand. emerging market buyers many of whom lack traditional pcs and home wi fi connections were drawn to the cellular equipped phablet as the perfect all in one device small enough to double as a phone large enough to replace a pc. in 00NUMBER00 research firm jana conducted a survey of smartphone users across several different emerging markets. consumers in countries such as india indonesia the philippines vietnam and mexico overwhelmingly said they wanted phones with screens that were 00NUMBER00 inches or larger. unsurprisingly apple saw an unprecedented increase in demand following the release of the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 inches and for a time became the largest seller of smartphones in china. its chinese rivals which have overtaken it in recent months sell a larger variety of phones but almost all sport fairly large displays. youd be hard pressed to find a xiaomi phone much smaller than 00NUMBER00 inches. even its ultra low priced redmi 00NUMBER00 boasts a 00NUMBER00 inch panel. the same is true for huawei but to an even greater extent. in recent quarters huawei has emerged as one of the worlds largest sellers of tablets. in the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 for example it shipped 00NUMBER00 million units according to research firm idc. a far cry from apples 00NUMBER00 million but huaweis growth was far more impressive up a stunning 00NUMBER00 on an annual basis. source idc. huaweis approach to the tablet market however is unique most of the companys tablets are equipped with cellular radios. huaweis focus remains on cellular connected tablets wrote idc. its difficult to say for certain how consumers are choosing to use these huawei slates but they may be using them more like phones than tablets. huaweis 00NUMBER00 sports 00NUMBER00 inch display and comes equipped with an lte radio. in the u. s. lte tablets arent unheard of but they are less popular and often have larger displays. a great phone but not the perfect solution for emerging markets   the iphone se has received rave reviews and for 00NUMBER00 offers great value compared to the rest of apples lineup. its existence doesnt pose a risk to apples bottom line if anything it could help endear its handsets to consumers turned off by the prospect of fumbling with a giant phone. but with emerging market consumers demonstrating a strong preference for bigger handsets its unlikely to lead apple to emerging market dominance. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres

earlier this week apple posted the above poem to announce the dates for its upcoming world wide developers conference wwdc one of the most important events the company holds each year. heres a quick preview of the products and topics expected to dominate the discussion at wwdc 00NUMBER00 being held june 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. ios 00NUMBER00 a virtual lock that apple will use the opening wwdc keynote presentation to debut updates to its mobile and desktop operating systems. heres what the rumor mill is kicking about in terms of apples upcoming mobile software update. starting with the most plausible it appears apple will enable users to hide at least some of the default apps game center stocks etc. that the company has long locked into the home screen. one app store analytics company noticed an interesting bit of code apple recently added to all app store apps which reads isfirstpartyhideableapp. this would be convenient but far from game changing. however given the public deployment of this new code this rumor seems relatively bankable. goodbye game center. apple is also reportedly developing a new app to further its efforts to dominate our increasingly smart homes. predictably dubbed home the app will serve as the missing hub to connect disparate ios enabled devices in a single place. with smart appliances and other gadgets only likely to increase in number and importance  in our homes in coming years apples efforts to create a single unified space seems like a win for users and the company. additionally apple has reportedly been experimenting with a new voice mail dictation service powered by siri. the service which is reportedly still being tested by apple employees would allow siri to transcribe your voicemail messages and send you the transcript. siri would then send the transcript of her interaction with the caller as an email or imessage to a users iphone. the features inclusion in ios 00NUMBER00 reportedly hinges on siris translational accuracy. as you can imagine there is no shortage of rumors regarding ios 00NUMBER00 content but these are a few that appear most often in reading on the subject. source appleos x fuji   like its mobile os brethren count on apple debuting the newest version of its mac software during the wwdc keynote. there hasnt been the same intensity to the speculation about osx but several potential features that ive seen discussed could still prove quite alluring. primary among them is apples likely move to bring siri to the mac. when plugging into a power charger mac users will reportedly be able to summon apples digital assistant using the traditional hey siri invocation. it isnt clear if apple has any desktop specific improvements planned. either way this would represent only the latest step in the growing feature convergence between apples mobile and desktop platforms in recent years. theres also some speculation that apple plans to overhaul the photos app which the company emphasized over its legacy iphoto product in last years update. details arent exactly clear as to whether this purported upgrade would more likely impact the desktop mobile or both versions of photos. new apple watch    like ios and osx it seems safe to expect apple to preview the latest version of its smartwatch software watchos at this years wwdc. the question that has arisen in recent months is whether apples watch update will also involve new hardware. source apple. for those who dont recall apple launched the apple watch last april but it used last years wwdc keynote to preview its second generation watchos 00NUMBER00 software. the timing in doing so seems favorable. a june launch window would allow for more than a year passing since the original apple watch shipped which could help sooth some potential criticism from those irked by potential new hardware upgrades. a june debut would also allow apple to place a greater emphasis on the expected form factor update for the companys rainmaking iphone lineup later this fall. many expect apple iphone shipments to stall in coming quarters which will put increased pressure on apple to deliver something more than an incremental upgrade to its smartphone lineup. we still have several months to go before well know firsthand what apple has in store for its next marquee event. expect to see the rumor mill rev into high gear in the intervening months ahead of apples june wwdc. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. apple  is scheduled to report earnings on april 00NUMBER00 for the quarter ended in march the second quarter of its fiscal year. variables such as iphone sales revenue guidance and dividend announcements could be especially important in the coming earnings report. its all about the iphone    the iphone generates almost 00NUMBER00 of total revenue so this segment is absolutely crucial for apple in terms of financial performance. the company is facing considerable challenges in this key business and analysts will closely scrutinize iphone sales volume and prices in different geographies. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models were launched in september 00NUMBER00 and they produced booming sales growth for the company as customers enthusiastically embraced the new form factors with larger screens. as a reference iphone revenue grew 00NUMBER00 during the quarter ended in march 00NUMBER00 while total company level sales increased 00NUMBER00. comparisons in the coming earnings report will be remarkably difficult and management is anticipating declining sales. the companys guidance is for revenue to be in the range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion compared to 00NUMBER00 billion in the same quarter last year. for what its worth wall street analysts are on average expecting 00NUMBER00 billion in sales so forecasts from analysts are in line with the companys guidance. demand for tablets and pcs has been quite lackluster lately so there is little reason to expect much growth from these products. apple is betting on expansion with new products and services such as apple pay apple music the revamped apple tv and apple watch. but even taken together these areas will most probably have a modest impact on overall financial performance though they could be important in terms of what they say about the company and its ability to drive sustainable growth. innovation is key for apple. if the company proves to investors that it can still bring successful new products and services to the market this could provide more visibility about apples ability to produce consistent revenue growth beyond the iphone. revenue guidance    the stock market is a forward looking mechanism and investment decisions need to be based on the future potential of the business not past performance. for this reason what apple says about revenue and earnings in the coming quarter could be even more important than financial performance for the past quarter. comparisons will also be quite challenging in the june ended quarter since apple reported a massive increase of 00NUMBER00 in iphone revenue during that quarter last year. however the company launched the new iphone se on march 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and this could be a considerable plus in terms of revenue growth. the iphone se has a 00NUMBER00 inch screen and it sells for a competitively low starting price of 00NUMBER00. price competitiveness could be a major advantage in emerging markets where income levels are comparatively lower and the carrier subsidy model is not as extended as in the u. s. emerging markets are still offering considerable room for growth. iphone unit sales 00NUMBER00 in china and overall constant currency sales in india 00NUMBER00 last quarter so management seems to be doing the smart thing by betting on these regions for future growth. interestingly ceo tim cook said in the last conference call that nearly 00NUMBER00 of all iphone users have not yet upgraded to the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00. perhaps a considerable portion of these users prefer the smaller devices and the iphone se could be just what apple needs to convince these customers to upgrade their models. dividend growth    apple is maturing as a business and this makes it harder for the company to produce rapid sales growth. on the other hand a more stable and mature company also means an increased ability to distribute excess cash flow to investors via dividends and everything indicates that apple will announce a new dividend increase in the coming earnings release. the company is committed to raising dividends on an annual basis and it has announced dividend hikes in its earnings reports for the march quarter over the past three years. the dividend increases for 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 were 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 respectively so most investors are probably expecting a dividend increase in the high single digits to low double digits. apple produces far more cash than it needs to reinvest in the business so it makes sense to expect increased dividend payments from the company. importantly the size of the dividend hike can send an important signal to investors in terms of evaluating the level of confidence management has in its ability to generate consistently growing cash flows over the years ahead. the bigger the dividend increase the higher the degree of confidence management is showing. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  roughly one year after its highly publicized debut investors only have a vague idea of exactly how large apple  s smartwatch business has grown. though its management loves describing the apple watchs performance in fawning terms like exceeded expectations  this only describes one facet of the apple watchs reception with consumers. with the second generation apple watch due out later this year hopes are high that apple will seize on the watershed potential some believe the smartwatch offers. unfortunately for those optimists one well known apple analyst recently predicted otherwise. one vote against the apple watch 00NUMBER00 week kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo penned a note to investors containing a number of predictions about the apple watch 00NUMBER00. according to kuo the device will only provide modest improvements over its predecessor akin to the s series follow up devices apple has utilized as part of its two year iphone form factor cycle. based on his checks into apples asian supply chain complex kuo claims the apple watch 00NUMBER00 will utilize the same form factor as the original apple watch a fact he believes will lead to disappointing watch sales for the fiscal year. all told kuo believes apple watch shipments will actually contract by as much as 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. according to his analysis apple will sell only 00NUMBER00 million watches down from the 00NUMBER00 million it sold 00NUMBER00 according to idc estimates. importantly this differs to fair extent from at least another well known analysts recent apple watch 00NUMBER00 predictions. not the only one    earlier this month longtime apple analyst brian white of drexel hamilton published an investor note after returning from a spate of meetings with executives at apple supply chain partners in asia. flying somewhat in the face of kuos views white predicted that the apple watch 00NUMBER00 would be 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 thinner than the original. white also believes apple will use its upcoming world wide developers conference wwdc in june as the venue to debut the apple watch 00NUMBER00. source applethough far from certain this purported launch window does make sense. especially if the apple watch 00NUMBER00 lacks some of the game changing features enthusiasts have long awaited launching in the summer could serve the tactical purpose of leaving apples fall launch event to focus on the iphone 00NUMBER00. either way both reports paint the forthcoming apple watch release as being more incremental than incredible. should investors be worriedhow meaningful a problem is it   determining just how problematic an uninspiring second generation apple watch might be for the company and its shareholders depends on your interpretation of these rumors should they prove close to accurate. one could view this result as supporting the idea that the pace of innovation is indeed slowing at apple. though it was once the undisputed design leader in consumer electronics as any number of commentators have noted  myself included   its been some time since apple debuted a product that truly represented a major advancement or milestone in its market. is incrementalism a pattern of offering great but not revolutionary products like the iphone 00NUMBER00 or ipad pro a sign that the inherent tension between managing apples finances and developing new products has finally hobbled the firmon the other hand might these seeming design issues simply speak to the hardware challenges inherent in creating a truly intelligent smartwatch much has been made of the promise in areas like preventative medicine that could extend from smartwatches becoming real time trackers of biometric data like blood sugar levels blood oxygen levels and more. however leading publications have repeatedly suggested  the technological breakthroughs required for such feats might prove significantly more difficult than some industry watchers imagine. then again perhaps apple is simply focusing the bulk of its design efforts on its most high impact areas like the iphone and ambitious initiatives such as its automotive effort project titan. or maybe the truly game changing apple watch is just one generation away. each of these arguments and several more strike me as at least reasonably plausible. given that id suggest that attempting to diagnose the real source of apples purportedly less than inspiring apple watch 00NUMBER00 plans is  for now a futile effort. whats more though it seems visibility into apples supply chain has perhaps increased as the firm has grown the analysts claims referred to above remain rumors at best. both kuo and white have respectable track records in predicting apples product and business decisions but no analyst gets every call right. as such id say branding the apple watch 00NUMBER00 already dead in the water strikes me as a bit premature. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

for apple. earnings are seen falling to 00NUMBER00 per share from 00NUMBER00 per share in the year ago period while revenue is expected to dive 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion. slowing iphone shipments are the main culprit for the poor year over year comparisons and rumors that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will not bring any major design changes  have created a bit of a stir for guidance. despite these warning signs expectations remain high for aapl stock. earningswhispercom places apples fiscal second quarter whisper number at 00NUMBER00 per share. but earnings beats are par for the course

according to a research note from respected kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo via macrumors   apple  is on track to see a steep decline in iphone shipments 00NUMBER00. the analyst cites three major factors driving what he expects to be a double digit decline in iphone shipments for the year. the first is that the market for high end smartphones has gotten more aggressive. indeed apples flagships are now being outdone in significant ways compared to what competitors are doing display quality device thickness camera quality etc. quite often at lower price points too. next kuo blames time needed for commercialization of new user experience technologies. it isnt clear to me what kuo means by this but i suspect that he may be referring to the fact that apple is sometimes slow to adopt interesting features and technologies at least compared to peers. finally kuo argues that the iphone is in need of a dramatic overhaul in terms of industrial designform factor. the 00NUMBER00 family looks largely like the iphone 00NUMBER00 family and current rumors suggest that the iphone 00NUMBER00 wont be much of a departure in the looks department from the current iphone 00NUMBER00. could fiscal 00NUMBER00 be another bad year for apple    at this point i think investors have mostly written off 00NUMBER00 as a bad year for the idevice maker. its clear that the iphone 00NUMBER00 phones werent good enough to convince users to upgrade and for a while all eyes have been on iphone 00NUMBER00 as the product that will allow apple to turn it all around in 00NUMBER00. however according to kuo the iphone 00NUMBER00 wont have many attractive selling points. given that he is well known for being plugged into apples supply chain this claim is very hard to dismiss. execution issues at apple    the fact that apple is getting outgunned by lesser known china based smartphone players in terms of both sales growth and in some cases features appear to be a reflection of execution issues. a company that lives and dies by providing customers with best in class user experiences and as a company that has by far the highest average selling prices in the industry there is no excuse for the its products being anything less than the best. however apples current flagships are behind in terms of display performancequality camera performance and arguably even form factor. to be blunt it would seem that the iphone 00NUMBER00 that is being described in the press is the phone that should have been launched in late 00NUMBER00 and the massively redesigned 00NUMBER00 iphone kuo has mentioned repeatedly should be what apple is putting out this year. how can apple course correct    the best way for apple to course correct would be to shorten the lifecycle of the upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00. this phone should be in the market until perhaps the june time frame. at that point it would make sense for apple to jump start iphone sales with the brand new redesigned model. if apple really wants to get fancy it could commit to shorter nine month product cycles. this would require it to invest more in technologyproduct development teams to support an accelerated schedule but the incremental spending would likely be peanuts compared to the potential for an acceleration in revenue growth. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are

this morning that apple  is looking to add cellular connectivity to the next apple watch alongside a faster processor. the underlying reason being that apple watch currently relies a little too heavily on being paired to an iphone for data connectivity and location information. that might be a tough sell. do you need a third data plan    even in the ipad its taking a long time for the market to warm up to the idea of cellular connectivity. sure having a connection is incredibly convenient but most people dont really want to add another data package to pay for on their monthly bill especially since you can tether to your phones data plan pretty easily these days. for instance cellular tablets comprised just 00NUMBER00 of the u. s. market in 00NUMBER00 according to npd. adoption has been rising though albeit slowly. npd also found that affluent and educated consumers were far more likely to pay up for the option. but a lot of people still dont find the extra upfront cost combined with a higher monthly bill worth it and wi fi only models are still the most popular option. carriers are helping cellular tablet adoption    wireless carriers are doing the best they can to promote cellular tablet sales. t mobile  introduced a free data plan a couple years ago where users can get 00NUMBER00 mb per month at no cost. thats not an awful lot of data but it does encourage users to at least upgrade to a cellular model if they know they can get light cellular usage. customers can also often buy cellular tablets on installment plans much like phones these days. that also spreads out the cost of the premium. carriers also offer occasional promotions for cellular tablets. of course the goal is that every now and then youll decide to buy some more data perhaps while traveling. we dont know what we dont know    as with all apple rumors its unclear how apple may or may not implement the feature. untethering the apple watch from the iphone seems necessary in order to make the watch a more viable stand alone device. but requiring cellular connectivity might be too much to ask. the best way to add cellular connectivity would be to include it at no additional cost unlike the ipad where cellular connectivity costs an extra 00NUMBER00. more important the market might accept it if its bundled in a shared data plan as opposed to a separate data plan. while many carriers in the u. s. are aggressively transitioning to shared data plans not all of them are. in which case deploying cellular connectivity in apple watch becomes even more convoluted. theres really no simple solution. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the article we dont need cellular apple watches  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has

gone as apple is now a stodgy old guard technology company no different than anyone else in the space. while this has allowed aapl to be a big dividend payer growth levels have certainly declined. some are even talking about peak iphone with the prospect of lower sales in the near future for apples signature product. thus the earnings number might not matter too much for aapl this quarter. the company does a great job of managing expectations and investors are going to be zeroing in on iphone sales and expectations for future deliveries as the key driver for aapl stock. additionally look for any news about the watch or the car though this one isnt likely to help set expectations for the longer term in apple as well. for more information on apple earnings make sure to watch our short

advice trading tipshere are your apple rumors  to kick off the weeksource applewatch   the first  apple watch  nasdaq  aapl    has been a hit selling about 00NUMBER00 million units and it looks like its successor will appeal to a wider consumer base. it will probably come as no surprise that the device will include a faster processor but the real impressive feature is built in cellular connectivity. other companies have developed smartwatches with 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 and it looks like apple is catching up with its rivals by adding cellular capabilities to the new watch. macbook   one of the tech giants key products will include several game changing improvements   including a better processor that will increase the speed of the laptops functions. additionally the macbooks battery life will be longer by approximately one hour stronger cpus and crisper graphics. to top it all off the device will be even lighter than any apple laptops currently on the market. vr   to round up the days apple rumors a virtual reality device or some form of vr functionality may be coming in the near future. the company has yet to confirm such a product but its interest in vr has long been discussed and it looks like its only a matter of time until an announcement is made. back in january ceo tim cook announced that the technology is more than a niche and it could be quite useful in the future. aapl stock is down 00NUMBER00 monday. earnings confirm it gm stock is a 00NUMBER00 stocks you should put out to 00NUMBER00 best cheap stocks to buy now 00NUMBER00 post monday

advice trading tipsthat sound you hear thats me tearing my hair out over what to do with apple inc. aapl    stock. for years i have regarded  apple stock  as a growth at a reasonable price stock commonly referred to as a garp stock. yet as i hunted and dug into what apple stock was really all about my position has been sorely tested. heres what i like about apple stock and about apple inc. it makes great stuff we all know it. its products are sleek cool easy to use easy to troubleshoot and have solved many real world problems. the stores are fabulous the customer service there has always been top notch things are explained very clearly and theyve leveraged the notion of free help at the genius bar into just another reason to sell you something. apples brand of laptops and desktops are infinitely preferable to clunky pcs. if something goes wrong with a pc forget it. itll take forever to fix it. with a mac you can usually figure out the problem quickly. the top 00NUMBER00 sp 00NUMBER00 dividend stocks to buy nowfrom a financial standpoint apple stock is on top of the world. in 00NUMBER00 apple stock had a revenue increase of 00NUMBER00 billion thats just the increase   which was almost 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion. thats more than the entire gdp of most nations. the bottom line the actual net income that ignores stuff like stock repurchases also increased 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billion. free cash flow 00NUMBER00 billion i mean these numbers are absolutely mind boggling. apple also has 00NUMBER00 billion in net cash and investments. it trades at 00NUMBER00 times earnings and if you back out its net cash of 00NUMBER00 per share that ratio comes down to about 00NUMBER00 times earnings. here it comes. the stuff i had not considered. i sure love my iphone but i didnt realize that that product accounts for two thirds of apples revenue what how did that happen i thought this was a diversified company wrong. not only that it hasnt updated the iphone for awhile so its first quarter may not be so terrific. apple inc. aapl 00NUMBER00 earnings previewthat means apple had better come up with some neat o new products and do so in the near future. now i love cash. i love it when a company has lots of cash. except i just realized that 00NUMBER00 of its 00NUMBER00 billion or so in cash is not in the united states. because our legislators have seen fit to keep our 00NUMBER00 corporate tax rate apple and others have put cash generated overseas into an overseas mattress. if that money comes back in to the u. s. uncle sam will pocket something like 00NUMBER00 billion. thats not the end of the world since itll still have tons of cash and on a valuation basis apple still only comes in 00NUMBER00 times per share earnings for 00NUMBER00. with analysts looking at 00NUMBER00 annualized growth plus about 00NUMBER00 yield plus 00NUMBER00 premiums i award for world class brands tons of free cash flow and lots of cash i cant object to paying as much as 00NUMBER00 times earnings for apple. i would then reduce it to something like 00NUMBER00 times based on its non diversified revenue stream. which still makes it a buy. so maybe things arent so gloomy after all. tesla motors inc 00NUMBER00 reasons to love tslawhat you need to know before you buy these blue chipsthe post apple inc aapl slowdown or not apple stock is seriously undervalued  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  investorplace investorplace  stock market news stock advice trading tipsits no secret that the chinese consumer market is one of the largest untapped potential revenue streams in the world and countless u. s. companies have strived to gain entry. apple inc. aapl    hasnt been a complete exception although the tech behemoth has had far fewer problems than other american corporations. that was anyway until earlier this month when chinese regulators forced the shutdown of apples ibooks store and itunes movies services. for apple china is its second largest market behind the u. s. with iphone sales in the country beginning to slow revenue from the region will become even more dependent on the ios app store. the future appeared bright considering that in the march quarter revenues from the chinese ios app store surpassed japan for the first time showing them on a course to eventually top the u. s. however with this months moratorium on apples sale of digital books and movies some investors are concerned about not only the current quarters overall revenue expectations but the stability of aapls historically secure operations in china. 00NUMBER00 mega cap tech stocks at the brink of implodingthe question then is if the ban isnt lifted any time soon how much of a negative impact will that have on both revenue and the price of  apple stock  simply put both the short and long term damage to apple stock will depend entirely on how long chinese regulators maintain the ban on aapls digital content. according to  the new york times   to a degree more than many tech companies apple relies on the smooth operation of its software including its app store and services like itunes which are tightly integrated with the iphone and ipad to keep customers coming back to its devices. the various facets of the apple ecosystem which include the app store and related digital goods platforms such as ibooks store and itunes movies have been intentionally linked as tightly as possible to one another. this makes apples ecosystem hard to leave. even if a large number of chinese consumers are buying an iphone for the status and the cachet of owning an apple product  any hindrance to the accessibility and operation of the app store will surely hurt aapls earnings. over the past three fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively   of aapls overall revenue growth has been attributed to china. so considering that trend even the smallest challenge to apples ability to continue smooth operations could be a significant detriment. forresters frank gillett mused is this the beginning of more pressure on apple by the chinese government either way for many investors this months ban is a symbolic turn and the question is to what extent is it a harbinger. the effect of this is you are going to see a more fragmented global internet system where china asserts control over an alternate internet that is at odds with the western ideas of free flow of information said samm sacks   a china analyst at eurasia group. citing an obvious cliche only time will tell. the faster apple management remedies the situation with chinese regulators the faster it can reopen the ibooks store and itunes movies services. theres no telling what restrictions the state administration of press publication radio film and television will place on apple and to what extent if any such restrictions might impact future revenue. according to reuters   wall street expects adjusted earnings per share to drop 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 and revenue to drop 00NUMBER00 percent to 00NUMBER00. apple inc aapl slowdown or not apple stock is seriously undervaluedlast months initiation of a host of new rules regarding virtually all types of internet content in china demonstrate the countrys continued and increasing insistence on censoring its citizens access to content deemed undesirable by regulators. clearly nobody is above the law or exempt from those rules including aapl. theres no doubt that apple management will rectify the situation however possible and as soon as possible but to what extent the app store and related digital goods sales platforms must be censored is yet unknown. in the meantime aapl stock could suffer short term quarterly losses but ultimately this situation shouldnt amount to much more than a temporary setback. as of this

expected to be released this year and moving straight to the iphone 00NUMBER00 next year would disrupt the companys current release schedule which sees it releasing an s version of its current

the greater china region. based on revenue china is apples second largest market behind the americas. apple has been able to maneuver well in the region over the years and it recently launched apple pay in china  two months ago. recently however apple has hit a bit of a rough patch in china. last week chinese regulators banned some of the companys digital services such as ibooks and itunes movies. the chinese government is known to be reluctant in allowing any outside services that directly compete with the countrys domestic offerings. according to apples latest earnings report sales in china came in at 00NUMBER00 billion for the quarter. this compares to 00NUMBER00 in the previous quarter representing a 00NUMBER00 drop. this is also a 00NUMBER00 fall from the same quarter last year.

surrounding apple was iphone sales and this report finally provided some updated numbers. the quarter covered in todays report did include the release of the iphone se a new model based on an older

sales account for about 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue meaning it is by far the most important category to look at today. coming into today apple had never posted a year over year decline in total iphone sales. according to todays report apples total iphone sales came in at 00NUMBER00 million units down 00NUMBER00 from the 00NUMBER00 million units sold a year ago. revenue wise iphone sales came

quarter. the second quarter results were worse than expected with revenue coming in at just 00NUMBER00 billion a figure down 00NUMBER00 billion from a year prior. apple had previously guided to revenue of between 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion so these results missed the midpoint of the guide. as if these poor results werent already bad enough the company dropped something of a bombshell in terms of guidance. revenue is expected to be in the range of just 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion widely missing a consensus of 00NUMBER00 billion. a year ago apple brought in 00NUMBER00 billion so at the midpoint of this guidance revenue is expected to be down 00NUMBER00 over year an acceleration from the decline seen in the most recent quarter. this is an extremely poor showing from the idevice maker. lets take a closer look at the details. two silver linings    there is no spinning these results theyre quite poor. however there are two silver linings here apple says that in the current quarter it intends to bring down channel inventory by more than 00NUMBER00 billion. first if we add this 00NUMBER00 billion back to the revenue guidance we get an apples to apples revenue figure of 00NUMBER00 billion. this is still down substantially year over year approximately 00NUMBER00 and its still lower than where consensus estimates sat but its not as horrifying as the headline numbers would suggest. the second is that the company seems to be experiencing strong demand for the iphone se management says that its currently supply constrained. perhaps this could be a source of upside in coming quarters once supply comes into balance with demand. none of apples core hardware businesses grew    the most troubling thing from the report is that all  of apples hardware businesses saw double digit year over year declines in the first quarter. iphone revenue down 00NUMBER00 ipad revenue down 00NUMBER00 and mac revenue which has typically been a reliable but relatively unexciting business segment for the company was down 00NUMBER00. apples other products business which includes apple watch saw a 00NUMBER00 year over year boost though how sustainable this will be is up for debate and its services business was 00NUMBER00. unfortunately for apple these businesses arent anywhere near large enough to offset the declines in its core hardware businesses. im staying away from this stock    as of writing apple shares are down 00NUMBER00 in the after hours session. the street appears to have been expecting weak results but both the fiscal second quarter miss and the very substantial fiscal third quarter guidance miss arent to be taken lightly. though apple ceo tim cook repeatedly expressed his long term confidence in apples business its product pipeline and the smartphone market as a whole i dont think that investors should buy this on blind faith. the high end of the smartphone market is proving to be a challenging place to be and despite the apparent share gains that apple seems to be seeing cook claimed that the number of switchers from android was the highest in the first half of apples fiscal 00NUMBER00 than in any other six month period apples business is still declining. apples best hope is to put out an incredibly strong 00NUMBER00 later this year but even if it does this is hardly a guarantee that the company will see a snap back in iphone sales in the coming fiscal year. i will be staying on the sidelines for now as i believe there is likely downside from even the current levels seen in after hours trading and not much in the way of a potential catalyst for the next five months or so. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when

apple. apple  reported earnings for the quarter ended in march meaning the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 for the company on tuesday april 00NUMBER00. investors reacted with pessimism to the announcement and  apple stock  was falling by a staggering 00NUMBER00 after the closing bell on tuesday. the market tends to overreact to negative news in the short term but the fact remains that apple is delivering disappointing sales numbers and thats an important reason for concern. disappointing sales    total revenue during the quarter came in at 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 decline from the same period in the prior year. management guidance was for sales in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 so even if revenue was within the companys guidance sales still came in near the low end of the range. iphone revenue totaled 00NUMBER00 billion during the quarter representing 00NUMBER00 of total sales. unit sales fell 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 million while sales in dollar terms declined 00NUMBER00. the average selling price in the iphone segment declined to 00NUMBER00 versus 00NUMBER00 in the previous quarter which is probably related to the fact that the new iphone se sells for lower prices than previous iphone models. looking at the other business segments revenue was as weak as expected in the ipad and mac divisions while other services and products delivered a more encouraging performance. revenue in the ipad division was 00NUMBER00 billion declining by 00NUMBER00 versus the same quarter in the prior year. sales of mac products amounted to 00NUMBER00 billion a 00NUMBER00 decrease. the services division which includes revenue from internet services applecare apple pay and licensing saw 00NUMBER00 increase in revenue reaching 00NUMBER00 billion. interestingly this segment is now considerably bigger than both mac and ipad. the other products segment covers apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and third party accessories. this division produced 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue a 00NUMBER00 annual increase. from a geographical perspective performance in china the second biggest market for apple behind north america was particularly worrisome. apple made 00NUMBER00 billion in greater china sales last quarter representing 00NUMBER00 of total revenue and declining by a steep 00NUMBER00 year over year. this was the first time apple reported declining revenues 00NUMBER00 years and it was also the first quarter with declining iphone sales since the product was introduced in 00NUMBER00. even worse management is expecting continued weakness in the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. guidance is for sales in the range 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion a decline of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 in the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. raising cash distributions    gross margin was 00NUMBER00 of sales during the quarter a modest decline versus 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. operating income fell from 00NUMBER00 billion to almost 00NUMBER00 billion. this drop caused a contraction in earnings per share from 00NUMBER00 per unit in the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share last quarter. the business is still producing healthy cash flows and management increased the size of the capital distribution program. apple produced 00NUMBER00 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and the company returned nearly 00NUMBER00 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. from the inception of its capital return program in august 00NUMBER00 through 00NUMBER00 apple has returned over 00NUMBER00 billion to shareholders including 00NUMBER00 billion in share repurchases. as part of its new capital distribution program apple increased the size of its share repurchase authorization 00NUMBER00 billion announced last year to 00NUMBER00 billion. in addition the company raised dividends by 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share. apple ended the quarter with a massive cash hoard of 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and liquid investments. most of that money is held overseas though and repatriating it would mean a huge tax burden for the company. for this reason apple said in the press release that the company will probably resort to debt to finance its enlarged capital distribution program going forward. apple is doing the right thing by rewarding investors for their patience with growing dividends and buybacks. however the companys ability to generate sustained sales growth going forward is a major concern which will probably weigh on the stock over the middle term. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to

llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  often when a high profile company particularly one with a history of success such as apple aapl has a bad quarter and the stock gets hit it presents a contrarian opportunity. markets tend to overreact to news and once the immediate shock of the news fades the stock will usually recover most of the lost ground. at that point the long term fundamental value of the company becomes the driver of price and quarterly fluctuations in performance seem less relevant. sometimes however the initial losses can mark the beginning of a longer term decline in the stock. so in the case of apple which is itthe answer is that it is a bit of both. aapl will most likely continue to fall over the next few weeks but still represents fundamental value and will prove a good long term holding for those who buy into the expected drop. make no mistake yesterday’s earnings were not pretty. for the first time in thirteen years apple reported a year on year decline in revenue driven mostly by lower iphone sales. that is bad enough but the relative failure in the strategically important chinese market is what will worry most analysts. they had expected an overall revenue decline but most were looking for signs of offsetting growth there. going into this release of forty eight analysts tracked by thompsonfirst call thirty eight had either a “buy” or “strong buy” rating on aapl with only one “sell” recommendation. it is that virtual unanimity that makes waiting for a while the best course for long term value investors. as these numbers are digested and plugged into prediction models it is easy to see a rash of downgrades and reduced price targets over the next few weeks. it has been a feature of apple coverage that seemingly more than any other stock analysts have almost as a unanimous group swung from over optimism to over pessimism and back again in the past. it would be crazy for potential investors to stand in the way as that particular herd changes direction. once the dust has settled however what will be left in the wake of the herd of bulls turned bears will be what apple has been for some time a drastically undervalued company. yes i understand that negative growth is not a good thing even if it has only been one quarter. what is different in this case however is that the stock has been priced in expectation of a sales decline for quite a while. after well over a decade of spectacular growth apple is seen as a growth stock but with a decent 00NUMBER00 dividend yield and having achieved market dominance it is probably better evaluated from a value perspective. even before today’s big drop aapl was trading at around 00NUMBER00 trailing twelve month earnings a discount of over 00NUMBER00 percent on the sp 00NUMBER00 average pe of around 00NUMBER00. to some extent the 00NUMBER00 earnings justify that discount but further drastic falls are needed before it is fully accounted for. what apple is lacking is a new product with a wow factor that drives growth. there have been such fallow periods in the past though and betting against their ability to come up with another such product flies in the face of history. even without that possibility there are signs in even this bad report that further growth can be achieved. the 00NUMBER00 growth in india is a good sign and while china was disappointing that does still leave room for expansion. over the next few weeks analysts who judge apple as a growth stock will no doubt temper their previous enthusiasm. based on past behavior that could well turn into a race to see who can cut the most and further declines in the stock will follow when that happens. at that point though investors with an eye for value will have an opportunity to pick up aapl at a bargain price. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. it never a question of if   but rather how much. as expected apple  has reported its first ever decline in iphone unit sales. the mac maker sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones last quarter down 00NUMBER00 from a year ago. that helped drive total revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion which in turn translated into net income of 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 per share. the company also expanded its capital return program by 00NUMBER00 billion of which 00NUMBER00 billion is being set aside for the share repurchase authorization. at long last macroeconomic challenges that other companies have been struggling with are now taking their toll on apple. heres whats happening behind the headlines. iphone slows    simply put 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 upgrade cycle was massive so massive that it spanned two quarters as apple was so supply constrained that a lot of those sales shifted to the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. theres no way that apple could have topped that cycle and it didnt. ceo tim cook acknowledged that the 00NUMBER00 has been smaller than the 00NUMBER00 cycle but larger than the 00NUMBER00. there was a particularly large sequential decline in average selling prices from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. this decline was largely a function of continued currency impacts and the product mix shifting toward mid tier and entry level offerings. note that the 00NUMBER00 iphone se was launched after the fiscal quarter closed so it had no impact on asps. . . yet more on this later. data source sec filings. fiscal quarters shown. cook emphasized that the three sources of iphone customers  upgrades switchers and first timers remain strong. apple has a 00NUMBER00 customer loyalty rate for upgrades android switchers are trending higher and switching rates are at all time highs global smartphone penetration is still just 00NUMBER00 targeting first time buyers in emerging markets remains remarkably important. ipad and mac    ipad sales continue to decline but apple expects the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro to strengthen the business and its june guidance includes the strongest expected revenue performance for ipad in years. replacement cycles are simply longer in the tablet market and apple isnt too worried since the ipad still enjoys strong satisfaction and usage statistics. apple 00NUMBER00 million ipads during the quarter. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million macs in the fiscal second quarter 00NUMBER00. thats worse than the third party estimates from idc and gartner that were put out a few weeks ago and more notably  worse than the broader markets decline. that suggests that apple failed to gain market share which it has done virtually every quarter for nearly a decade. part of the figures included a reduction in mac channel inventory though likely related to the recent macbook refresh. apple noted that 00NUMBER00 of mac customers in china are first time mac users. say hello to a new non gaap services metric    apple talked quite a bit about services on the january call but the company is talking about services even more now. specifically apple is introducing another non gaap metric for investors to digest installed base related purchases. the idea is to look at how much apple customers spend on digital content and services because this is an indicator of engagement and additional monetization opportunities. the tricky part is that apple has always accounted for different types of content in different ways. apple music is an important component of gaap services revenue. image source apple. things like itunes purchases have always been accounted for on a wholesale basis where apple recognizes the gross billed amount despite the fact that it pays out licensing fees to record labels as part of its costs. things like apps have always been accounted for on a net basis where apple only recognizes its cut the infamous 00NUMBER00 while the developers cut bypasses the income statement. this new installed base related purchases metric adjusts all purchases to be reported on a gross basis and totaled 00NUMBER00 last quarter up 00NUMBER00. apple is very consciously aiming to shift investor attention to recurring revenue sources trying to prove to investors that it is not completely reliant on unit growth which still remains important. for the first time services revenue gaap is now greater than ipad or mac revenue. the guidance game    apples outlook also came in below consensus forecasts. 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billiongross 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billionother income expense net and interest 00NUMBER00 milliontax 00NUMBER00 source apple. the company noted that june guidance includes a significant planned reduction in channel inventory which is valued at 00NUMBER00. in comparison last years similar inventory reduction was just 00NUMBER00 million. at the same time the iphone se is expected to weigh on both iphone asps since it starts at 00NUMBER00. furthermore the vast majority of these reductions are being allocated to high end iphones further hurting sell in asps. margins will similarly take a hit and naturally apple will be losing some operating leverage too. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest

suggest that the companys iphone business is in the proverbial dumps there appears to be a lone bright spot the iphone se. introduced in late march and first available for sale shortly thereafter the phone received mostly positive reviews as it packs flagship class hardware into a relatively affordable compact package. though respected kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo characterized demand for the phone as lackluster ceo tim cook indicated that demand for the se is robust and is cruising past the companys original expectations. in other words just as apple did with the predecessor to this device the iphone 00NUMBER00 it underestimated demand. the bad news first    obviously the bad news here is that its going to take time for apple to come into supplydemand balance which means that  in a quarter in which iphone good news is sorely needed fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple will be unable to meet demand for this product. this clearly means that apple will ship fewer iphone ses than it otherwise could have bringing revenue lower than they might otherwise have been. this also means that customers looking to buy a new phone in the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 range who were originally considering an iphone se may opt for a product from a competitor. apple not only loses out on a phone sale but all of the accompanying ecosystemservices revenue that would have otherwise come with it. now if we were talking about a shortage in the sense that one wouldnt get their phone delivered to them in a matter of a few days or a week this wouldnt be an issue. however on apples online store the lead times appear to be around two to three for the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte rose gold iphone se a long time to wait. the good news    with the bad news out of the way lets get to the good news. the impressive demand for the iphone se validates the existence of a fast 00NUMBER00 inch iphone in the companys lineup. if apple is smart it will continue to invest in updating the iphone se lineup. in fact i suspect in the coming product cycle apple will stop using the se moniker which implies a one off product and will refer to it as the iphone 00NUMBER00 mini or something to that effect. the addition of a credible product at this point should help apple gain share particularly in price sensitive emerging markets and ultimately boost iphone unit shipmentsrevenue to higher levels than they otherwise would have been without 00NUMBER00 inch model in the mix. expect an iphone 00NUMBER00 mini next year    in order to keep the year over year comparisons consistent i expect apple to roll out the successor to the iphone se  which ill call the iphone 00NUMBER00 mini in march of next year. i expect this to have an 00NUMBER00 chip an updated display same resolution but improved contrastviewing angles and an improved camera subsystem. i could also see apple taking the opportunity to slim down the device a smidgen in order to give it some visualaesthetic differentiation the design has now been used for three phone generations but nothing dramatic. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. theres this long standing perception in the world of consumer electronics that companies live and die by product cycles and unit volumes. this notion largely comes from a long history of rapid hardware commoditization shifting consumer preferences and a graveyard of fallen titans. even though apple  has demonstrated an incredible resilience to this idea over the past two decades or so the mac maker cant escape the reality of its hardware roots or the prominence of the iphone in its financial results. as iphone unit sales show visible signs of peaking apple has been trying to take control of the narrative for at least two quarters now instead pointing investors to its large and growing services business. as a recurring revenue source services provide a natural cushion for when unit sales decline. thats why apple wants you to look there. look how much digital stuff we sell    apple has now introduced a new non gaap operating metric for this express reason. installed base related purchases indicates the gross amount of content and services that apple users purchase. an adjustment is necessary since some content and services are reported on a net basis while others are reported on a gross basis. installed base related purchases added up to 00NUMBER00 billion last quarter up 00NUMBER00 year over year. that includes 00NUMBER00 billion in gaap services revenue in addition to 00NUMBER00 billion unrecognized services purchases amounts that are directly remitted to developers or content creators. but lets combine that data point with the fact that apple now has over 00NUMBER00 billion active devices a milestone it announced in january. it adds up    if you divide it out that suggests that users are spending just under 00NUMBER00 per quarter per device. devices included in the installed base total are iphones ipads macs ipod touches apple tvs and apple watches that have been used in the past 00NUMBER00. but thanks to strong halo and ecosystem effects most apple users typically have more than one device. so on a per user basis any given customer could potentially be spending anywhere from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per quarter on digital content and services. if we knew how many active itunes accounts there are these days we could get a better approximation of user spend but its been two years since apple provided data on this. the last update was 00NUMBER00 million active itunes accounts in 00NUMBER00. the tables are turning    this is one reason why apple music is so important. at 00NUMBER00 per month 00NUMBER00 per month for families it represents significant upside potential with monetizing services. on the conference call management noted that music revenue had been in a steady decline for many quarters as the market shifted toward streaming models. as apple adopted streaming music revenue has stabilized and may have now reached an inflection point. apple now has 00NUMBER00 million apple music subscribers which is a good start but theres plenty of work to do and the streaming market is only getting more competitive over time. apple as a service   its already very likely that most investors are undervaluing apples services business   which would be worth an estimated 00NUMBER00 billion alone if the market assigned it a valuation multiple comparable with alphabet. certainly apples valuation has always been more comparable to hardware companies so shifting the perception toward that of a services company could potentially help with its overall multiples. when asked whether or not investors should consider services as an important driver for earnings growth going forward ceo tim cook naturally pointed to apples overarching driving force of making great products and consumer experiences. the growing services business is merely an offshoot

reporting its earnings yesterday   apples aapl  market capitalization has dropped by about 00NUMBER00 billion. for the first time in 00NUMBER00 years the company posted a year over year decline in quarterly revenue. since 00NUMBER00 the cupertino tech giants growth momentum has slowed down dramatically. revenues declined by 00NUMBER00 compared to the same quarter last year and this was primarily driven by the slowdown in iphone sales. quarterly revenues from the smart phone declined 00NUMBER00. this took a big bite out of apple since iphone sales consistently account for more than half of the companys revenues. in 00NUMBER00 iphones were responsible for 00NUMBER00 of the companys sales. as a result of the revenues decline and weak projections for the next quarter apples share price has dropped by about 00NUMBER00. what does this mean for apples valuation right now  lets glance at some key valuation metrics to see how cheap apples stock looks right now. apple trades at a forward pe of just 00NUMBER00 which is far less than the average pe for companies within the sp 00NUMBER00. the company has an evebitda and price to sales of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. an evebitda below 00NUMBER00 is generally considered to be good. apple is known for its strong cash flows and it generates cash flows per share of 00NUMBER00. apple is valued at a price to book of 00NUMBER00 and it also maintains a healthy capital structure having a debt to equity of 00NUMBER00. apple has been buying back over 00NUMBER00 in shares each year since 00NUMBER00 which suggests that the company is betting on its own success. the corporation previously doled out a 00NUMBER00 dividend per share which yields 00NUMBER00. at the earnings release however apple announced a 00NUMBER00 raise to its quarterly dividend. apples strong cash flows suggest that it could easily afford to raise its dividend even more if it wanted to. the company has been raising its dividend annually since 00NUMBER00. bottom lineapple does have a lot of growth hurdles to overcome but it still looks like a bargain across several valuation metrics. the tech giant gets a grade of a for value in our style scores. if the companys cash flows werent so strong and it didnt look like a company that could increase its dividend over time it would be harder to pose a bullish argument for aapl stock. that being said apple will need to find a new growth driver if it wants investors to have the confidence they need to buy the companys shares at higher valuation multiples. apple is a zacks rank 00NUMBER00 hold. the zacks

millions upon millions of iphones. were now approaching the 00NUMBER00 birthday of apple  s world changing iphone which launched in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. for a product thats flirting with double digit age apple has moved an incredible number of units since the smartphones inception. you may not realize it but the mac maker is on the threshold of hitting a massive milestone for its flagship smartphone. in a matter of months apple will sell its billionth iphone. almost to 00NUMBER00 digit territory    as part of its relatively lackluster earnings release  last night apple reported just over 00NUMBER00 million in iphone units sold during the first quarter. that brings apples cumulative lifetime total iphone unit sales to a whopping 00NUMBER00 million through the end of march. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. so apple only needs to sell a little over 00NUMBER00 million more iphones before it gets to 00NUMBER00 digit territory with the handset. apples guidance for the june quarter calls for continued declines in iphone unit sales. for reference the company 00NUMBER00 million iphones  in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. but there should be little doubt that apple can get to 00NUMBER00 billion over the next couple of quarters even if unit volumes are trending lower as we reach the tail end of the 00NUMBER00. plus the iphone 00NUMBER00 is due out in the fall and years with redesigns tend to spur larger upgrade cycles. the latest and greatest iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. hitting 00NUMBER00 billion unit sales for any product is no easy task and there arent very many consumer electronics products that have successfully reached that threshold. apple said in january 00NUMBER00 that it hit 00NUMBER00 billion ios devices sold which includes ipads and

inch ipad pro. image source apple. ive long been a big fan of apple  s share repurchase program largely due to the fact that its simply enormous. by virtue of its magnitude combined with apples cheap valuation the buyback program is mostly able to avoid the common criticisms that typically surround repurchase programs most are not accretive andor poorly timed. the buyback program was a no brainer during the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and apple was able to retire a boatload of shares as it repurchased during that time frame. thats precisely why apple added a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion to its repurchase authorization in early 00NUMBER00. but once shares inevitably recovered to highs around 00NUMBER00 and even with todays prices of around 00NUMBER00 its not as clear cut. even as the valuation remains cheap its not entirely obvious whether or not  the broader market will ever assign apple higher multiples. as such it seems appropriate that apples buyback program while still going strong is starting to cool off a little bit. time to play it slow    alongside fiscal second quarter earnings apple said that it was again expanding its capital return program as expected since its about that time of year. the company is adding 00NUMBER00 to the program bringing the total to 00NUMBER00 billion. of that increase 00NUMBER00 billion is being allocated to share repurchases with the remaining 00NUMBER00 billion to cover dividend payouts over the next couple of years. apple is still focusing its capital return strategy on repurchases which is the right call since thats how it can ensure that the program is accretive. the reason i say that the buyback program is cooling off is that while 00NUMBER00 billion is still a meaningful increase its a relatively more conservative increase than last years boost which was 00NUMBER00 billion. heres each years respective increase in repurchase authorization. yearincreasetotal 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00

figure when you think about it. thats greater than the entire market caps of tech companies 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billion and texas 00NUMBER00 billion. the level of apples increases also signal the companys intentions over the next year. apple will have a little over 00NUMBER00 billion left on the authorization until its next capital return update which comes every april. that should be plenty considering the fact that apple has repurchased about 00NUMBER00 billion over the past four quarters. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

00NUMBER00 with the stock trading below 00NUMBER00. heres why the street was selling off  apple stock  on wednesday and why the market may be overreacting. investors wonder can apple continue to grow    the most likely reason for bearish sentiment toward apple stock on wednesday is its worse than expected revenue decline both for the current quarter and the implied decline factored into guidance for 00NUMBER00. apple reported second quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. this was below analysts estimates for revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion and at the low end of the tech giants guidance for the quarter of revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. making matters worse the company guided for third quarter revenue 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion a range well below analysts consensus estimate for 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue for the quarter. the reported revenue for the quarter that just ended and the companys guidance for the current quarters revenue both imply a significant year over year decline. for 00NUMBER00 apples revenue was down 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter and the midpoint of the companys 00NUMBER00 revenue guidance implies an even worse 00NUMBER00 year over year decline. the overarching concern is that apple will struggle to grow its sales beyond current levels. iphone sales which largely drive the companys total revenue are particularly a concern. with iphone accounting for 00NUMBER00 of the companys total 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 year over year decline in iphone unit sales may have some investors wondering if apples blockbuster iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle was the important devices peak in terms of annual sales. if iphone sales plateau or even worse continue to decline apple may struggle to grow its business. iphone. image source apple. but its not just iphone that may be raising concerns about the companys growth prospects from here. apples ipad and mac segments also saw declining unit shipments on a year over year basis in the companys second quarter. ipad and mac unit sales were down 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter respectively. together these two segments account for 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue. reasons not to worry   despite the companys obvious near term growth challenges the markets sell off of apple stock on wednesday isnt necessarily justified. here are three reasons why the market may be overreacting. 00NUMBER00. apples 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle was extraordinary. taking advantage of pent up demand for iphones with larger displays the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch was a wild success. its success however makes iphone sales comparisons in 00NUMBER00 difficult. for perspective if you compare apples 00NUMBER00 iphone sales to iphone sales in the same quarter two years ago iphone sales are up 00NUMBER00. the companys iphone segment therefore is still performing exceptionally well just not as well as it was last year. apple watch. image source apple. 00NUMBER00. apples services and other products segments look promising. the tech giants services and other products segments which together account for 00NUMBER00 of the companys total revenue were up 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. while these segments year over year growth rates are bound to see volatility on a quarter to quarter basis theyre likely to continue to grow over the long haul driven by the companys loyal installed base and apple watch apple watch revenue falls under apples other products segment. 00NUMBER00. growth isnt priced into the stock. apple trades at just over 00NUMBER00 times earnings. this conservative valuation essentially prices in zero growth. in other words apple could live up to this valuation by maintaining current levels of profitability and continuing to repurchase shares with its hefty free cash flow. when it comes down to it the reasons the street sold off apple stock on wednesday are clear but the reasons to continue holding the stock even amid the markets knee jerk reaction are just as well defined. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

results seen a year prior. the ipad and indeed the tablet market at large is being squeezed by thin and light personal computers on one side and by large screen smartphones on the other. now in a bid to assuage investor fears around this product category apple ceo tim cook told investors that the company expects to enjoy the best ipad revenue compare in over two years. this may seem as though cook is signaling a fundamental improvement in the ipad business but its simply sleight of hand. allow me to explain. ipad pro 00NUMBER00 inch revenue ramping up in 00NUMBER00 indicated that it didnt recognize any sales revenue in fiscal 00NUMBER00 for the iphone se which launched on march 00NUMBER00 and began shipping to customers on march 00NUMBER00 with initial shipments recognized in fiscal 00NUMBER00. the ipad pro launched at the same time so revenues for that product probably werent recognized in fiscal 00NUMBER00 either. that means the initial surge of 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro sales will make a financial impact in fiscal 00NUMBER00. how this makes the year over year comparison worthless    in the year ago quarter 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple didnt launch any new ipad products. indeed in the same quarter 00NUMBER00 apple was well past the october 00NUMBER00 launch of the ipad air 00NUMBER00 and ipad mini 00NUMBER00. so apple is comparing a seasonally peak ipad quarter with a mid product cycle quarter from a year ago. to further fuel the fire apple will surely benefit from having the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro sell at higher prices than the previous generation ipad air 00NUMBER00 products that were available for sale in the year prior. and of course apple should benefit from the fresh price reductions on the ipad air 00NUMBER00 which could help drive incremental volume in the quarter. yes next quarter should be as good as it gets from a year over year comparison perspective but thats much more a reflection of product launch timing dynamics than of fundamental demand trends. apple still has a question to answer    apple has to find a way to get ipad sales to grow again on an apples to apples basis. its not clear how the company will be able to achieve this goal particularly given that at least with ipad the company doesnt have any real obvious product issues. the ipad is far and away the  best  tablet on the market in my view sporting state of the art hardware a large selection of apps tailored for the ipad and an excellent operating system. the problem is that people just arent buying tablets like they used to. perhaps apple can introduce some fundamental game changing innovations that will make the ipad a must have but even if it does those features will shortly find their way into the iphone the product category that apple cares about the most and rightfully so. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering

market news stock advice trading tipsskepticism is something that we hear about often in the market. more importantly we feel it deep in our core. it is usually entwined with disbelief that a current trend can continue given a specific set of concerning factors. its also the reason that investing can be so frustrating to those who try to fit logical arguments into a psychologically driven system. let me know if you have heard or internalized any of these arguments latelyim skeptical of the major indices making new highs in the face of mixed economic data. im skeptical of the bank stocks not

skeptical that  oil prices  can keep driving gains in stocks. im skeptical that rising commodity prices will actually fuel meaningful inflation. the simple fact of the matter is that there is always something to be worried about no matter how the market is performing. your 00NUMBER00 retirement spring cleaning checklistwhen stocks are falling it seems like the narratives always seem to make sense because its usually accompanied by negative headlines and worries over bear markets or recessions. conversely when the market is on the upswing its usually viewed as a much slower transformation to convert the masses to a sense of enthusiasm. thats because when everyone is finally excited about the fundamentals and technical price action lining up to their bullish thesis the end is near. put it this way if you are still skeptical about this market rally then its probably a good thing. there are more than likely other investors on the same wavelength who are also reticent about putting money to work and want to wait and see how this unfolds. earlier this year i wrote about how its never a perfect time to invest in stocks. that was roughly a week before the february low. that timing was purely coincidental but illustrates that when things seem the worst its usually a sign that we are nearing an inflection point. 00NUMBER00 dividend stocks with hidden yields you need to owni find myself getting just as caught up in the psychology of investing as everyone else. fear of losses on the way down. fear of missing out on the way up. that is why i temper my urge to buy or sell every little move in the market by making sure the core of our portfolios stay consistent with our goals. furthermore i make incremental changes over time so as not to disrupt the balance risk and correlation that we are striving for. a healthy dose of skepticism is a good thing  when you are evaluating a new investment advisor or strategy. however it can turn into paralysis by analysis when

smartphone market is maturing tablet and pc sales remain weak and the strong dollar is crimping revenue abroad. on tuesday apple reported weak results by apple standards for its second fiscal quarter and provided a rather dismal 00NUMBER00 outlook. however the companys longer term prospects still seem much better than mr. market would have you think. a terrible horrible no good quarter    for 00NUMBER00 apple reported 00NUMBER00 billion of revenue and a gross margin of 00NUMBER00. while apples gross margin performance was pretty good revenue was near the bottom of its 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 guidance range and down 00NUMBER00 year over year. as a result earnings per share came in at 00NUMBER00 missing the average analyst estimate by 00NUMBER00. apple reported double digit unit sales declines for all three major product lines. image source apple. looking across apples various product lines there wasnt much good news. apple recorded double digit unit sales declines for the iphone ipad and mac product lines. the highlight of the quarterly result was 00NUMBER00 year over year growth in apples services revenue. apples other products category also grew rapidly but that was because the apple watch wasnt on sale during the corresponding period in 00NUMBER00. to make matters worse apple projected another big sales decline for the current quarter. apple forecast revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion down from 00NUMBER00 billion a year ago. it also expects gross margin to shrink to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00. this guidance implies that eps could plummet about 00NUMBER00 year over year. to be fair there are some unusual items in apples guidance. the company plans to reduce channel inventory by about 00NUMBER00 billion this quarter compared to a reduction of less than 00NUMBER00 million in the year ago period. iphone se supply is also constrained at the moment. still these factors only account for a portion of apples guidance shortfall. the slowdown is temporary    as bad as apples second quarter results and third quarter guidance were they arent that big a deal for long term investors. the key iphone business tends to run on a two year cycle   and we are nearing the end of one of those cycles. apple is expected to launch the iphone 00NUMBER00 in september. in recent months a number of supply chain leaks and analyst reports have suggested that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus may not have any game changing features relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. as a result most analysts arent expecting much of a bounce back in iphone sales next year. however its worth remembering that the people most likely to upgrade their phones during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle already bought their phones a year or two ago. by upgrading to the iphone 00NUMBER00 they will be getting two or three years worth of technological improvements not just the new features introduced this fall. iphone replacement demand is likely to rebound this fall. image source apple. furthermore apple ceo tim cook noted on apples earnings call this week that the iphone user base has expanded by a stunning 00NUMBER00 in the past two years. thus even if the upgrade rate is a good deal lower than it was for the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle the total number of users upgrading iphones next year will probably be higher. meanwhile apple continues to attract plenty of new users to its platform both first time smartphone buyers and switchers from other platforms. the combination of more upgrades and steady sales to first time iphone buyers could drive a big jump in iphone sales in fiscal 00NUMBER00. plenty of runway left    perhaps apple will eventually run out of ways to spur iphone upgrades leading to a long slump like the ipad has experienced. however thats not likely to occur for quite some time. in contrast to analysts modest expectations for the 00NUMBER00 analysts are starting to predict a bigger bolder upgrade  for the following year. longer term apple could incorporate virtual reality technology into the iphone. longer lasting batteries are another key improvement that many iphone users are hoping for. in short apple should be able to come up with enough improvements to keep most iphone users upgrading every 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 or annually for the most rabid fans for many years to come. this represents a massive recurring revenue stream that will grow as the iphone user base expands. thats reason enough for apple investors to stick around or even double down. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple   aapl   is a stock that cant be out of news and the latest news is not very positive for shareholders at least in the near term. apple reported a decline in sales for the first time in years with sales declining by. 00NUMBER00 on a year over year basis to 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00. this article discusses if apple is worth holding or buying after the disappointing set of results. the first point that i want to mention is that the stock is certain to react negatively in the very near term as investors digest results that were not in sync with analyst estimates. however this near term trend is unlikely to be the deciding factor and there are other factors that will play a role in determining the stock direction. apple is not currently trading at expensive valuations. the stock trades at ttm pe of and forward pe september … 00NUMBER00 of  …. 00NUMBER00. the pe itself suggests that markets dont see apple as a growth stock anymore and i am in complete agreement with this point. if apple witnesses further correction in the coming weeks the stock will be trading at forward a pe valuation that are below double digits and that makes apple attractive. the second point is that apple users will be looking forward to the much anticipated release of iphone 00NUMBER00 and it is entirely likely that iphone sales have been relatively depressed because of that reason. the release of iphone 00NUMBER00 will put into perspective the potential demand for apple phones and the impact of economic headwinds on iphone sales. it also remains to be seen if the lower priced phones help in volume growth in markets like india where apple product sales are on a rise but still not significant as compared to china. the third point that is important to note is that apple currently has dividend payout of. 00NUMBER00 per share which translates into a dividend yield of. 00NUMBER00 at current prices. in my view the dividend payout will continue to increase in the coming years and i increasingly see apple as a quality dividend stock that investors can hold in the portfolio. it is important to again emphasize here that apple is not trading at rich valuations and it underscores the point that market participants increasingly look at apple as a dividend stock than growth stock. further apple will create significant value through share buyback in the coming years. in conclusion apple is likely to witness few bearish days or weeks but i dont see a big drop in the stock and i expect the stock to stabilize and trend higher once the new product pipeline is announced. in the near term the iphone 00NUMBER00 is likely to be the make or break moment for apple as it is an event market participants will be closely watching. hcaix 00NUMBER00 year financial data  the intrinsic value of hcaix  peter lynch chart of hcaix   warning

offered some much needed insight to investors around iphone. in particular cook took the opportunity to go into detail into apples thinking around the iphone business which he characterized as healthy and strong. additionally the executive explained that iphone sales come from three sources customers who upgrade from previous iphone models customers who switch from android and other operating systems and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time. lets take a closer look at what cook had to say. weak upgrade cycle relative to iphone 00NUMBER00 the upgrade portion first cook noted that during the first half of the companys current fiscal year apple saw an upgrade rate for the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle thats slightly higher than what the company saw with the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle but lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that apple saw with iphone 00NUMBER00. though cook declined to give specifics around the exact upgrade rates he did characterize the iphone 00NUMBER00 upgrade rate as a lot lower than the iphone 00NUMBER00 upgrade rate. if we would have the same rate on iphone 00NUMBER00 that we did on iphone 00NUMBER00 it would be time for a huge party cook added. it would be a huge difference. no kidding. perhaps tim cook and the marketing team at apple may want to rethink the notion of s cycles and make big enough changes generation over generation to reaccelerate upgrade cycles. high switcher rate    on a more positive note cook claimed that the company continues to see a very high level of customers switching to iphone from android and other operating systems. he further added that over the last six months apple enjoyed an influx of more switchers from android and other platforms in the first half of this fiscal year than any other six month period ever. i have to wonder though is this a statement about net  android switchers if so why hasnt this apparently significant share gain helped to soften the woes associated with the weaker upgrade activity why are companies like huawei oppo and vivo still growing as apple sees iphone shipments contractstill plenty of potential first time buyers left    although it is commonly believed that the smartphone market has become saturated cook claims that only 00NUMBER00 of the handset market has moved over to smartphones. iphone is still attracting millions of first time smartphone buyers each quarter especially from emerging markets said cook citing 00NUMBER00 year over year growth in iphone sales in the companys most recent quarter. its worth noting though that apples smartphones are quite pricey with even the cheap iphone se starting at 00NUMBER00 the united states it is likely much more expensive in other regions. this may make it tougher for the idevice maker to gain traction in the areas of the world in which smartphones havent already caught on. whats the investment takeaway    cook makes a reasonable argument for why the future may be brighter for iphone than it looks at this moment in time but i dont think investors should take cooks long term view on faith. for example its clear that apple wildly overestimated the demand that it expected to see for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at the beginning of the cycle. additionally according to cook last quarter the fiscal second quarter was expected to be the trough for iphone year over year comparisons something that clearly doesnt seem to be the case given the shockingly poor forward guidance. to me it looks like cook has a lot of very nice sounding excuses but the bottom line is that its core iphone business is currently experiencing sharp year over year declines. this needs to be resolved preferably sooner rather than later before  apple stock  becomes worthy of fresh investment capital again. 00NUMBER00 companies poised to explode when cable dies   cable is dying. and there are 00NUMBER00 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering 00NUMBER00 trillion industry

2016-05-02 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.4592090516985627,0.2500438317792348,-0.0003078211356754,last week apple  reported disappointing quarterly earnings and an even more disappointing outlook. not surprisingly the iphone has gotten a lot of press attention as it logged its first ever year over year sales decline last quarter and apple expects another decline in the current third fiscal quarter. ipad sales have fallen by more than a third since 00NUMBER00. image source apple. however the continuing struggles of apples ipad product lineup are more remarkable. despite significant technological upgrades and the introduction of a new form factor ipad sales are still declining. reaching new lows    of course ipad sales declines are nothing new for apple investors. two years ago i noted the beginnings of a sharp slowdown  in ipad sales. during the 00NUMBER00 calendar year apple sold 00NUMBER00 ipads. by contrast after nine consecutive quarters of year over year declines apple has sold just 00NUMBER00 million ipads over the past four quarters. for a while it was relatively easy to explain away these ipad sales declines. initially ipad sales grew at an explosive rate as the iphones popularity ensured that there were a lot of early adopters. however for one reason or another ipad buyers seem much less interested in upgrading their devices than iphone users. with a significantly longer upgrade cycle   apple wasnt able to keep sales growing after meeting the initial surge of demand for the ipad in the first few years after it launched. half hearted upgrades to apples lineup of 00NUMBER00 inch ipads 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 and the companys decision not to launch a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad last fall also contributed to the sales declines. great new ipads hit the shelves    by late 00NUMBER00 there were tens of millions of ipads that were three to five years old and still getting frequent use. this suggested that all apple needed to do to spark a big upgrade cycle  was to introduce updated models with better performance and new features. apple has delivered. last fall it launched the ipad pro introducing a new 00NUMBER00 inch form factor to the ipad lineup. in addition to being bigger its the most powerful ipad ever and comes with optional accessories like a keyboard attachment and pressure sensitive stylus making the ipad more suitable for productivity tasks. at the same time apple updated its smallest form factor with the ipad mini 00NUMBER00 providing a huge boost in performance  and screen quality in a thinner lighter package. most recently apple began selling a 00NUMBER00 inch version of the ipad pro a month ago replacing the ipad air 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro is nearly as powerful as its larger sibling packs in some extra features and has a starting price that is 00NUMBER00. last month apple introduced a 00NUMBER00 inch version of its powerful ipad pro. image source apple. with three high quality new products spanning the full range of tablet form factors apples ipad should be primed for strong growth. unfortunately the buyers havent showed up. wheres the demand    last quarter ipad sales slumped 00NUMBER00 year over year. and despite the introduction of the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro which starts at 00NUMBER00 the average selling price asp was flat 00NUMBER00 indicating that the vast majority of ipad buyers opted for older discounted ipads. however the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro didnt go on sale until after 00NUMBER00 ended raising the possibility that sales would return to growth in 00NUMBER00. apple cfo luca maestri dashed that hope on the earnings call though. he stated that ipad sales would decline on a sequential basis which also implies that this quarters ipad sales total will be well below the year ago level. cook noted that the rate of year over year decline would be the slowest in many quarters but thats not much of a consolation considering the effort apple has put into updating the ipad lineup. its also worth noting that apple hasnt always seen seasonal sequential declines moving from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. in 00NUMBER00  the last time that apple introduced a new ipad in march ipad unit sales rose 00NUMBER00 on a sequential basis in 00NUMBER00. apple sold more than 00NUMBER00 million ipads that quarter at an asp of 00NUMBER00. by contrast this quarter it apparently expects to sell about 00NUMBER00 ipads at a lower average price. wait and see for now    its still possible that ipad sales will pick up over the course of this year. the holiday season could spur an uptick in sales particularly if apple upgrades one or more of its ipad models this fall. apples push to sell the ipad pro to businesses in partnership with ibm   could also gain momentum in the next few months as corporate it departments have to test new products before rolling them out widely. but if there is still no sign of a sales recovery a year from now apple may have to consider more radical solutions. one possibility is marketing a subsidized trade in program to longtime ipad users in order to stimulate more upgrades. or apple could just cut prices across the board while keeping a closer eye on costs for the ipad program. of course the best solution would be to ignite sales growth through innovation. unfortunately thats something apple has been unable to do for its ipad product line in the last few years. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of

dramatically bolstered its spending on research and development over the past several years no doubt enabled by the companys tremendous revenue growth. interestingly even as the company sees a slowdown in its business as sales are expected to plunge by around 00NUMBER00 year over year in the current quarter  apple continues to increase its research and development spending. indeed in the most recent quarter apple reported that its research and development spending increased from 00NUMBER00 billion in the year ago quarter to a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion. spending on a sequential basis was up around 00NUMBER00 million. lets see what apple executives had to say about these increased investments even in the face of a challenging revenue and demand environment. rd up but discipline in sga    on the call cfo luca maestri pointed out that total operating expenses in apples most recent quarter were only up 00NUMBER00 a figure that he says is the lowest rate that investors have seen in years. diving a little bit deeper into the dynamics around operating expenses maestri pointed to continued significant investments in research and development. these investments the executive said are due to a number of factors. heres maestriwe continue to invest in initiatives ahead of revenue. we have a much broader product portfolio than we used to have. we do much more in house technology development than we used to a few years ago which we think is a great investment for us to make. as far as sales general and administrative spending or sga maestri noted that this figure actually came down year over year. that said the difference between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion is a virtual rounding error at the scale that apple operates. apple wants a competitive expense to revenue ratio but wont starve the biz    maestris message was quite simple apple isnt going to put the brakes on research and development spending because the investments made in that area today will be what deliver revenue tomorrow. apple is however going to continue to try to manage its sga extremely rightly and in a very disciplined way. as you know our expense to revenue ratio is around 00NUMBER00 executive said. its something that were very proud of. its a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry and we want to keep it that way. investors should look forward to what this product pipeline will produce    given the dramatic step up in research and development spending on apples part i am inclined to believe ceo tim cook when he says that hes very excited about whats in apples product pipeline. the worlds greatest technical and creative minds are going to be in high demand and collecting them all under one roof isnt going to be cheap. however given apples tremendous wherewithal to invest in future products its good to see the company take the long view rather than focus solely on short term profits. this fall apple is going to need to put out a dazzling set of products to persuade customers to upgrade their current iphones to next generation models and at the same time continue to bring non iphone users looking to upgrade to new devices into the iphone fold. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

market news stock advice trading tipsapple inc. nasdaq  aapl    shares fell more than 00NUMBER00 last week after a disappointing earnings report  and word from activist investor carl icahn  that he sold his shares in the company scared investors. as a result aapl stock fell to a major multiyear technical line of support and a break below said line could lead to more downside. all last week the financial media debated whether aapl stock has seen its best days. the way i see it apple might have seen the best of its upside trajectory for the coming years but it doesnt mean the stock cant climb higher over time it likely will just at a slower pace. apples arm extends too deep into the smartphone and related ecosystems and aside from new product launches the company still has plenty more areas to capitalize more on particularly in the services segment. from an investor flow perspective i have for about a year heard of large institutional investors reducing their positions in aapl stock last weeks confession by carl icahn merely confirms this trend. however whats more concerning at this juncture is that the majority of the analyst community still has buy ratings on the stock and that the retail community is also uber bullish on the stock. 00NUMBER00 stocks to sell in may and go awayall that could help apple falter further in the near term. looking at the multiyear weekly chart we see that aapl stock has been holding above its 00NUMBER00 week moving average for years but now for the first time shares are visibly weighing on this line in a more serious manner. note that for the past 00NUMBER00 apple has been making a series of lower highs and the horizontal support area marked by the red dotted line is now getting tested a third time since last august. a break and hold below the 00NUMBER00 area through this lens likely targets the low 00NUMBER00. click to enlargeon the daily chart we see that the most recent lower high the reaction high from mid april coincided with the stocks 00NUMBER00 day simple moving average as well as the 00NUMBER00 fibonacci retracement of the move from the november 00NUMBER00 reaction highs down to the february lows. click to

the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source invensense. shares of motion processor specialist invensense  cant seem to get a break. after apple   to which the company is very heavily exposed announced lackluster fiscal second quarter results and issued well below consensus revenue guidance invensense shares predictably began to plunge. the news from apple is no doubt quite bearish for virtually every component supplier with substantial exposure to the iphone. there are some apple suppliers though that im interested in buying on this weakness but invensense isnt one of them. heres why. prospects for content share gains in iphone 00NUMBER00 are unclear    there are a number of iphone component suppliers particularly in the radio frequency chip space that expect to see substantial dollar content share gains in the coming iphone. this means that even if apple isnt able to grow units in the coming product cycle those vendors still have reasonable shots at delivering apple related revenue growth year over year. with invensense its not clear that it will be able to gain significant dollar content at apple. to be sure invensense is actually finding interesting ways to gain content at other smaller smartphone vendors. this content comes in the form of both additional hardware think for example optical image stabilization modules and fingerprint scanners as well as value added software i. e. software development kits to help customers make better use of invensenses motion processor hardware. that said to my knowledge apple does the heavy lifting on the software side to implement invensenses solutions so there likely isnt much of an opportunity for invensense on that front. apple is also unlikely to adopt invensenses fingerprint scanning solution given that apple has significant in house resources there too. optical image stabilization may be an opportunity for content growth in the iphone but at this point this is entirely speculative. apple could conceivably use a more sophisticated motion processing chip in the next iphone models providing a boost to content but there is a risk that apple in a bid to cut costs to make more room for more impactful features could continue to use older invensense motion processing chips. it is worth noting that the iphone 00NUMBER00 appears to use the same invensense motion processing chip as the iphone 00NUMBER00 per ifixit. still not sold on non smartphone opportunities    invensense management has talked about opportunities outside of smartphones in products such as wearables. the companys non smartphone non tablet and non optical image stabilization business came in at around 00NUMBER00 of revenue in the most recent quarter. there is also an argument to be made that the company is diversifying beyond apple for example invensense issued a press release announcing xiaomis use of invensenses icg 00NUMBER00 ois macro sensor. however im not optimistic that if apples business remains relatively weak business from these much smaller customers will be able to fully offset that weakness. staying away for now    invensense stock will become interesting to me whenif there are clear signs that apples iphone business has turned the corner and returned to growth. however it wont be until the first iphone 00NUMBER00 sales numbers are in that investors will have any idea as to whether this is likely to happen. in the meantime i expect invensense stock to be range bound at best and subject to further downside if the news around iphone continues to be poor. for now im sticking to the sidelines. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

marketing divisions at major technology companies are often underappreciated by the general public. these teams arent just there to try to push whatever product the engineering teams have managed to craft but it is their jobs to figure out what customers want to buy. put simply its up to marketing to decide what  the next big thing is and its up to the various hardwareengineering teams to turn that vision into reality. based on the rumors that have hit the web regarding apple  s upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 series of smartphones i am starting to wonder if the companys marketing team is in the process of making a huge mistake. no major industrial design change    apple has spent years trying to convince potential customers that thinner and lighter is the way to go. in fact take this excerpt from apple marketing chief phil schiller from the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch event as irrefutable evidence of this claimso before we get into it this is the monumental challenge the team had can you make a phone that has everything the iphone 00NUMBER00 has before even talking about new features in a design thats thinner lighter and smaller than the previous productit is really easy to make a new product thats bigger everyone does that. thats not the challenge. the challenge is to make it better and smaller. interestingly although apple was able to make the iphone 00NUMBER00 of smartphones thinner than the iphone 00NUMBER00 series though they were much larger overall apple actually had to increase  the thickness and weight of its iphone 00NUMBER00 series of devices. presumably these compromises were done in order to 00NUMBER00 touch functionality. early rumorsleaks around the iphone 00NUMBER00 suggested that it would be substantially thinner than the iphone 00NUMBER00. ming chi kuo with kgi securities for example said that the iphone 00NUMBER00 be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick a significant reduction from the 00NUMBER00 millimeters of the iphone 00NUMBER00. recently however rumors have begun to circulate  that the iphone 00NUMBER00 series devices will have virtually identical dimensions to their iphone 00NUMBER00 counterparts. if true iphone sales and average selling prices could take a hit    if apple is banking solely on internal changes to the iphone 00NUMBER00 the idevice maker may be set to face yet another cycle of year over year declines. the iphone 00NUMBER00 represented a significant internal update to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and yet it wasnt enough to spark a significant upgrade cycle. to make matters worse apple reported a slight degradation in iphone average selling prices in the most recent quarter as a result of very popular mid tier and entry offerings. in other words many iphone buyers likely thought that the 00NUMBER00 series didnt offer much of value over the iphone 00NUMBER00 and ultimately went with the cheaper 00NUMBER00. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 looks virtually identical to the iphone 00NUMBER00 if the iphone 00NUMBER00 sees a price reduction to current iphone 00NUMBER00 once the iphone 00NUMBER00 launches apple could see a further weakening of its product mix. when it comes to smartphones industrial design is critical no doubt due to the fact that apple has spent years hyping up its industrial design and elevating industrial designers like jony ive virtually to rock star status. not changing things up here with iphone 00NUMBER00 would likely be a huge mistake on apples part and shareholders will be the ones who ultimately pay the price. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity

in an interview on cnbc following apples disappointing earnings release   icahn confirmed that he has now sold off all of his shares in the mac maker. icahns position and advocacy had long been a bullish signal for investors and a multibillion dollar vote of confidence. losing icahns investment isnt a good thing but at the same time investors shouldnt worry all that much about it. icahn never understood apple in the first place. its been a good few years    saying apple was too cheap to ignore three years ago about when icahn initiated his position would be the understatement of the century. icahn first disclosed his position on social media in august 00NUMBER00 when shares were trading at 00NUMBER00 split adjusted. this was as apple was recovering from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 pullback which saw shares lose 00NUMBER00 of their value over a matter of months. at the time he called it a no brainer since shares looked incredibly undervalued especially when you factored in the massive cash position. its worth noting that icahn was instrumental in pushing apples aggressive repurchase program over the years so icahns involvement has very much been a positive influence for investors. keep in mind that there were already signs that icahn was losing faith such as when he sold 00NUMBER00 million  shares in the first quarter. icahn noted that his fund made a great deal of money on the trade. its been a good run. but beyond that there were always two flaws with icahns overly bullish thesis. flaw no. 00NUMBER00 assigning apple a market multiple    on a few occasions icahn assigned share valuations that were far above where the market was trading. for instance he even went as far as to call apple shares  half price   based on a valuation of 00NUMBER00 per share in october 00NUMBER00. this was a then current estimate and not a forward looking price target. but the way that icahn arrived at this valuation estimate was by assigning apple a valuation multiple comparable to the broader sp 00NUMBER00 times forward earnings at the time for those keeping score at home. apple has long traded at a substantial discount to the broader market though and theres very little evidence  to suggest that the market is willing to assign it a market multiple. while apple is still driving earnings growth through its highly accretive share repurchase program investors crave top line growth. and even though apple was still growing over the past few years investors could see the writing on the wall in terms of sales growth since apples revenue base had gotten so large. icahn should have never used a market multiple when trying to estimate apples value. flaw no. 00NUMBER00 hoping for an apple tv    somewhat less meaningful was icahns belief that apple would

estimating that apple would sell 00NUMBER00 million units in fiscal 00NUMBER00. by fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple tv was to bring in 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue. unfortunately reports surfaced shortly later that suggested apple had killed off  its ambitious tv project after nearly a decade of research on the idea. an apple tv set has always been a long shot and investors should have never banked on apple launching one. icahn is scared of china    apples exposure to china was a large factor in icahns decision to sell. its true that apples revenue in greater china just fell 00NUMBER00 and the company is finally beginning to feel some effects of a broader macroeconomic slowdown but the business is still quite strong in the middle kingdom. icahn noted that the chinese government has a huge influence on market forces but thats always been true. china has always been marked by heightened geopolitical risk but its such a massive market that its worth navigating. icahn might be bailing but

one year anniversary of the apple watchs sales debut and  the device inspires no shortage of strong opinions among investors and tech enthusiasts. especially in light of apples recent growth struggles   the company needs the apple watch to succeed now more than ever. keeping that in mind lets look at what the apple watch achieved in its first year on the market and what apple investors should expect from the device in the months and years ahead. an undisputed winner   regardless of your opinion on the device one simple fact lies beyond dispute the apple watch has been one of apples fastest selling products ever. no doubt apples current installed base in excess of 00NUMBER00 billion devices presents the apple watch with an inherent built in advantage over previous new products. apple declines to publicly state in its quarterly filings how many watches it has sold. watch sales combine with devices like beats headphones and ipods to form apples other products reporting segment. however analysts estimate apple sold about 00NUMBER00 million watches in its first year on the market which compares quite favorably to past apple products first year salesdata source wall street journal  subscription required. at an assumed price of 00NUMBER00 per unit this implies the apple watch alone generated 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue last year. though that pales in comparison to the sheer enormity of say the iphone that 00NUMBER00 billion in apple watch revenue is more than three times more than fitbit  s total revenue in 00NUMBER00. not without its issues   at the same time the apple watch is by no means a perfect device as its many detractors frequently remark. as the wall street journal  s great tech reporter joanna stern  succinctly put it apples new watch wants to be your all day helper. but the promise doesnt always match reality. she certainly isnt the only reviewer to like but not love the apple watch. thats because the apple watch in many ways serves many of the same uses as the iphone. having quick access to features like push notifications or digital tickets seems genuinely useful but does it justify the expense especially after apple recently reduced iphone prices i can certainly see how some might say no. another aspect of this criticism is that the apple watch doesnt do anything that the iphone or other smartphones cannot unless you think sending beating heart emojis to your friends adds a lot of value. futurists and gadget enthusiasts have long argued that smartwatches can help usher in a new era in biometrics and disease prevention. however given the current difficulties even embedded heart rate sensors encounter in producing accurate results the game changing functionality that many hope for remains rooted in the distant future. this lack of a true killer features means the apple watch will likely remain more of a gadget than a necessity until any major breakthrough reaches market. if you think its cool and you want one youll likely enjoy it. however its overall utility remains far lower than a device like a smartphone as analysts sales expectations also indicate. apple watch outlook   viewing the apple watchs truly impressive short term success only tells one part of its story. to more fully understand the devices likely long term place within apples money printing financial structure we need to also consider what its future might look like with a bit more specificity. for the reasons above and a few more the apple watch should grow into a nice financial segment for apple. at the same time though analysts believe it is unlikely to produce the same kind of financial impact similar to core apple products like the iphone. heres how research firm idc projects apple watchs unit sales will compare to the iphones first six years on the market. sources idc and apple investor relations. this is the critical point for apple investors. yes the apple watch produced impressive results in its first year on the market. however its ceiling is more likely to be that of an ipad than an iphone. this of course is by no means a negative. assuming this same 00NUMBER00 average selling price mentioned above this implies a fresh 00NUMBER00 billion in apple watch revenue by 00NUMBER00. rather it speaks to apples nearly mind bending enormity that 00NUMBER00 billion in sales in six years seems unremarkable. while the apple watch deserves plenty of credit for its impressive first year results investors would do well to focus on higher impact areas of the companys product portfolio. a secret billion dollar stock

first year win but what about the long term  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc. all rights reserved. the motley fool has a  disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. relatively speaking apple  is taking a more conservative  approach to its capital return program update this year. while the 00NUMBER00 billion overall increase is still impressive and far greater than what most companies can afford to commit 00NUMBER00 is greater than many companies entire market caps the expansion is comparatively lower than in prior years. to some extent it makes sense to take a measured approach after having bought back an incredible 00NUMBER00 billion in stock over the past four years. but heres the thing apple simply generates too much cash. too much not too fast    ive noticed this before   but apples cash generation capabilities are so great that even as the company has returned 00NUMBER00 billion in capital to shareholders since 00NUMBER00 including both dividends and share repurchases the iphone maker still  has more cash than when it started the program. by a lot. apple announced the capital return program in march 00NUMBER00 at which time it was sitting on less than 00NUMBER00 billion in total cash 00NUMBER00 billion to be exact. shareholders had been demanding some form of capital return program for years which just wasnt going to fly  under steve jobs watch. it was pretty clear that 00NUMBER00 billion was more than apple needed to run the business and apples generally conservative acquisition strategy also meant it was unlikely to blow that cash on a splashy purchase. yet here we are four years later and apple has given 00NUMBER00 billion but still has more than it needs. at last count apples net cash position was 00NUMBER00 billion or 00NUMBER00 more than what it had when it announced the program. that includes 00NUMBER00 in gross cash and about 00NUMBER00 billion in long term debt. heres how apples net cash position has grown despite the massive debt load. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. it should be clear now why i think apple can afford to be more aggressive with its capital returns. but there are still a few other factors to consider. why not    its also important to look at a companys valuation when evaluating the effectiveness of its share repurchase program. if the company repurchases when prices are too high it risks destroying shareholder value if prices fall and if it was never offsetting dilution from stock based compensation in the first place. considering the magnitude of apples program it is inherently accretive since apple repurchases so many of its shares that it meaningfully reduces shares outstanding. meanwhile the valuation is cheap as has long been the case. its very unlikely that apples repurchases will prove to be badly timed. but the more significant hurdle to increased capital returns is those pesky repatriation taxes. of the 00NUMBER00 billion total nearly 00NUMBER00 billion of apples cash now sits overseas with 00NUMBER00 held domestically. the debt strategy has always been a roundabout way to tap foreign reserves without actually repatriating cash. hopefully that rumored repatriation tax holiday comes to fruition one of these days. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

andor are compared on a year over year basis. the good news is that fools often have a broader view and our track record of beating the market isnt predicated on our ability to construct superior dc models with better estimates of terminal growth rates. its our patience and fortitude that sets us apart. if you look around right now theres an awful lot of pessimism surrounding apple. shares are trading near 00NUMBER00 week lows in the wake of fiscal second quarter results and investors are questioning apples ability to keep growing in china. zoom in    revenue in greater china fell by 00NUMBER00 last quarter. its been nearly three years since apple posted a year over year decline in greater china sales which last occurred in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle last quarter was insane considering the pent up demand and strong local consumer preference for larger smartphones. thats now creating a situation that i like to call a tough compare. ok other people call it that. simply put this is what investors are worried about right nowdata source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. but as ceo tim cook pointed out on the conference call were comparing to the year ago period when sales jumped 00NUMBER00. apples guidance for the june quarter was a bit timid with revenue expected in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion representing a 00NUMBER00 drop at the midpoint. the mac maker doesnt break out guidance by geography but the greater china business is expected to continue contracting. next quarters compare will be even tougher though since it will be going up against the impressive 00NUMBER00 growth that apple posted in greater china for 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. that entire hump in the chart above representing 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 rates over four quarters will be hard to beat in the coming quarters and apple wont. focusing so intently on these short term growth rates while important to acknowledge is the problem. you should zoom out. zoom out    if you look at the longer term trajectory of apples business theres very little cause for concern. on a quarterly basis sales continue to march higher and you can see just how strong of a 00NUMBER00 apple enjoyed in the middle kingdom. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. you may not realize this but apple only really dedicated its efforts to china as recently as 00NUMBER00. the mac maker generated less than 00NUMBER00 million in revenue in greater china fiscal 00NUMBER00. seven years later its a 00NUMBER00 billion business. heres apples greater china business on a trailing 00NUMBER00 month basis which helps smooth out the seasonality. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. cook recently pointed out that five years ago chinas middle class was just 00NUMBER00 million households. five years from now chinas middle class will be 00NUMBER00 million households. thats precisely the opportunity that the company is chasing even if there will be speed bumps along the way. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss

inc.  apple  stock was crushed by a staggering 00NUMBER00 in a single day after the company reported disappointing earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 last week. at current prices shares of the tech juggernaut are down by more than 00NUMBER00 from their highs of the last year. lets look at why this is happening and perhaps more importantly what it could mean for investors going forward. sales are moving in the wrong direction    the biggest reason for the drop to put it simply is that apple reported declining sales. total revenue during the quarter ended in march was 00NUMBER00 billion a 00NUMBER00 decline from the same period in the prior year. that number was near the low end of the companys guidance and also below wall street expectations. adding to the concerns management is expecting revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 which would be a 00NUMBER00 decline over the same period last year at the middle of the range. understandably the prospect for continued weakness in the coming earnings report is putting considerable downward pressure on  apple stock. data in millions of dollars. source sec filings. apple is a victim of its own success    the iphone accounts for 00NUMBER00 of total revenue for apple so it has a huge impact on the overall financial performance. the company is therefore a victim of its own success in this important division. data in thousands of units. source sec filings. the iphone 00NUMBER00 enjoyed booming demand in fiscal 00NUMBER00 as many customers eagerly embraced the new models with larger screen sizes. iphone sales in the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 to a staggering 00NUMBER00 million a 00NUMBER00 increase over the same period in 00NUMBER00. as for the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple sold 00NUMBER00 devices. thats a 00NUMBER00 decline from 00NUMBER00 levels though its still up by 00NUMBER00 from the same quarter in 00NUMBER00. from china with no love    china is apples second biggest market behind north america accounting for 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. in fact china has been a powerful growth engine for the company over the past several quarters. things changed abruptly last quarter though as apple registered a steep 00NUMBER00 revenue decline from the greater china region. data in millions of dollars source sec filings. unfortunately the smartphone market in china is getting saturated. moreover comparisons were already particularly difficult for apple last quarter as china sales in the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 had increased by a massive 00NUMBER00. in addition performance was hurt by channel inventory reductions and currency weakness during the period. its hard to tell what could happen with smartphone demand in china over the coming quarters but apple still has considerable room for expansion in emerging markets if the company plays its cards right. based on data from idc apple has a market share of only 00NUMBER00 on a global scale and that means plenty of opportunity to gain market share in the future. ceo tim cook sounds quite confident about the companys ability to produce sustained growth in emerging markets. in his own words the iphone is still attracting millions of first time smartphone buyers each quarter especially from emerging markets. for example in india our iphone sales were up 00NUMBER00 from a year ago. what this means going forward    the deceleration in growth is real and probably here to stay. chances are that apple wont go back to delivering the kind of explosive performance it was generating when the smartphone industry was going through its initial growth stage. on the other hand current negativity regarding the companys growth potential could be exaggerated and there are strong reasons to believe the sales decline is a transitory phenomenon as opposed to a permanent trend. apple is facing enormously challenging comparisons because of the massive success the iphone 00NUMBER00 produced in fiscal 00NUMBER00 comparisons should get easier over the medium term. even if sales are down from fiscal 00NUMBER00 theyre still up considerably from 00NUMBER00. that should put the numbers in context. so should this the iphone 00NUMBER00 isnt doing as well as the iphone 00NUMBER00 but its selling much better than all other previous models. as long as the company keeps launching solid products 00NUMBER00 and beyond consumers will continue upgrading their iphones over the years and apple still has a lot of room for growth in emerging markets. the most likely scenario is that sales will start growing again in the middle term which should provide considerable upside fuel for apple stock from current price levels.

market intelligence. much of the decline was driven by the companys second quarter report which featured a steep revenue decline weak guidance and the first ever year over year drop in iphone sales. so what  apple reported first quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 year over year and more than 00NUMBER00 billion below the average analyst estimate. iphone unit sales tumbled 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 million while iphone revenue dropped 00NUMBER00 due in part to a decline in average selling price. iphone asp was 00NUMBER00 the second quarter down from 00NUMBER00 during the first quarter. sales of both ipads and macs were also weak during the second quarter. ipad unit sales fell 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 with revenue also slumping 00NUMBER00. meanwhile mac unit sales dropped 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 million driving a 00NUMBER00 revenue decline. apples services business was strong growing revenue by 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billion and sales of other products which include the apple watch jumped 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 billion. apple reported earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share down from 00NUMBER00 share during the prior year period and 00NUMBER00 lower than analyst expectations. lower revenue and higher rd costs led to the earnings decline while share buybacks helped soften the blow on a per share basis. apples diluted share count dropped 00NUMBER00 year over year driven by the companys massive capital return program. apples guidance for the third quarter also left a lot to be desired. the company expects revenue between 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion well below analyst expectations of 00NUMBER00 billion. at the midpoint of that range third quarter revenue would decline by about 00NUMBER00 year over year. now what  investors were expecting a decline in iphone sales during the second quarter but the size of the decline was a surprise. apples guidance calls for the pain to continue and investors will need to wait until the next major iphone launch presumably later this year before it becomes clear whether the iphone growth story is truly over. apple still has a tremendous amount of cash and the companys buyback authorization now sits at a staggering 00NUMBER00. but with iphone ipad and mac sales all declining during the second quarter and with guidance calling for more of the same during the third quarter investors are no longer in love with apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

seen the headlines. apple  s iphone sales were down and guidance for apples fiscal third quarter suggests more of the same this summer. but theres more to the story and much of it was buried in the companys insightful earnings call. apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. the iphone business is healthy    despite market concerns about apples iphone business after the company reported a year over year 00NUMBER00 decline in unit shipments apple ceo tim cook said during the companys first quarter earnings call via a seeking alpha transcript   that management believes the segment is healthy. to provide some additional color iphone sales come from three sources customers who upgrade from previous iphone models customers who switch from android and other operating systems and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time. as we look at each of these three sources of iphone sales we see a business that is healthy and strong. cook went on to note that the upgrade rate for the iphone 00NUMBER00 better than it was for the iphone 00NUMBER00. of course he admitted it was slower than the upgrade rate for iphone 00NUMBER00. but given what a monstrous upgrade cycle the iphone 00NUMBER00 was as iphone buyers embraced iphones with larger displays this is understandable. as far as customers switching from android and other operating systems the company added more switchers in the first half of the year than any other six month period cook said. and cook also noted that iphone is still attracting millions of first time smartphone buyers each quarter especially from emerging markets. iphone sales will return to growth   not only does cook believe the iphone business is healthy but he believes there is more upside left for the device. and were very optimistic that this too shall pass cook responded when asked whether or not the companys iphone sales can return to growth and that the market and particularly us will grow again. again cook cited the companys strong upgrade os switcher and first time buyer rates as reasons to believe the 00NUMBER00 decline is only temporary. and cook was careful to emphasize that the iphone 00NUMBER00 is just downright tough to beat in the meantime. were lower than the iphone 00NUMBER00 but i think all of us know that that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades from 00NUMBER00 into 00NUMBER00. and so that comparable will be tough for this year but thats a transitory thing. for what its worth cooks references to tough year ago comparisons arent cop outs. the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle truly was huge. for instance in the year ago quarter iphone unit sales were up 00NUMBER00 compared to the year before. iphone se. image source apple. iphone se looking good   an important thread that surfaced several times throughout the call was how well the companys march introduced iphone se is doing in the market. iphone se became available on march 00NUMBER00 so none of its sales were reflected in our second quarter results. but so far this quarter were seeing terrific customer response. apples iphone se which is basically the companys latest smartphone technology packed into the iphone 00NUMBER00 body with at an iphone 00NUMBER00 price point marked a significant departure from the companys typical annual introductions of flagship iphones. with the iphone se apple catered to a more affordable price point for the first time with a competitive device. cook even noted that demand for the phone has been so strong that it exceeds supply at this point. while these were some of the most interesting takeaways from the earnings call id recommend all apple investors listen to the full recording. given that apples second quarter earnings followed a rare quarter of declining revenue it comes at a critical time for the company and the insightful tidbits included in the call didnt disappoint. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something

is talking about. the post wednesday apple rumors tim cook hints at major iphone 00NUMBER00 feature  appeared first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and

apple  jumped into music streaming with apple music but the mac maker is already working on a major overhaul to the service following some mixed reviews. according to bloomberg   apple is revamping the interface in an effort to make it easier to use and more intuitive. apple will also broaden its radio service. 00NUMBER00 followed up with additional details regarding the upcoming changes. a redesigned user interface will be simplified and include features like lyrics and larger album artwork. apple is expected to unveil the changes at its wwdc developer conference in june. how un apple    when apple music first launched there were plenty of criticisms around the services usability even from loyal apple journalists and fans like jim dalrymple. since apple chose to integrate apple music into the existing mobile app the company was overly ambitious and stuffed too many features in at the expense of usability. its a tricky balance when a single app manages both subscription streaming as well as previously purchased content. the interface simply isnt all that intuitive which is a definite knock against a company that prides itself on intuitive interfaces. its possible that this has held back paid subscriptions apple does not offer an ad supported free option. its possible that a revamped interface can spur subscription growth. 00NUMBER00 million and counting    at last count apple had 00NUMBER00 million subscribers for apple music. to be clear thats a strong start for the services first nine months or so and meaningful competition compared to spotifys 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers. but spotify is growing at a fairly healthy clip adding about 00NUMBER00 million subscribers per year for the past few years. it had 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers in june 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers in 00NUMBER00. however expectations for apple should be a lot higher in which case the 00NUMBER00 million apple music subscriptions seems modest. apple has incredible strength in cross selling content and services to its users and there are now 00NUMBER00 billion active devices in its installed base. the mac maker hasnt shared any recent statistics regarding active itunes accounts but it 00NUMBER00 million active itunes accounts way back in 00NUMBER00. assuming active itunes accounts have grown since then that means the 00NUMBER00 apple music members represents less than 00NUMBER00. thats what he said    on the last earnings call ceo tim cook and cfo luca maestri noted that the music business has now hit an important inflection point. music revenue had been in a steady decline for many quarters as downloads were trending lower as consumer preferences shifted toward streaming. now that apple has both a download business and a streaming business music revenue is ready to turn around. heres cookand apple music continues to grow in popularity with 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers today. we feel really great about the early success of apples first subscription business and our music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. maestri followed upits interesting for us that our music business which had been declining for a number of quarters now that we have both a download model and a streaming model we have now hit an inflection point. and we really believe that this will be the bottom and we can start growing from there over time. with apples recent emphasis on its services business it needs to pull all the levers that it can to boost apple music subscriptions. to appreciate how much potential apple music has consider the fact that each device within the installed base spends 00NUMBER00 per quarter  in content and services average. apple music costs 00NUMBER00 per month or 00NUMBER00 per quarter. so yes growing apple music is incredibly important to the services business. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

them and obviously probably the culprit when you look at this down year over year revenue growth. so what did we see with that and what can investors make of it   nathan hamilton   we were talking about it a little bit before. you almost have to look at where apple is in the upgrade cycle and put that into context. when apple went from 00NUMBER00 to the 00NUMBER00 change in form factor everything changed and they had blockbuster sales. i cant remember the exact numbers at the time but i recall 00NUMBER00 year over year growth during some quarters when the 00NUMBER00 came out. where we are now essentially the iphone 00NUMBER00 a 00NUMBER00 form factor with better guts to it better processors that was essentially on sale starting in april. its not even reported in the most recent quarter for apple. you have to look at it that way. its pretty much expected that iphone sales will come down a little bit when there isnt a huge upgrade and when there isnt a change in the form factor altogether. you mentioned a good point you almost have to look at apple in two year cycles and say ok whats happening here because the longer term side of it apple is still adding territories. theyre still growing in a lot of different important countries. the u. s. of course isnt doing much for actual iphone unit sales. the companies pretty much trade market share. but the longer term story you see a slightly upward trending trajectory for iphones over time but from quarter to quarter definitely not. lewis   i totally agree. its tempting to look at companies comps year over year. but when you have this very clear product cadence of the new numerical issue and then the new numerical issue s and thats the year to year march. it is in some ways not really fair to compare numbers year to year. its almost more of a two year comp cycle. hamilton  yeah. and to put that in context its not just a matter of ok things will still go great for apple. if you look at previous iphone releases they did have the quarter over quarter growth even in down times where there wasnt a fresh model coming out. its not the most favorable but i dont think its anything if youre looking to apple as a somewhat safer stock to say ok im out of it hit the sell button im done apple. lewis  yeah and one other note with how particularly rough the comps that they were going up against were  they actually had a lot of supply constraints when they issued the 00NUMBER00 to begin with. so a lot of the demand for the 00NUMBER00 into this quarter. it was originally launched in fiscal 00NUMBER00 but because of pent up demand and supply issues a lot of that wound up trickling into 00NUMBER00. so that inflated what was already incredible demand because of the new form factors and a lot of the new things they brought to that line. the article why were not freaking out about iphone sales  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the motley fool llc.

the dust finally settled the day following its disappointing earnings report   the 00NUMBER00 decline in its stock had erased a total of 00NUMBER00 shareholder value roughly the value of a delta air lines   kroger   or prudential financial  vanishing in a day. emerging markets which have long been a tailwind for the tech giant proved particularly weak during the quarter. that is except for one noteworthy exception india. key bright spot    according to research company strategy analytics the global smartphone market contracted 00NUMBER00 in the first quarter the first ever recorded decline for the longtime growth market. apple predictably felt this impact. iphone unit shipments declined 00NUMBER00 compared to the same quarter last year. including revenue from other products like the ipad mac and apple watch apple saw total sales decline in four of the five major geographic segments it releases to investors. amid this weak backdrop india shone through as one of the few markets in which iphone sales actually increased. though down from 00NUMBER00 growth in its prior quarter ceo tim cook told analysts that apples iphone sales increased an impressive 00NUMBER00 over year  in india. cook then detailed the underlying factors that should help accelerate apples sales in india in the coming years. specifically he sees two issues that he believes have slowed apples market penetration. according to him. . . the lte rollout with india just really began this year and so well begin to see some really good networks coming on in india. that will unleash the power and capability of the iphone in a way that an older network 00NUMBER00 or even some 00NUMBER00 networks would not do. and so the infrastructure is one key. the second one is building the channel out. unlike the u. s. as an example where the carriers in the u. s. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the united states in india the carriers in general sell virtually no phones. up until this point apple has largely relied on third party retail distribution deals which have at times failed to meet apples lofty customer experience standards. the company has also attempted to open a series of  store within a store   concepts but has largely been unable to replicate the same retail distribution system that has proven so successful elsewhere in the world. however it appears that apple recently made a major breakthrough in expanding its retail channel in the worlds third largest smartphone market. key hurdle cleared   despite considerable opposition  from domestic handset oems the times of india   reported earlier this week that apple was likely to gain regulatory approval to open its own branded retail stores in the worlds second most populous country. according to reports indias department of industrial policy and promotion dipp committee has recommended apple be exempted from one key restriction that often impedes many international firms expansion efforts in india. typically indian regulations require companies seeking to establish their own wholly owned retail stores source at least 00NUMBER00 of the material used to produce their products from inside india. however the dipp committee can waive this requirement for certain companies that sell cutting edge technology where domestic supply sources are not available. fortunately for apple shareholders it appears the indian government will indeed waive this restriction which will allow apple to accelerate the pace of its expansion into india which serves as great news at a time when apple investors certainly need it. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

recently. given the companys historical dependence on mostly gaap metrics it has taken some slack in the media for adopting the measure. but the fact is that its a very useful metric and it gives investors excellent insight into an important aspect of the mac makers business. image source apple. an undervalued segment gets a key metric    not only is apples user base loyal to the companys portfolio of devices but their spending on content on these devices has grown over the years. indeed these revenue sources have become so important to apple that in its most recent quarter the companys services segment which includes revenue from internet services like apple music applecare apple pay licensing and other services became the companys second largest segment when measured by revenue for the first time. in 00NUMBER00 alone apples services segment revenue was about 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 of total revenue during the quarter. even more its services segment revenue was up 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter while revenue in iphone ipad and mac segments was down 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. as services becomes increasingly important to apples results the tech giant is now providing investors a more accurate picture how this segment is growing thus apples new non gaap metric measuring purchase value of services tied to apples installed base of active devices. this new metric looks at the gross value of content and services apple users are purchasing. the metric adjusts for all content and services to be reported on a gross basis instead of some being reported on a net basis and others on a gross basis. put simply it essentially levels the playing field for the way all installed base related purchases are accounted for. ios app store. image source apple. or in more specific terms heres exactly how and why apple adjusts app store and certain digital content installed base related purchases to reflect unrecognized services and content purchases straight from apples financial statementapple accounts for such purchases on a net basis by recognizing in services revenue only the commission it retains from each purchase. this non gaap adjustment reflects the portion of the gross amounts billed to customers that apple remits to third party app developers and certain digital content owners. apple considers non gaap installed base related purchases to be a useful metric for investors and management as it provides a more complete picture of the transactions generated by the installed base. for years analysts have tried to articulate the hidden value in apples services segment  by emphasizing that the companys fast growing app store revenue in particular is not counted for on a gross basis while other items included in the segment are thus understating the total segments growth. but now with this new metric investors can accurately assess the progress apple is making with growing this important segment. more potential than you think    apple ceo tim cook put the new metric and its importance to the company into context during its most recent quarterly conference call via a seeking alpha transcript  as we discussed on this call in january those 00NUMBER00 plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. in fact the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record 00NUMBER00 billion in the march quarter up 00NUMBER00 over last year accelerating from 00NUMBER00 growth rate we reported in the december quarter. the key thing to highlight in this remark from cook is that the 00NUMBER00 year over year growth rate in purchase value tied to apples installed base actually accelerated compared to 00NUMBER00. investors should continue to keep an eye on this metric. it highlights a key source of potential future growth for the apple. and significantly growth coming from the purchase value of services tied to apples installed base will be both more reliable and predictable than its unit sales of new products making revenue from the segment critical to the tech giant.

this tech episode dylan lewis talks with former host nathan hamilton about the tech markets darling child apple. first they look at four metrics that nathan identified last year for looking at apples earnings reports three to pay attention to and one to ignore and explain why they matter and how well they held up into this year. they also discuss how the companys growth in emerging markets has

recorded on april 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewis   were talking apple earnings on this throwback edition of industry focus. greetings fools and welcome to industry focus. its throwback week so were talking with some of our old hosts. i am dylan lewis the tech bureau chief at foolcom and i am joined in studio by nathan hamilton. nathan hows it going   nathan hamilton   its going awesome. glad to be back here. lewis   yeah its been a little over a year since you used to be doing this show. hamilton   you guys havent talked about apple since right laughs   lewis   nope weve been totally mum on the subject we wanted to save it for you. hamilton  well thats what well be talking about today right   lewis  yes. so you used to be the bureau chief for foolcom running the tech bureau. can you talk a little bit about what youve been doing since then   hamilton  after working in tech and consumer goods for foolcom i did a little bit of marketing on the u. s. side. more recently in the past two to three months ive been working on some of our international products. im sure a lot of the podcast listeners dont know that were also in canada and australia and have small operations in germany and were just getting ready to launch our product in singapore. so the fool brand is actually global. lewis  were going global   hamilton  we are. lewis  were taking over   hamilton  helping the world invest better. lewis  listeners if you hear me at any point in the show pining for validation its because nathan used to be my boss. laughs look how far ive come hopefully he approves. hamilton  yes yes. lewis  so for this show how can we not talk about apples earnings   hamilton  we cant. its every single headline out there. i know our readers want to hear other stuff but they also want to hear about apple as well. im happy to provide some insights. lewis  and we love doing the deep dives. hamilton  absolutely. lewis  for the most recent report revenue for the quarter was 00NUMBER00 which was down 00NUMBER00 year over year and diluted eps 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00 a year ago. one of the reasons in addition to the fact that i just couldnt resist talking about apple that i wanted to talk about apples earnings was one of your last shows you did a preview of apples earnings. you specifically honed in on four things. it was i believe the title of the show was apple earnings 00NUMBER00 things to focus on and 00NUMBER00 thing to ignore something like that. so i thought it would be fun given this most recent report to revisit those four categories. hamilton  did i predict apple at 00NUMBER00 or anything like that   lewis  i dont think so. there wont be a gotcha moment dont worry. the first of those things you wanted to focus on was iphone sales. why dont we start there for the most recent quarter 00NUMBER00 million units sold. they still clock in at roughly two thirds of their revenue so that is the big driver for them and probably the culprit when you look at this down year over year revenue growth. so what did we see with that and what can investors make of it   hamilton  we were talking about it a little bit before. you almost have to look at where apple is in the upgrade cycle and put that into context. when apple went from the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 change in form factor everything changed and they had blockbuster sales. i cant remember the exact numbers at the time but i recall 00NUMBER00 over year growth during some quarters when the 00NUMBER00 came out. where we are now essentially the iphone 00NUMBER00 essentially a 00NUMBER00 form factor with better guts to it better processors that was essentially on sale starting in april. its not even reported in the most recent quarter for apple. you have to look at it that way. its pretty much expected that iphone sales will come down a little bit when there isnt a huge upgrade and when there isnt a change in the form factor altogether. you mentioned a good point you almost have to look at apple in two year cycles and say ok whats happening here because the longer term side of it apple is still adding territories. theyre still growing in a lot of different important countries. the u. s. of course isnt doing much for actual iphone unit sales. the company is pretty much trade market share. but the longer term story you see a slightly upward trending trajectory for iphones over time but from quarter to quarter definitely not. lewis  i totally agree. its tempting to look at companies comps year over year. but when you have this very clear product cadence of the new numerical issue and then the new numerical issue s and thats the year to year march. it is in some ways not really fair to compare numbers year to year. its almost more of a two year comp cycle. hamilton  yeah. and to put that in context its not just a matter of ok things will still go great for apple. if you look at previous iphone releases they did have the quarter over quarter growth even in down times when there wasnt a fresh model coming out. its not the most favorable but i dont think its anything if youre looking to apple as a somewhat safer stock to say im out of it hit the sell button im done apple. lewis  yeah and one other note with how particularly rough the comps they were going up against were they actually had a lot of supply constraints when they issued the 00NUMBER00 to begin with. so a lot of the demand for the 00NUMBER00 bled into this quarter. it was originally launched in fiscal 00NUMBER00 but because of pent up demand and supply issues a lot of that wound up trickling into 00NUMBER00. so that inflated what was already incredible demand because of the new form factors and a lot of the new things they brought to that line. hamilton  the great debate of apple is whether they plan out their. . . strategic. . . supply shortages. who knows maybe it is theres just such high demand that they cant keep up with it. but sometimes i think a company like apple cant keep up with demand and predict but who knows thats my theory. lewis  yeah. so the second thing you mentioned in that episode a year ago was focusing in on gross margins. a year ago they clocked in just under 00NUMBER00. now theyre around 00NUMBER00. so its actually a nice little uptick. but if you look quarter to quarter the story is a little bit different. theyve actually trended down. a while back you said the days of high 00NUMBER00 gross margins which is something i think they realized as recently as 00NUMBER00 or so those days are over. and i totally agree thats just not sustainable for what theyre doing right now. is there anything youre seeing on the gross margin side or the average selling price side   hamilton  on the asp side again going back to the most recent release its not reflected in the quarter. as they mentioned on the call and as many people are predicting over the next few quarters youll probably see some pressure and some downward trends on the asp because as you look at the 00NUMBER00 se it is going to be a cheaper model. its not necessarily made for u. s. markets. im sure people will buy it here but really the play is how do we get this thing to expand in india china all the other developing economies where people want the luxury of an iphone the high end model but may not be willing to pay up for it. lewis  yes. and something we saw with this most recent report was asps were down year over year and sequentially. in the guidance. . . hamilton  tough comps again   lewis  tough comps again and thatll probably continue to trend down. as you mentioned the product mixed profile has changed dramatically with the se and the currency headwinds in the foreign markets are going to persist. thats not going anywhere either. hamilton  yeah. but for the currency headwinds just look at the constant currency revenue basis. thats the true guide of what a business is doing. if youre a short term trader ok sure you can look at that and put it into your model and see what it spits out and make your decision. but if youre longer term you just have to look at what the actual business is doing not what currencies are doing which is out of their control. lewis  yeah. looking forward from the conference call management guided for gross margin to come in somewhere between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 this upcoming quarter. again this will be down sequentially. i think thats very realistic and i think thats where youre going to continue to see things. last quarter we talked about on the show they actually had an above 00NUMBER00 gross margin and that was a slightly inflated number because they had 00NUMBER00 million coming in via a patent dispute with samsung. that added to the top line and that was not the true measure of the product operations. that was just a one off that was coming in. hamilton  yeah one time non recurring. lewis  exactly. so dont get too used to the idea of those 00NUMBER00. i think well be seeing them in the mid to high 00NUMBER00. hamilton  but at the same time and well talk about this a little bit the high margin businesses they do have that as we look at it pretty much as i see it en fuego. theyre not super meaningful to the company. . . well to apple. but any other company any of those companies as a single one company would be a huge success but not in apples standards. lewis  and we will tease that and make you wait until the second half of the show to get into that. one of the other big things he wanted to focus in on was the capital return program. at the time it was a 00NUMBER00 billion program. it has now since ballooned to 00NUMBER00 billion which is kind of crazy. most recently they announced the board authorized an additional 00NUMBER00 billion in share repurchases so that total is 00NUMBER00 the remainder of course going in the way of dividend payments. you are an apple shareholder. hamilton  i am. lewis  im also an apple shareholder. i love seeing these types of programs what about you   hamilton  i do its pretty much expected at this point because when youre generating as much cash as apple is even with gross margin pressures even when the asp is coming down its still a very good business to own. and also well address this as well what the perceptions or thinking should be for apple in the future as an investor. but its definitely a positive. i would like a little more dividend because right now its just above a 00NUMBER00 yield. but when you add in the fact that its trading below 00NUMBER00 times earnings for a company like apple at this very moment when i checked 00NUMBER00 minutes before this podcast  its definitely something to consider. but all together they have to increase that capital return program overtime. i believe it extends through 00NUMBER00. im sure in six nine 00NUMBER00 months from now well see a further extension of it. but sometimes i prefer dividends over buybacks. lewis  yeah. but either way more good of the same for investors. hamilton  absolutely. lewis  the one thing you said to ignore when you did the show was eps in apples report. you said the 00NUMBER00 eps estimate doesnt tell you anything about where the company is going to be in the next five years. this quarter i think they delivered 00NUMBER00 per share diluted per share earnings was within guidance but off analyst expectations. so ill pose to you again is this something we should ignore   hamilton  this is my personal opinion. its not a one size fits all for everyone. i honestly over the past year even the most recent quarter i could not tell you what apples eps numbers were. i could tell you everything else about the business and discuss it. but its not anything i focus on because for the way i invest it just doesnt have any relevance. some people out there maybe it does make sense. maybe they do need to focus on eps. and maybe im back tracking on my staunch stance before. but i think for the type of investing we look at in the motley fool and maybe you do with your apple shares and the way i do with mine it just doesnt matter at all. its a headline number that people focus on for week after earnings then completely forget about and remember a week before earnings are in the next quarter. for me it just doesnt give any sort of indication of the business. for example i believe their revenues were 00NUMBER00 accounting for currency fluctuations. dont quote me on that exactly but i believe it was right around that number. thats uncontrollable. lewis  yeah thats a macro factor you cant do anything about. hamilton  yeah. does it tell you anything about the business no not necessarily. does it tell that apple is no longer innovative no. does it tell you that apple is managing its expenses well as that currency flows down to net income no. it doesnt tell you all the important stuff. taking that into account for my purposes i just dont focus on it. but hey if there are people out there who do id love to hear your opinions. send me an email ill look it over. lewis  yeah im a firm believer in checking out the underlying business segments and using them as my guide. so the second half of the show well get into that a little bit. before we do listeners if you enjoy our podcasts and youre interested in hearing a little bit more from the fool check us out at focus. foolcom. there we have a special offer for our stock advisor  newsletter for industry focus  listeners. so second half of the show. i thought it would be fun to look at some of the big differences between the apple of today and the apple of a year plus ago  how the business has changed a little bit some segments that are now a little bit more relevant than they had been in the past. just taking stock of where things are. over the last 00NUMBER00 months apples actually down 00NUMBER00 which is crazy. hamilton  yeah were not loving that huh   lewis  no especially as someone who had added to my position during that period. laughs   hamilton  did you catch the high or the low   lewis  i caught bits of both. dollar cost average right always continue to buy and make sure youre working down that dollar cost average. hamilton  very foolish. lewis  of course. compared to the previous 00NUMBER00 months they were up over 00NUMBER00. so there was a period where it was very hard to be down on an apple position. obviously the story has changed a little bit there. i think looking at things to be very optimistic about as an investor from this most recent report the services segment has to be one of them. this is of course the segment of their business that houses app store apple music apple pay just to name a few. they revealed that this is their second largest revenue driver which blows my mind. i didnt realize it was getting that big and i think a lot of people were surprised by that number. but it 00NUMBER00 billion last quarter which is up 00NUMBER00. one of the things that showed i think that there would be an increased emphasis moving forward on this is in the conference call they described this new non gaap metric. theyre calling it the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. last quarter that was 00NUMBER00 billion. if thats not a sexy accounting name i dont know what is. hamilton  laughs is that official gaap legal language   lewis  no they had to somehow curb that in. hamilton  it is a good metric though. i really like that theyre breaking it out. lewis  yeah so this is essentially the value of stuff their service segment is facilitating. the reason they have to create this metric is because there are a couple different accounting approaches for the different segments. some of them run on gross accounting and some of them run on net accounting in terms of what actually shows up in the financial statements. so this is done to clean up all of that. you hinted at this earlier. a couple things for investors here. one of them is this segment operates in kind of a different margin profile than what youd expect with the hardware business right   hamilton  absolutely. its essentially an asset light business where there are high margins that are accompanying it but you also have to put it in the context you said it exactly there about 00NUMBER00 billion worth of revenue    lewis  and i think it was 00NUMBER00 billion of facilitated transactions. that new non gaap number is 00NUMBER00 actual revenue is 00NUMBER00 billion. hamilton  then put that in the context of the iphone and you start to see how itll actually affect the margins. its not a huge driver. but could apple add five to 00NUMBER00 of these businesses over time sure. add some margins get a couple billion out of them. that sounds hilarious when you think about it. but it definitely is something to consider. apple pay the actual gross purchase volume is up. but put in context of the payments market as a whole i believe apple is around 00NUMBER00 billion in payment volume. paypal   over the december quarter not matching up exactly was 00NUMBER00 billion. theres definitely room to grow there. and the important thing which i think is definitely necessary to focus on is the apple ecosystem. tim cook hit upon it in the call. essentially you hold your iphone it can really do everything. and what its doing at this point is nothing compared to what it eventually can do. it doesnt control your home doesnt control your car doesnt control your desktop computer doesnt control your life and everything around you when it comes down to it. and those are businesses that apple very well could get into and essentially generate more revenue from the ecosystem. its just like telecom. once youre locked in its a pain in the butt to change. lewis  yeah. i am an entrenched mac user ios user. i love having it all in one place i love being fully integrated. im going to change out of that dragging kicking and screaming and ill hate it if i ever do. hamilton  you are what the financial world would call a sticky customer. lewis  yes. hamilton  thats exactly what apple has within their ecosystem. there is value to it and it seems like theyre recognizing that with the new metric just seeing what value this creates subsequent knock on events and so forth. so i like that theyre breaking it out. but also put it in context. if youre looking for significant growth to hit apple the company as a whole from these businesses lets wait a little bit and see. lewis  yeah. it is another way to enhance the value of that 00NUMBER00 billion installed base that they have. its a tack on there. hopefully they can monetize that group a little bit more. hamilton  healthcare stuff thats something that hasnt even been tapped into at all. i dont think apple even knows exactly what they want to do with it at this point but theres definitely a lot of potential there. lewis  another thing this was not available when you were talking about apple and doing the show the apple watch. laughs unfortunately we still dont know a ton about it which is maddening. the company has been kind of infuriatingly opaque about the apple watch. on the most recent call we got this unit sales of apple watch during its first year exceeded sales of iphone in its first year which means they sold at least 00NUMBER00. some analysts think its closer to 00NUMBER00 million. asps are believed to be around 00NUMBER00. so this business right now looks like a 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion business. not huge but again something to watch. it gets people more involved in their ecosystem. hamilton  by all business standards that is a huge success. there are good things about the apple watch. i recall one article i recently read where it said more than 00NUMBER00 of apple watch buyers just dont think the watch has much value. its important to put that into context. is that the thinking now and will that be the thinking two three years from now after theyre able to iterate upon error maybe they add more health capabilities controlling i guess internet of things sort of ideas and controlling your home and so forth. i think it could be a good idea but when you have to look at it now and what it means i just dont think its a huge success even by apples standards. it almost feels a bit like the ipad. the ipad sales are trending down over the last one one and a half years during that time frame. still generate a lot of revenue has high enough margin where youre getting cash flow. its going to contribute to buying back shares its going to contribute to investing in the company and growth. but i would like to see something a little more innovative out of it. and at this moment i just dont see it. lewis  yeah the reception has been a little bit flat. hamilton  yeah it has. lewis  one of the big markets that people have been talking about for quite some time is china and the huge market potential there. a year ago the company posted 00NUMBER00 over year growth in mainland china. this quarter revenue was down 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 in constant currency something you like to focus on. both of these are less than overall declines but still not ideal for what everyone considers to be a very high growth market for them. hamilton  yeah. and if i recall a year ago we were very big on it saying chinas a huge contributor. and it very well will be over time. that was when they were just starting to bring some big telecoms on board expanding 00NUMBER00 coverage and you sort of see the uptake when the iphone expands to a population that didnt really have much of it before. so you get that hockey stick growth to it. it has cooled down a little bit. its interesting because if you looked at the headlines before we record here see carl icahn on the front page of yahoo  finance saying ive sold my apple position and one reason is that china is a concern. for example theyve shut down apples services including the app store. those are higher margin businesses with a huge population. apple loves their ecosystem they have to get it out to them but what if the app store cant do that how do they actually get the ecosystem out and expand upon it its definitely something to consider. but i think in the grand scheme of things its still pretty favorable. there are a lot of favorable factors within china. lewis  and tim cook made the point here during the conference call theyre taking an 00NUMBER00 dip on 00NUMBER00 growth. thats still a very large segment. and even if it didnt grow year over year its still contributing for the company. hamilton  the shareholders want the good money. its disappointing to me. i know we can frame it either way. its slower growth coming out of blockbuster growth but youre only as good as what you just did. you have to continue and offer up growth. otherwise people will be questioning the future. lewis  if youre looking for a regional market to be excited about as an apple investor i think its india just based on the most recent call. tim cook in talking about the market potential there said india is where china was maybe seven 00NUMBER00 years ago. for the region iphone sales this most recent quarter was up 00NUMBER00 year over year. thats obviously a bright spot in that report. the retail business is a little bit different there because you dont have these telecoms the wireless providers acting as a storefront for smartphone manufacturers. they have to build out their retail presence. so the challenges there are quite different. but if youre an apple investor and you want something to put in your bull cap thats one of the things. hamilton  yeah. one thing to look for if you pay close attention to apple and what happened with the government in india is a lot of american companies have had difficulties opening up brick and mortar establishments within india. so you kind of have to look at that to change. over time wal mart   has been able to and some other retailers have been able to. but its definitely a roadblock with the government that it does slow down growth from what it could be. what theyve had recently is very impressive growth but it could be even better if things were firing on all cylinders with the government which we know probably wont happen. lewis  maybe thatll change in time. hamilton  yeah. but its interesting when you back it up to their product strategy as a whole with the iphone se. obviously thats a play for markets like india where there is huge competition from the likes of xiaomi. theyre hitting it hard with very good high quality phones some say on par with what the iphone offers for a far cheaper price. lewis  yeah the price point is dramatically different. hamilton  yeah. they have a really good strategy in india so far. apple will be bumping up against them quite a bit. lewis  you mentioned carl icahn has sold his entire position in apple. that was one of the big news items of the past week following earnings of course. he cited concerns of the chinese market. one of the things he did say though is that the stock is still cheap on a multiples basis. so i have to ask you what are your thoughts on the company at this point where do they fit in   hamilton  ill give you my thoughts but actually go back to some thinking i had maybe two years ago when i loaded up on a few more apple shares. i told myself if apple ever dips below nine times earnings im going to buy shares regardless of whether i think its a high growth company or just want a dividend or some sort of income. right now shares are just below 00NUMBER00 times earnings which on all accounts if you compare it to ibm   oracle   cisco   who are all trading for multiples above 00NUMBER00 times earnings it does look pretty cheap. but you have to put it in context. i still think  and maybe ill go on a little bit of a rant here a lot of people still think of apple as a growth company. and i dont know if its just looking in from the outside and not recognizing exactly what apple is and whats happening with the business but its really not when it comes down to it. you almost have to focus on it and say what do i want to invest in apple for how im looking at it at this point is i like the dividend i like the capital return program. im holding for the longer term when it comes down to it. but as you look over ok two to three years from now based upon what we know at this very moment us not being a board member not being part of jony ives design team and knowing exactly what theyre working on these game changing products we dont know exactly whats going to come out in the next few years. you have to look at it over that time frame and say ok theres nothing that really stands out and says revenue is going to move significantly and ill see my share price increase by that amount. so im all about the dividend now. lewis  to your point about it not being a growth company anymore its very difficult to experience extreme growth when youre already at a market cap of like 00NUMBER00 billion. hamilton  yeah. not to say they cant do it. but lightning striking twice like the iphone and doing so over the next few years which for many investors thats the time frame they look at   i dont necessarily believe thatll be the case. but maybe well do a throwback show two years from now and im completely eating my words. its not a hard prediction but all the signs point in that direction. lewis  yeah. and a lot of investors have done very well by buying and holding dividend paying tech companies driping the dividends and letting that compound over time. hamilton  nothings wrong with that yeah. if youre into options selling puts selling calls those are all strategies to grab more income if you want to juice up that 00NUMBER00 yield if its not sexy enough for you. lewis  on my end    hamilton  yeah what are you doing   lewis  im still an apple bull. perhaps after the necessary period passes where were not allowed to buy after talking about a company for a certain amount of time i might consider adding to my position. but im really not going to be    hamilton  sorry lets flip the interview here. why are you thinking to add to the position   lewis  im not freaked out about iphone sales and i wont be until i see what happens with the iphone 00NUMBER00. i think like we were talking about before the two year comp cycle is much more relevant. people know the big changes will come when the number changes on the phone. so im not too worried about it. if they come out with a dud on the iphone 00NUMBER00 then you start to think ok this is real stability. im still in the same camp as you with it being more of a moderate to low growth company that pays a nice dividend thatll be around forever. but i think a lot of the iphone issues and the concerns there are a little overblown. im also excited to see what happens with the emerging markets. i think india is a huge opportunity. i think once they refresh the iphone 00NUMBER00 there should be some nice response in china as well. hamilton  wouldnt it be amazing if apple surprises us and says were not doing an iphone 00NUMBER00 were going back. they almost did with the se somewhat. lewis  yeah and thats a great way to meet that market. so well see what happens there. hamilton  absolutely. lewis  thank you for your time nathan. its been great to have you back on the show. hamilton  yeah i love doing this stuff. lewis  listeners how are you guys feeling about apple send in

should be good news not just for investors getting a piece but also for the companys stock price. the company announced along with earnings on april 00NUMBER00 the board has authorized an increase of 00NUMBER00 to its capital return program bringing it to 00NUMBER00 billion. in this clip from the  industry focus tech    podcastdylan lewis and nathan hamilton talk about apples capital return programs where they were a year ago and how they have expanded since then. they also examine why shareholders are generally pleased as punch about them and one area where the company might stand to improve them. a transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on april 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewis  one of the other big things he wanted to focus in on was the capital return program. at the time it was a 00NUMBER00 billion program. it has now since ballooned to 00NUMBER00 is kind of crazy. most recently they announced the board authorized an additional 00NUMBER00 billion in share repurchases so that total is 00NUMBER00 of course going in the way of dividend payments. you are an apple shareholder. nathan hamilton   i am. lewis   im also an apple shareholder. i love seeing these types of programs what about you   hamilton   i do its pretty much expected at this point because when youre generating as much cash as apple is even with gross margin pressures even when the asp is coming down its still a very good business to own. and also well address this as well what the perceptions or thinking should be for apple in the future as an investor. but its definitely a positive. i would like a little more dividend because right now its just above a 00NUMBER00 yield. but when you add in the fact that its trading below 00NUMBER00 times earnings for a company like apple at this very moment when i checked 00NUMBER00 minutes before this podcast  its definitely something to consider. but altogether they have to increase that capital return program over time. i believe it extends through 00NUMBER00. im sure in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 months from now well see a further extension of it. but sometimes i prefer dividends over buybacks. lewis  yeah. but either way more good of the same for investors. hamilton   absolutely. the article apple inc. s 00NUMBER00 billion love note to investors  originally appeared on foolcom. copyright â© 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the

nathan hamilton talk about a few of the biggest ways apple  has changed in the last year from its stock price to its business segments. listen in to hear how focusing more on their services segment has set apple up for fantastic growth potential how different the companys services segment is from the rest of their segments and how apples emphasis on their ecosystem could mean huge opportunities for them in the coming years. a transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts

early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on april 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewis  i thought it would be fun to look at some of the big differences between the apple of today and the apple of a year plus ago  how the business has changed a little bit some segments that are now a little bit more relevant than they had been in the past. just taking stock of where things are. over the last 00NUMBER00 months apples actually down 00NUMBER00 which is crazy. nathan hamilton  yeah were not loving that huh   lewis  no especially as someone who had added to my position during that period. laughs   hamilton  did you catch the high or the low   lewis  i caught bits of both. dollar cost average right always continue to buy and make sure youre working down that dollar cost average. hamilton  very foolish. lewis  of course. compared to the previous 00NUMBER00 months they were up over 00NUMBER00. so there was a period where it was very hard to be down on an apple position. obviously the story has changed a little bit there. i think looking at things to be very optimistic about as an investor from this most recent report the services segment has to be one of them. this is of course the segment of their business that houses app store apple music apple pay just to name a few. they revealed that this is their second largest revenue driver which blows my mind. i didnt realize it was getting that big and i think a lot of people were surprised by that number. but it provided 00NUMBER00 quarter which is up 00NUMBER00. one of the things that showed i think that there would be an increased emphasis moving forward on this is in the conference call they described this new non gaap metric. theyre calling it the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. last quarter that was 00NUMBER00 billion. if thats not a sexy accounting name i dont know what is. hamilton  laughs is that official gaap legal language   lewis  no they had to somehow curb that in. hamilton  it is a good metric though. i really like that theyre breaking it out. lewis  yeah so this is essentially the value of stuff their service segment is facilitating. the reason they have to create this metric is because there are a couple different accounting approaches for the different segments. some of them run on gross accounting and some of them run on net accounting in terms of what actually shows up in the financial statements. so this is done to clean up all of that. you hinted at this earlier. a couple things for investors here. one of them is this segment operates in kind of a different margin profile than what youd expect with the hardware business right   hamilton  absolutely. its essentially an asset light business where there are high margins that are accompanying it but you also have to put it in the context you said it exactly there about 00NUMBER00 billion worth of revenue. . . lewis  and i think it was 00NUMBER00 billion of facilitated transactions. that new non gaap number is 00NUMBER00 actual revenue is 00NUMBER00 billion. hamilton  then put that in the context of the iphone and you start to see how itll actually affect the margins. its not a huge driver but could apple add five to 00NUMBER00 of these businesses over time sure. add some margins get a couple billion out of them. that sounds hilarious when you think about it. but it definitely is something to consider. apple pay the actual gross purchase volume is up. but put in context of the payments market as a whole i believe apple is around 00NUMBER00 billion in payment volume. paypal   over the december quarter not matching up exactly was 00NUMBER00 billion. theres definitely room to grow there. and the important thing which i think is definitely necessary to focus on is the apple ecosystem. tim cook hit upon it in the call. essentially you hold your iphone it can really do everything. and what its doing at this point is nothing compared to what it eventually can do. it doesnt control your home doesnt control your car doesnt control your desktop computer doesnt control your life and everything around you when it comes down to it. and those are businesses that apple very well could get into and essentially generate more revenue from the ecosystem. its just like telecom. once youre locked in its a pain in the butt to change. lewis  yeah. i am an entrenched mac user ios user. i love having it all in one place. i love being fully integrated. im going to change out of that dragging kicking and screaming and ill hate it if i ever do. hamilton  you are what the financial world would call a sticky customer. lewis  yes. hamilton  thats exactly what apple has within their ecosystem. there is value to it and it seems like theyre recognizing that with the new metric just seeing what value this creates subsequent knock on events and so forth. so i like that theyre breaking it out. but also put it in context. if youre looking for significant growth to hit apple the company as a whole from these businesses lets wait a little bit and see. lewis  yeah. it is another way to enhance the value of that 00NUMBER00 billion installed base that they have. its a tack on there. hopefully they can monetize that group a little bit more. hamilton  healthcare stuff thats something that hasnt even been tapped into at all. i dont think apple even knows exactly what they want to do with it at this point but theres definitely a lot of potential there. the article apple inc. s services segment is bigger than you

giants valuation. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  less than two weeks after failing to meet earnings expectations and recording the first year over year decline in iphone sales to date apple aapl  finds itself with a host of new headaches this week. the first piece of major news surrounding the company comes out of china where a court ruled against the company in a major trademark battle. after losing in two lower courts apple lost again after the beijing municipal high peoples court ruled that leather goods manufacturer xintong tiandi could continue to print the word iphone on its mobile phone cases. xintong tiandi which has squared off against apple in several other cases trademarked the word iphone for use on leather products back in 00NUMBER00. apple first brought this case against the company nearly four years ago. apple will now try its last legal option by appealing to the supreme peoples court. also on thursday apple was forced to deal with a major disruption to its app store program. for nearly seven hours a company system status page said that all users were affected by an issue with the app store not working as expected for all users. the problem which appeared to be related to the app stores search function not displaying results correctly has since been resolved. finally questions are starting to be raised about apples ability to handle its users data after a recent blog post  complaining about apple music exploded across the internet. apparently one apple music user saw over 00NUMBER00 gb of music files disappear from their computer after using the service. this is not the first report of missing files thanks to apple music and the company itself has seemingly admitted that it is a known issue. for the latest news on apple make sure to follow our analysis on the companys ticker pagewant the latest recommendations from zacks

investorplace investorplace  stock market news stock advice trading tipsapple inc. aapl    suffered its first sales decline in 00NUMBER00 years during its last quarter and as a result aapl stock has since continued to fall to mark one of the worst periods of market capitalization losses in the companys history. the reason for this loss is its 00NUMBER00 decline in revenue last quarter which illustrates just how quickly the problems have piled up for the worlds most valuable company. however things are not as bad as investors think for apple. in fact many of the beliefs regarding apples sales decline last quarter are assumptions and not considering the entire story. so with that i will say that these double digit declines are no big concern for aapl stock owners. at the epicenter of the investors problem with aapl stock lies the notion that apple is no longer growing. however apples growth rate right now is actually unchanged from the last four years. for example apple grew total revenue by 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. keep in mind that year over year revenue growth naturally declines as a company grows larger. yet in 00NUMBER00 apple grew a whopping 00NUMBER00 as it launched two devices the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus penetrated into new markets and the u. s. wireless industry adopted a new business strategy that allowed annual upgrades. 00NUMBER00 great stocks to buy now to trump the summer slumpso if you consider that revenue grew 00NUMBER00 last year and 00NUMBER00 in its last quarter then the annualized growth rate for 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 has not really changed all that much from 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. hence the big growth related losses that aapl stock is realizing right now dont actually apply. that said apple could 00NUMBER00 sales decline all year and it would still maintain that same growth rate on a compound annualized basis because of the factors that caused 00NUMBER00 be so strong. fortunately that is very unlikely to occur. although the companys latest products iphone se and 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro launched too late to have a material impact on apples most recent quarter aapl will launch a new generation of iphones later this year that are sure to catapult sales in comparison to this current years s refresh of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. all things considered one could argue that aapl stock is better positioned today than it has been in many years. at 00NUMBER00 next years expected earnings per share aapl stock is at its cheapest point since late 00NUMBER00. apple continues to grow on a compound annualized basis with many bright spots to push aapl stock higher long term. for example there might have been what seemed like weaknesses during apples last quarter but even during a tough comparable period last year apples service revenue still grew 00NUMBER00 and sales in india skyrocketed 00NUMBER00. your 00NUMBER00 retirement spring cleaning checklistkeep in mind india could be equivalent to china  as a smartphone market and thats why apple has made big investments to grow market share in the region. currently apple has very little presence in india but the fact that it grew so quickly suggests that its plan to grow market share is working. with services investors have been demanding for years that apple show innovation to create a revenue stream other than iphones to drive the business forward. services has become that business with 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue last quarter and 00NUMBER00 growth. best of all most of the businesses like apple

really standout towards the end of 00NUMBER00 as the iphone 00NUMBER00 rolls out and sparks year over year growth. that said china is a problem. it represented 00NUMBER00 billion in quarterly revenue and sales declined 00NUMBER00. the good news is that most of apples china revenue up until this point came from china mobile. the nations other two large telecom companies were not even approved for

released its worst earnings report in years management has gone on a charm offensive to reassure investors and maybe even themselves as well. ceo tim cook has never had the star power that steve jobs did but now the company has been thrown into a position of having to show and prove. theres no more benefit of the doubt. for the fiscal second quarter apple saw results miss on both the top and bottom lines. earnings of 00NUMBER00 a share were down from 00NUMBER00 a share last year and 00NUMBER00 below estimates while revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion came in 00NUMBER00 billion short of expectations. this was aapls first quarterly drop in sales since 00NUMBER00. adding to the injury iphone unit sales fell 00NUMBER00 in the quarter and sales in greater china declined 00NUMBER00. guidance for the third quarter was also lower than expected with management looking for revenue of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion compared to estimates closer to 00NUMBER00 billion. 00NUMBER00 cheap stocks to buy for big bucksin addition management announced a 00NUMBER00 hike to its dividend and a 00NUMBER00 billion increase  to its capital return program. but with that still leaving apple sitting on more cash than many of the worlds nations investors are antsy to learn how the company plans to spend that all that money. and political candidates see it as greed personified. the company said it plans to spend 00NUMBER00 billion by the end of march 00NUMBER00 and is now talking about acquisitions both large and small. that coupled with an increasing need for a new company with a wow factor and im led to believe were looking at the driverless car. if thats the case aapl needs to power up on technology and in my opinion that puts mobileye nv     mbly    in the bullseye. mobileye is a key player in the autonomous automobile industry which is an area that i think will come to fruition much sooner than many expect. its technology is based on advanced vision algorithms that help motorists avoid collisions by interpreting a scene in real time and taking immediate evasive action. this system is known as the advanced driver assistance system and its pretty cool stuff. theres no denying this is a crowded field but the stakes are so high that every major silicon valley tech giant is a player. so i think theres probably a 00NUMBER00 chance we see aapl make a bid for mobileye. and if it doesnt one of the giants should. in the most recent quarter mbly earned 00NUMBER00 a share and saw revenue grow 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 million. both numbers beat the street. the number of eyeq chips sold jumped 00NUMBER00 over a year ago and the average selling price increased  from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. mobileye stock has been edging higher and a close 00NUMBER00 could spark a massive rally higher. it will be interesting to see whether a buyout offer comes before that move or not but nonetheless mbly remains an attractive target for any of the tech giants. get more behind

darling falls out of favor on weaker fundamentals and the technical picture starts to follow suit it gets me excited. click to enlargemost of the suits and ties will tell you not to trade apple inc. aapl. instead they will tell you to hold the stock for years. perhaps the dividend is being taken into consideration but apple is currently only paying 00NUMBER00 a year for a dividend yield of 00NUMBER00. the company could certainly pay more but it is still hoarding cash while making subtle acquisitions. 00NUMBER00 stocks to buy for a set it and forget it summer portfolioapples most recent quarter  in april was a disaster across the board and the company reported a 00NUMBER00 cent earnings miss. revenues of 00NUMBER00 billion also fell shy of forecasts for a reading of just under 00NUMBER00. the company also lowered its current quarter revenue guidance to between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 billion versus estimates for 00NUMBER00. gross margins between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 are still impressive but apple needs growth in new areas to offset declines in others. i mentioned above that the technical outlook for apple was looking weak as all of the major moving averages are in a downtrend. the two year chart also shows that a break below 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 would be a bearish development and there is the possibility that the mid 00NUMBER00 range could come into play. while there is a good chance that shares could rally back to somewhere between 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00 level represents a much tougher hurdle as it marks the gap down from previous support near 00NUMBER00. analysts have been giddy on the pullback from 00NUMBER00 week high just south of 00NUMBER00 as they are still recommending the stock. on monday rbc capital said that apple was oversold and that the companys gross margins are poised to increase. im not sure if they read the fine print but i just mentioned that apples gross margins would come in around 00NUMBER00 for the current quarter. rbc kept its outperform rating and 00NUMBER00 price target on the stock. another brokerage firm kept its outperform rating on the stock as well even though it said that apples share buybacks were below average  in march. i would like to see apple trade a little higher over the next week or two to see if resistance levels hold. if so put options will become cheaper and ive listed the ones im targeting below. i could also use these options if apple shares have peaked and a move below 00NUMBER00 comes over the near term. apple inc. aapl tim cook wont turn apple around by just being tim cookthe aapl june 00NUMBER00 puts 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 up 00NUMBER00 are my first choice to play a breakdown on a move 00NUMBER00. these options have over a month of time premium to allow a potential trade to play out. if shares fall below 00NUMBER00 by mid june these options would just about double from current levels. the aapl july 00NUMBER00 puts 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 up 00NUMBER00 would give the potential trade over two months to play out. these options would nearly double from current levels if shares are below 00NUMBER00 technically by mid july. i am currently sitting on the

tipsdigital music news  ignited a firestorm among music fans especially those who buy their music from itunes when the publication reported that  apple inc. aapl    was preparing to pull the plug on selling music downloads within two years. the vitriol unleashed against apple that this story unleashed was so intense that it led to the company issuing a rare direct denial responding directly to digital music news  the following dayour response is that it is not true we are not shutting down itunes downloads per your story yesterday. there are plenty of apple rumors out there every day but many of them are rather far fetched and thus taken with a huge grain of salt. the possibility of apple itunes ditching paid music downloads struck a nerve not because digital music news  cited sources with close and active business relationships with apple that is a frequent mantra on apple rumor sites but because of a confluence of events that add credence to the possibility. 00NUMBER00 ways you will watch tv by 00NUMBER00 in apples history of disrupting the music industry and ruthlessly pruning its own products and you have the perfect recipe for a massive itunes shakeup. the first supporting point is the decline of online music sales. according to riaa stats digital music download sales in the u. s. declined from 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion last year. in its story digital music news  zeroes in on worldwide itunes music sales which it says are on a pace to slide 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 over last year with projections it would drop to 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00 from a high of 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00. in other words if itunes music sales werent a drop in the bucket for aapl already they will be. second the launch of apple music has made an increasingly public mess out of integration with existing itunes libraries. controversy continues to flare over purchased itunes tracks and personally ripped 00NUMBER00 allegedly being deleted from hard drives when a user signs up for apple music. those affected still have access to their purchased music via apple music but if they cancel the service the apple itunes downloads they paid for are gone. third apple is the poster child for music industry disruption. apple itunes downloads are blamed or credited depending on your viewpoint with killing the traditional music store decimating cd sales and ushering in the age of paid digital downloads. if apple has upended the music business model once it could do it again. finally apple has a history of killing off products even those that are still making money. from the newton to the ipod classic if it is seen as cannibalizing sales from another product or doesnt fit the companys current vision apple has had no qualms about axing it. and yet â€¦if the digital downloads through apple itunes do  fall to the 00NUMBER00 million level within a few years that is indeed a drop in the bucket for aapl but its still revenue revenue that doesnt cost aapl much money to earn. the infrastructure from payment to download is already in place and there really arent even marketing costs. the record labels handle that. more importantly abandoning digital music sales would create a very sticky situation on the apple itunes front. whatever technical problem the company is having with apple music not playing nice with purchased tracks would not go away. those purchased downloads will still be there. apple would likely have to embark on a project to either separate apple music from itunes or export purchased music to a new app one would be needed for both ios and os x so buyers would still be able to play those tracks they bought. abandoning itunes music owners to their own fate would be a pr nightmare. theyd have to export their music library to an alternative and with the dominance of itunes there isnt exactly a huge selection of third party apple compatible music libraryplayer software out there. apple what you should expect at wwdc 00NUMBER00 apple were to make any move that was interpreted as abandoning those who paid for music through itunes the move could decimate consumer confidence in digital downloads. most services include legal language that essentially defines the transaction as rights to the file as opposed to actually owning the copy but from a consumer perspective they paid for the music and they own it. pulling the rug out in any way would hurt not just apple but any company that sells digital files from movies to e books. im not saying apple will never  stop selling music through itunes but i dont see it happening any time this decade. any problem that doing so might help address only leads to even bigger problems. in the long term it may happen but it will require extremely careful planning and a cautious approach. in the meantime that revenue is still useful. as of this writing brad moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. pebble the first victim of

billion in didi chuxing the biggest ride hailing company in china and one of ubers main competitors. this move could help the tech giant in its china efforts especially after the company has run into regulatory issues and increased competition for its apple pay service in the country. ceo tim cook hopes that this rare investment will help apple understand the important chinese market. we are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the china market he said in an interview. of course we believe it will deliver a strong return for our invested capital over time as well. cheng wei founder and chief executive of didi chuxing said that the recognition from apple tremendously encourages didi that was founded four years ago. together with drivers ride sharers and friends from the world didi will continue to make efforts on enabling everyone to have various ways to travel helping solve urban transportation problems and environmental and employment challenges. formerly known as didi kuaidi didi chuxing said in a statement that this was the single biggest investment it has ever received. the company which has previously raised billions of dollars rules the ride sharing market in china. didi said it completes more 00NUMBER00 million rides a day and it works with more than 00NUMBER00 million drivers across 00NUMBER00 chinese cities with 00NUMBER00 million users. didi is reportedly valued at upwards of 00NUMBER00 billion but is nowhere near ubers valuation of 00NUMBER00 billion. according to  reuters    didi has been losing billions in a costly battle with uber for market share in china. and similarly enough uber ceo travis kalanick recently told tech site betakit that his company is 00NUMBER00 billion a year in china. in response to the news kalanick jokingly tweetedgirlfriend owns apple  shares which makes her a didi investor. . . smh ridesharewars domesticissues thanksalottimit

hailing giant reports indicate that didi occupies anywhere between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the market in china. in an increasingly crowded space apple managed to find a way in. apples investment in didi may be just what the company needs to bring itself back from its disappointing performance last quarter its sales dropped for the first time in 00NUMBER00 years and its current stock price at about

apple inc. aapl    with shares taking a dramatic tumble most recently during the month of april. the existing downtrend was exacerbated by a not so hot second quarter earnings report. apple suffered a year over year drop in iphone shipments revenue and  earnings. eps tallied 00NUMBER00 per share   which was 00NUMBER00 cents shy of wall streets consensus and a far cry for the year ago results of

recently seconding bernsteins call that apples services revenue   if better monetized has a potential price tag of 00NUMBER00 trillion especially as operations in china and india continue to grow. i agree that there remain things to like about apple stock despite the recent negativity especially with regards to its current valuation and its forward dividend yield of over 00NUMBER00. but i would caution investors eagerly jumping in because they believe apple stock has gotten its groove back. a return to an uptrend is still going to be a far cry from the apple of old and the company still needs to get back to growth. remember when apple burst onto the scene it was part of a huge transformation taking place in the tech world. but because the company hit wall street a third of a century ago theres simply less room for upside from the tech behemoth. there are billions of smartphones and other gadgets already on the market meaning remaining customer segments are even harder to capture. at the same time apple built its business on margins and those are beginning to deteriorate as weve seen. put another way if cramer co. is correct that apple can cash in on emerging markets and monetize services the stock could indeed start chugging higher again. but if youre looking for the next silicon valley gamechanger youve come to the wrong place. at a certain point successful revolutionaries become the new establishment as disruption creates its own status quo. wmt stock is wal mart stores inc. the best of breed in retailwith that in mind id much rather spend my time looking for companies with spectacular futures that are priced like the start ups they are as opposed to picking a company like apple that despite the bloodbath is still price liked a giant and is

shares of the tech juggernaut are down by more than 00NUMBER00 the last year due to falling revenue in the critical iphone segment. however ceo tim cook believes the decline in iphone sales is only a short term problem. nearly 00NUMBER00 of total apple revenue comes from the iphone segment so the product is vital in terms of overall financial performance. apple registered a 00NUMBER00 decline in iphone unit sales during the quarter ended in march and total company level revenue fell 00NUMBER00 versus the same quarter in 00NUMBER00. but thats old news for investors at this stage. the big question to consider is whether the decline is only temporary or if apple is on a long term decline due to languishing iphone demand in the years ahead. apple ceo tim cook is an interested party in this discussion so investors need to take some distance when analyzing his point of view. nevertheless mr. cook makes a strong case that the iphone will continue growing in the future. here are his own words from apples last earnings conference calliphone sales come from three sources customers who upgrade from previous iphone models customers who switch from android and other operating systems and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time. as we look at each of these three sources of iphone sales we see a business that is healthy and strong. here are three reasons cook says we shouldnt lose faith in the iphone. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was an explosive success for apple in 00NUMBER00. many customers were eagerly waiting for a new iphone with a larger screen so sales skyrocketed. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is not a game changer compared to previous models and this is making comparisons remarkably challenging in 00NUMBER00. the company sold 00NUMBER00 million devices during the quarter ended in march of 00NUMBER00 a huge increase of 00NUMBER00 versus the same quarter in 00NUMBER00. unit sales during the quarter ended in march 00NUMBER00 to almost 00NUMBER00 million down 00NUMBER00 from the same quarter in 00NUMBER00 but up by 00NUMBER00 versus 00NUMBER00 levels. this is important because it indicates that the decline in iphone sales this year could be mostly due to tough comparisons against 00NUMBER00 levels. besides apple customers are remarkably loyal to the brand and a gargantuan installed based bodes well in terms of renewals going forward. according to tim cookfrom an upgrade perspective during the first half of this year the upgrade rate for the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle two years ago but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iphone 00NUMBER00 which as you know was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. most importantly our customers are incredibly loyal. a recent kantar survey of u. s. smartphone purchasers indicated a 00NUMBER00 loyalty rate the highest ever measured for any smart phone. according to idc numbers apple has a global market share 00NUMBER00 while a huge 00NUMBER00 of all smartphones around the world work with android. this means that even if overall industry growth is slowing down apple still has a lot of room to steal customers away from the competition. tim cook said in the last conference call that apple is attracting record numbers of switchers from android and other platforms and this could be a strong growth driver going forward. we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iphone from android and other operating systems. in fact we added more switchers from android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six month period ever. the smartphone market in the u. s. and other developed countries is highly saturated but things are remarkably different in emerging markets where smartphone penetration levels are still quite low. income levels in many of these countries are also much lower so its hard to tell what levels of market share apple can obtain in these markets over the middle term. however thats no reason to discount the many growth opportunities abroad. apple has recently launched its new iphone se model which sells for a comparatively low starting price of 00NUMBER00 versus a much higher starting price of 00NUMBER00 for the iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone se seems tailor made for capitalizing on growing smartphone demand in emerging markets. according to cook increasing smartphone penetration should generate considerable opportunities for expansion in key emerging markets such as india. with only 00NUMBER00 smartphone penetration of the global handset market today iphone is still attracting millions of first time smartphone buyers each quarter especially from emerging markets. for example in india our iphone sales were up 00NUMBER00 a year ago. only time will tell for certain whether mr. cook is right or wrong about growth prospects in the iphone segment. however between first time smartphone buyers customers switching away from other platforms and renewal sales to current iphone users it looks like apples iconic product still has room for growth. theres something big happening

daily news 00NUMBER00. while investors should take apple supplier rumors with a grain of salt the order is notable if its true with iphone sales declining year over year recently an order of this magnitude could suggest the iphone maker is planning for a smartphone comeback. but is the rumor worth listening toiphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. apple ordered 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million iphone 00NUMBER00 devices according to economic daily news. this is significantly above analyst estimates noted 00NUMBER00 benjamin mayo suggesting management is anticipating a big cycle for the iphone 00NUMBER00. usually launching its new flagship iphone in the second half of september early production orders could preview what management is expecting from sales in late september and in its fiscal first quarter which begins in october. for some context apple sold about 00NUMBER00 million iphone units in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 million units in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. these figures of course represent iphone sales  not orders from apple to its suppliers but reviewing them provides some insight into how meaningful an order of this magnitude really is if  the the order is legit in the first place. but even if this is a real order from apple is it worth reading into while the news is interesting it would be wise for investors not to give apple supply chain rumors like these any weight. apple ceo tim cook has warned investors in the past of relying on reports like this one from economic daily news explaining that they are  not a great proxy for whats going on. while it might be useless to dissect apply supply chain rumors like this one investors dont have to feel as if theyre completely in the dark when it comes to the health of the companys important iphone business. investors can glean some useful context from available information on unit sales history as well as from recent commentary from cook on whos buying iphones. iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. image source apple. perhaps the most concrete evidence suggesting apples iphone business is doing just fine is simply a 00NUMBER00 foot view of sales trends. investors should realize that while iphone unit sales were down 00NUMBER00 year over year in 00NUMBER00 they were up 00NUMBER00 from levels just two years ago. one of the key reasons for year over year declines in iphone sales this year therefore is simply a tough comparison of a monstrous iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle last year. the iphone is still clearly doing very well as evidenced by how much higher sales are than they were two years ago it simply isnt living up to the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. second while cook is obviously prone to bias when it comes to estimating the potential of apples iphone business the ceo did recently provide a solid list of reasons the important segment is still healthy   including a high switching rate from android and other operating systems and a large number of first time smartphone buyers who are choosing iphone. apples iphone business therefore could return to growth later this year as these supply rumors suggest. but its public information and commentary provided directly from apple that makes the best case for this outcome not dubious supply chain rumors. something big just happened    i dont know about you but i always pay attention

iphones made  to meet demand for the foreseeable future. that number would be a two year best. the top 00NUMBER00 sp 00NUMBER00 dividend stocks to buy nowthe iphone in question is presumed to be the iphone 00NUMBER00 which is due to debut in september if the company sticks to its usual iphone launch calendar. wall street had only been anticipating orders for 00NUMBER00 million units with reports of a significant lull in demand for iphone parts and pieces  circulating less than two weeks ago. theres understandable reason to believe the optimistic rumors. one of them is the likely technological leap the iphone 00NUMBER00 is said to make. one chief concern owners of apple stock had voiced more than once is the seemingly small and shrinking differences from one generation of the iphone to the next. that challenge was only exacerbated by theories that the would be iphone market is nearing saturation   as good enough iphones are being held for longer periods rather than being upgraded to newer versions. that could change however if the buzz about the design of the iphone 00NUMBER00 is on target. no less a rumor than the number of iphones apple has ordered the alleged pro version of the iphone 00NUMBER00 have a dual lens camera   which may in turn mean an optical zoom is available. the new pro version is also said to come with a so called smart connector that will allow the lightning port to power attached devices as well as send and deliver digital data. that would be a significant improvement in the functionality of the device. while the premise is compelling owners of apple stock may want to keep in mind that not only are the ramped up numbers an unconfirmed rumor but also theyre not a commitment from apple. the company has recently dialed back its orders. the 00NUMBER00 best index funds to buy right nowthe most recent instance of lowered orders was january of this year underscoring a theory that credit suisse first offered in november. the company did the same in january 00NUMBER00 back its need for the iphone 00NUMBER00 by as much as 00NUMBER00 when the notion of a market saturated by low cost comparable smartphones first took shape. saturation couldnt have been that debilitating though as the iphone 00NUMBER00 sold in record breaking numbers just a couple of years later. point being with order reductions being logged in recently just as often as heroic sales projections have been made such rumors are relatively worthless to investors. traders sure love them though as they create volatility that sets up sizable short term swings. while aapl stock manages to travel the full extent of its trading range on a regular basis it has been speculation far more than actual news from the company doing that driving. thats not apt to change now as traders are ready to be receptive to some positive news after a bearish 00NUMBER00 month dry spell. either way for investors willing to take a step back and look at a multi year chart of apple shares it becomes clear aapl stock has been worth owning far more often than not regardless of the rumors. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned

with a link to an apple inc. aapl    iphone app. get this was all he wrote. the app is called been. it maps catalogs and displays all the countries and states ive visited in my travels through the years and tells me what percentage of the world and the u. s. ive seen so far 00NUMBER00 countries for 00NUMBER00 of the world and 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 of america. outside america the region where ive spent most of my time is europe. ive visited 00NUMBER00 countries or 00NUMBER00 of the continent. ive traveled from northern ireland to eastern romania. from spain to russia turkey to sweden and italy to france to estonia to poland to slovakia greece and beyond. on those journeys ive talked to business executives economists think tank leaders cabbies a few politicians academicians hotel clerks waitresses and entrepreneurs. all of which is why i feel qualified to say to anyone who believes that britain should exit the european union you dont have a clue what youre talking aboutim not really addressing that last comment to most americans. im really addressing it to brits though i know few brits will see this. and if you know any brits feel free to pass this along it needs to be read by those in britain who live under the delusion that life outside the eu will be better. but americans need to understand whats at stake in britains june 00NUMBER00 referendum on remaining in the eu or exiting whats known colloquially as brexit. hillary clinton vs. donald trump which stocks winsee if a majority of brits vote to leave the reverberations will like the old british empire circle the earth and leave behind a good bit of damage and destruction … particularly here in in america where the knock on effects of a brexit vote will hit the american economy by way of the u. s. dollar. first let me say that of all the interviews and conversations ive had in europe in the wake of the european debt crisis the only place i have ever heard anyone tell me their home country would be better off outside the eu was britain. not a single person anywhere else literally not a single person has said life outside the eu would be better. that includes people in greece where i was gathering research  in the run up to the controversial greek vote last summer as well as germany   where much media writing has focused on the anger germans feel toward the greeks and pretty much anyone along the southern periphery of europe. theyve all expressed some level of anger and dissatisfaction with the way the eu operates but to a person theyve conceded the eu is necessary in the modern world. but in britain its different. ive heard a number of people there insist that britain would thrive outside the eu and must flee the eu. maybe its british arrogance. maybe its the fact the brits seem peeved that germany not england is the heart of the european economy. if brits allow that mentality to push them out of the eu well watch out…heres how a brexit likely plays out in big strokesthe global markets immediately question the eus viability given that the u. k. at 00NUMBER00 of the eus aggregate economy is second only to germany in economic heftwhich begets a fall in the value of the euro relative to our u. s. dollar as investors fear that the eu will disintegrate erasing any need for a pan continental currency. britains economic relevancy within europe declines in the short run because trade ties and other contractual obligations are altered and with more than 00NUMBER00 million people the u. k. is a major source of demand and supply for many european countrieswhich also begets a fall in the value of the euro relative to the dollar. a stronger dollar will shrink sales for u. s. manufacturers and exporters since u. s. made goods become expensive relative to similar foreign products. the already tepid u. s. economy weakens. a stronger dollar means the chinese yuan is stronger too since the two remain strongly tiedwhich reduces demand for chinese products globallywhich reduces chinas gdp growthwhich reduces demand for commoditieswhich shrinks commodity country economies and their currencies relative to the dollarwhich piles additional pain onto u. s. exportersslowing the u. s. economy even more and likely leading to a rise in unemploymentwhich prompts the federal reserve to stop talking about interest rate hikes and to instead reopen the quantitative easing playbook. in short what seems like a domestic quarrel between brits who see the wisdom of remaining in the eu and those who dont is at its core a larger threat to the u. s. economy. 00NUMBER00 dividend stocks that have paid investors since the 00NUMBER00 centurygeography aside britain isnt an island unto itself and brits pressing for a brexit would do their country the eu the u. s. and the world economy a great disservice in thinking parochially. i am a long term dollar bear because the financial and monetary fundamentals backing our currency are undeniably heinous and getting worse by the year literally. but in the event the brexit vote carries the day on june 00NUMBER00 youre going to want to show the dollar a lot of love and short the euro the british pound and commodity currencies because they will all struggle. the british shaped the world with their empire and not always for the best. they have a chance to do it again. until next time good

nasdaq aapl has been trying to get its retail stores into india for years but has long been blocked by a sourcing requirement in which at least 00NUMBER00 of a products components must be procured locally within the country. this is a requirement for any single brand retail location that is owned and operated by a foreign entity. earlier this year the indian government said it would consider exceptions to the rule on a case by case basis. earlier this month apple was reportedly  planning on opening three retail stores in the near future alongside a start up incubator. the development office was officially announced days later as ceo tim cook was visiting the country to talk with government officials including prime minister narendra modi. unfortunately indian government officials have decided to stand behind the sourcing requirement. apple wont be getting a pass. reuters  and bloomberg  report that indias finance minister arun jaitley has decided that apple must comply with the local sourcing requirement if it wants to set up shop in the worlds second most populous country. prime minister modi is technically able to overturn jaitleys decision. certain consumer electronics products are eligible for an exception if they are considered state of the art or cutting edge but apple products do not qualify under the guidelines. india has been making a big push toward bolstering its manufacturing economy so it makes some sense why the government is standing by the sourcing requirement. the government is using the requirement as a way to drive foreign capital investments. beyond a possible intervention by modi prominent apple contract manufacturer foxconn announced last year that it was planning to invest 00NUMBER00 billion in india in the coming years to build a new electronics manufacturing facility. at the time it wasnt clear what types of products would be made at the new factory. the plant is expected to employ approximately 00NUMBER00. a few weeks ago the economic times  said that foxconn was about to buy a 00NUMBER00 acre plot of land in maharashtra to build a 00NUMBER00 billion plant exclusively  for apples production needs. this is likely apples best shot at meeting the requirements since it has virtually no component suppliers in india. its unclear if this would allow apple to meet the local sourcing criteria but presumably it would help  a lot. india has always been a tough market for apple to crack into for a wide range of reasons including the retail distribution challenges. cook even bluntly acknowledged recently that iphone prices in india are too high in part due to numerous duties and taxes that are levied on the device. there are plenty of other challenges too including lower average discretionary income and carrier relationships among others. but india has enormous growth potential for apple once the company figures out how to address these hurdles and apple isnt giving up anytime soon. something big

over a 00NUMBER00 year period from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. this podcast was recorded on may 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. chris hill  lets move over to berkshire hathaway. why dont we start with the 00NUMBER00 filing their quarterly filing. well get to the big stakes that berkshire hathaway owns and the degree to which they are increasing or decreasing some of those large stakes. but the headline is that berkshire hathaway is now a shareholder of a little fruit company we like to call apple. all the reports indicate that this was not buffetts call this was. . . was it ted weschler   jason moser  either combs or weschler. i havent read if they named one or the other but i know. . . hill  one of his trusted lieutenants made this purchase. moser  yeah. that makes sense. i think more and more as time goes on were going to see thats generally the case where those two are going to be making probably more of the equity investments. i think buffett and maybe munger to a lesser degree can use their reputation in the business world as perhaps facilitating deals or helping to back deals like theyve done or its being rumored at least that theyre going to do something like that with yahoo. i mean you have these two guys who are younger have maybe a little bit of a different perspective on the world. they invest very similarly to how warren buffett invests. but im sure they probably feel like they have a better grasp on technology than perhaps buffett feels he might which could explain a lot behind this deal. but they have virtually infinite financial resources so they really need to figure out ways to play big ideas and apple is by far one of the biggest. taylor muckerman   kind of fits the mold. didnt they invest in kinder morgan   when kinder morgan sold off. so you see apple selling off quite considerably. so possibly just seeking that value that buffett was known for for the long tenure of his career so far. hill  do we run the risk of trying to read too much into this im just thinking about anyone who is looking at this move. again this is not buffett this is one of his lieutenants. i think it would be understandable for an investor looking at this move to ask the question does this give us a glimpse into the future of berkshire hathaway post warren buffett and im wondering that may be true although do we risk reading too much into that that once buffett for whatever reason is no longer running berkshire hathaway do we see a lot more move in into technology investments or was this just the best use of capital at this time   muckerman   i think with apple its a tech stock yes but its the biggest stock in the world just ahead of google. its not your average small cap mid cap tech stock thats going to be this volatile beast that you dont really understand. its a cash generating machine. it has a dividend now. i dont think its your typical tech stock. it might be a first foray into it really. but i dont think its signaling a significant sea change here. moser  no. and i think probably as time goes on just the way the world changes the way technology moves so fast just that alone berkshire hathaway is more or less going to have to dip a toe into the tech space a little bit more as time goes on. but yeah to taylors point there apple is not your typical tech company. youre buying really one of the most powerful brands on the entire planet. its probably a bit easier for them to look at this and say theyre selling a product. theyre selling phones and tablets and the software that goes with it. its pretty easy business to understand. that said where apple is today versus where it was 00NUMBER00 years ago this is a fundamentally different investment now. this is not like investing in some growth style tech company that could have multibagger status in the next five to 00NUMBER00 years. chances are thats not going to happen. and when you go through the rest of berkshires portfolio you see a lot of those old reliables in there like moodys   and phillips 00NUMBER00 electric   and ibm   and coca cola   and wells fargo. apple i think is the same type of business. and people identify it very much the same way. im a little surprised that given all of the positive sentiment that buffett has offered toward jeff bezos and what hes done in his life with amazon   i really honestly thought maybe we would see berkshire consider initiating a position in amazon because they have a huge position in walmart   and i think a lot of us believe that walmart is sort of the old guard there and amazon is really the new guard when it comes to retail. and again retail is not all that difficult to understand. amazon i would also put in there as a tech company because they are. hill  theyre not paying a dividend though. muckerman   no not quite. moser  thats true but i also if youre asking me which one out performs in the next five years im picking amazon without even thinking twice about it. carl icahn just recently divested from apple saying it was no longer the no brainer that he once said it was. that ultimately is the market. people disagree and you pick a side there. but it seems like they at least feel like theres going to be some kind of an attractive return here in the next few years. muckerman  carl icahn didnt really get what he wanted in terms of activism the higher shareholder returns in terms of a dividend or share buyback. so maybe hes admitting defeat moreso than apple might not be a great stock for the next few years. moser  and he was pegging apple shares at some point in the past year as maybe a double from their current levels. granted that wasnt all organic growth that would share buybacks along with whatever product came in the pipeline there. i think a lot of us felt that was maybe a bit optimistic as well especially when you look at how apple has performed. go back to 00NUMBER00 they initiated the dividend. its not like its out performed the market. it really hasnt. so i would love to see them juice the dividend to little bit. buybacks are fine. and if we happen to see a tax holiday at some point where they can bring some of that cash back home that would probably be a catalyst as well. hill  you mentioned berkshire hathaways stake in wal mart. that is one of the smaller headlines today  when you look at where the investments are and the big investments that berkshire hathaway makes we have seen it disclosed that they have a smaller stake in walmart mastercard   procter gamble. theyve increased their stake in ibm phillips 00NUMBER00. im assuming that the visa  mastercard is not so much that they greatly prefer visa to mastercard. that may have just been simply a slight overweighting issue. its not like att   where they outright eliminated their stake. phillips 00NUMBER00. any insight into the increase in their stake there   muckerman  not really. i mean its one of the bigger downstream companies in the u. s. in the world. it could certainly be a play on the chemical side of the business which chemicals theyre benefiting from low  oil prices   theyre benefiting from low  natural gas prices. i think the growth in what we use chemicals for certainly has a bright future. i think its more along the lines of not gasoline but the other byproducts youre getting out of phillips 00NUMBER00. and theyre putting a lot of money into that business. i think that might be what theyre looking at. and obviously energy has been suffering for a while. so maybe theres a value side to that play as well. the views and opinions expressed herein are the

analysts inability to accurately forecast apple  snasdaq aapl iphone sales. indeed the two phenomena are related. most analysts have been fairly cautious about predicting big changes in the trend of iphone sales growth. however iphone sales growth has exhibited wide swings from year to year. if that remains true in the future analysts iphone sales forecasts will probably continue to miss the mark badly. iphone sales growth has been on a clear downward trajectory over the past five years or so. it has been anything but a smooth descent though. the timing of product launches the addition of new carrier partners and the perceived year to year improvements in the iphone have all contributed to volatile sales growth. fiscal yeariphone unit salesyear over year 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 source apple 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 k reports. as the table above shows year over year growth crashed 00NUMBER00 to about 00NUMBER00 in a single year and slowed to just 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00 before reaccelerating to 00NUMBER00 last year. this increase in growth didnt last. in fact apple is on pace to record a significant year over year drop in iphone sales during fiscal 00NUMBER00. apple analysts havent had much luck in forecasting these wild swings in iphone sales growth. during 00NUMBER00 when iphone growth seemed to be slowing inexorably analysts predicted only a modest acceleration in growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00. even the knowledge that apple was about to launch its first big screen phones didnt entice many analysts to predict big sales gains. iphone sales growth has been very volatile over the past few years. image source apple. thus in sept. 00NUMBER00 most analysts expected apple to sell 00NUMBER00 or fewer iphones in fiscal 00NUMBER00 representing year over year growth of at most 00NUMBER00. iphone sales ultimately grew at twice that rate. analysts couldnt even predict near term sales very well. in mid september wall street analysts expected on average that apple would sell about 00NUMBER00 million iphones  in the following quarter. apple ultimately sold 00NUMBER00 million. even ming chi kuo often lauded as the most accurate apple analyst in the world couldnt accurately predict iphone sales very far ahead. in nov. 00NUMBER00 kuo projected apples 00NUMBER00 iphone sales at 00NUMBER00. that was only 00NUMBER00 short of the actual result but the quarter was already halfway over when he made that prediction. at the same time he estimated that apple would sell 00NUMBER00 million iphones in 00NUMBER00 up 00NUMBER00 year over year. instead apple sold 00NUMBER00 iphones in that quarter. apples remarkable iphone sales growth last year created very tough comparisons for fiscal 00NUMBER00. as a result most analysts correctly expected that iphone sales growth would slow this year. however once again analysts dramatically underestimated the extent of the trend change. last fall most wall street analysts expected that iphone sales would grow at a low single digit range in fiscal 00NUMBER00. some more bullish analysts like katy huberty of morgan stanley   expected high single digit growth. in reality apples iphone sales are on pace to decline about 00NUMBER00 year over year for the full fiscal year. this weak track record indicates that investors shouldnt trust analysts predictions of future iphone sales growth. most apple analysts expect iphone sales to return to growth in 00NUMBER00 but not very rapid growth. for example steve milunovich of ubs  recently forecast that iphone shipments would rise just 00NUMBER00 next year. its certainly possible that apples iphone sales volume wont change much next year. but it also appears that milunovich and many of his colleagues are wary of forecasting strong year over year growth next year when iphone sales are declining sharply just as they didnt forecast steep declines for 00NUMBER00 when iphone sales were soaring at this time last year. apples history over the past few years shows vividly how unwise it is to expect one years sales growth to predict the next years sales growth. given that the iphone installed base has grown by 00NUMBER00 over the past two years and that those phones will start to reach replacement age in fiscal 00NUMBER00 the iphone sales trend could quickly turn from steep declines to strong growth over the next year. something big just happened    i dont know about you but i always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image credit apple. apple  nasdaq aapl has traditionally prided itself on its ability to make its next generation devices thinner and lighter than prior generation devices. apple highlighted this during the iphone 00NUMBER00 as well as during the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus though thinness and lightness gave way to harsh engineering realities in order to include the additional 00NUMBER00 touch functionality to the display the device needed to be made slightly thicker. unsurprisingly apple did not talk at all about the thinness or weight of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at the product launch. according to a new leak via phone arena it appears that apple will again regress in the thickness department with the iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus was 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick both about 00NUMBER00 millimeters thicker than their respective predecessors. the leak republished by phone arena shows that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick while the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will be 00NUMBER00 millimeters thick. in other words iphone 00NUMBER00 gets ever so slightly thicker while the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus stays as thick as the previous model. this is surprising in light of the initial reports from often reliable kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo that stated that iphone 00NUMBER00 would be apples thinnest iphone yet. however in light of the features that apple will need to deliver in order to compel customers to upgrade its not surprising. generally speaking the thicker a device such as a phone tablet etc. is the more power the chip inside can consume while maintaining a target temperature. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple may be interested in providing a large boost in processor performance. this time around apple doesnt have the luxury of using a newer more efficient manufacturing technology relative to what it used to build the 00NUMBER00 chip found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. its the same technology. apple can certainly do work on the design side in order to improve the performancewatt of the chip but in order to deliver a boost in performance that people will care about the idevice maker may have its chip consume more power. pushing performance and power up while making the device materially thinner are two very conflicting goals. additionally i believe that apple will use more sophisticated and potentially higher resolution displays on its next generation iphones. these too will require additional power consumption. in order to make the battery thicker as well as to allow for the device to handle the added heat a thicker device may be required. at the end of the day the performanceaesthetic trade off that apple needs to make is a tricky one. although the company has spent years promoting thinner and lighter devices the reality is that theres far more to the user experience than simply how thin a product is. i would take more performance and a better sharper display over a slightly thinner casing any day. if these leaks are true then apple probably thinks that most of its target customers would prefer that trade off as well. something big just happened    i dont know about you but i always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. motley fool co founder david gardner whose growth stock newsletter was the best performing

picking newsletters over a 00NUMBER00 year period from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. its well known that apple  snasdaq aapl iphones come with just 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage for the base configurations. although this has caused much chagrin among some consumers and smartphone reviewers alike there is a very sensible business reason for this upsell. indeed apple currently offers three storage tiers for its current generation iphones 00NUMBER00 gigabytes 00NUMBER00 gigabytes and 00NUMBER00. for many users the move from 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage to 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage can significantly improve the user experience so they have traditionally been willing to cough up the extra money. the iconic status of the iphone and the general smartphone boom has allowed apple to get away with this pricing scheme. however it looks as though the harsh reality of weaker than expected iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales is forcing apple to pull some additional levers in order to try to boost demand for the coming iphone series. according to a leak from mobipicker via phone arena apples next generation iphones will be offered with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage for the base models. unlike 00NUMBER00 gigabytes which can be pretty uncomfortable these days 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage are likely to prove quite adequate for a good portion of potential iphone customers. i can see this as apples way of trying to court users of older phones with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage if all of the new technologies included in the phone arent enough to justify an upgrade perhaps the idea of additional storage in a state of the art iphone at a typical base price might be enoughincluding 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage in the base model is certainly going to weaken the case for some to move to higher tiers of storage. in fact if apple offers the 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models at the traditional entry level prices and tries to sell 00NUMBER00 models for 00NUMBER00 more the relative value in moving up a tier from base actually looks worse  than it has in previous years. what i expect apple will do in an attempt to drive upsell will be to in fact increase the amount of storage that it offers at each  pricing tier. instead of selling 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models the new lineup could pack 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage. such a product segmentation plan would actually increase  the amount of perceived value that the customer gets in paying the 00NUMBER00 extra since that customer is now getting an 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage space for the money instead of just 00NUMBER00. this would also apply to the very highest tier as well with the customer now getting 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of additional storage for 00NUMBER00 more rather than just 00NUMBER00 gigabytes more. obviously this move has the potential to impact apples blended gross profit margins on iphone. the bill of materials across the board will go up as a result of the added flash memory and apple risks shipping a weaker mix of products as customers that may have previously felt forced to go with the 00NUMBER00 models may now be content with the base 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models. nevertheless even if per unit device margins go down such a move has the potential to drive higher overall unit volumes. apple ultimately needs to maximize total  gross profit dollars during the product cycle and this is a function of both unit volumes and per device margins. apple has no choice but to start accelerating the amount of value it delivers to its customers and eliminating the 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of base storage problem is certainly a good place to start. something big just happened    i dont know about you but i always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip. motley fool co founder david gardner

00NUMBER00 gb iphones not everyone feels the same way. lets be clear as a consumer the practice infuriates me since 00NUMBER00 gb truly isnt a sufficient amount of storage for a modern mobile device. however as a shareholder i greatly appreciate the strategic effects  of the practice since apple has enjoyed a strong increase in iphone average selling prices over the past couple of years due in part to how it prices storage upgrades. well apple might finally cave to the broader consumer pressure and abandon 00NUMBER00 gb iphones. ihs technology analyst kevin wang recently posted on social media that the market researchers supply chain indications show that the next iphone is expected to include 00NUMBER00 gb of ram and start with 00NUMBER00 gb of storage. the current iphone 00NUMBER00 already includes 00NUMBER00 gb of ram but there have been rumors that apple would boost the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 gb of ram to improve performance and multitasking. its worth noting that archrival samsung  already includes 00NUMBER00 gb of ram on numerous galaxy devices. ideally from an investing perspective apple maintains some storage pricing structure that still incentivizes upsells to pricier models. for instance newer ipad models start at 00NUMBER00 gb of storage while offering a comparable upgrade to higher storage capacities. in the ipad customers can quadruple storage to 00NUMBER00 gb for 00NUMBER00. in contrast the base 00NUMBER00 gb iphone storage can be quadrupled 00NUMBER00 gb for 00NUMBER00. so long as the upgrade has a reasonably compelling value proposition such as quadrupling storage then apple should still be able to generate meaningful upgrade activity. apple has tried its best to defend the 00NUMBER00 gb model over the past couple of years pointing to the prominence of cloud services and cloud storage that theoretically reduce the need for local storage. that argument can only go so far though particularly when you consider the presence of a camera capable of capturing 00NUMBER00 video. theres not really an alternative to capturing such high resolution files. additionally ios is a robust 00NUMBER00 gaming platform these days and those games are also pretty hefty in terms of storage requirements. the company has also implemented things like app thinning which allows developers to reduce app sizes by only downloading the specific assets needed for different devices as opposed to downloading the full universal app thats supported across all devices. theres no reason to download app resources that are never used on a given device and app thinning was clearly introduced to improve storage efficiency. but in the end simply increasing the base storage to 00NUMBER00 gb is a simpler route that will address a long standing customer pain point even if apple gives up some asp in exchange. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  an apple store in amsterdam. image source apple. the iphone has been a blessing for apple  nasdaq aapl over the past decade fueling the companys transformation into the biggest and most profitable company in the united states. but even though iphone sales will continue to fill apples coffers for years to come theres reason to believe that its over reliance on this single product will soon be a curse. data source apples 00NUMBER00 k   page 00NUMBER00. warning signs have cropped up over the past year to suggest that the cupertino california based company is either approaching or has already passed this inflection point. most recently in the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 quarterly iphone sales fell on a year over year basis for the first time since the product was introduced in 00NUMBER00. although apple still sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones during the quarter that was down by 00NUMBER00 from the 00NUMBER00 million it sold in the second quarter of 00NUMBER00. the decline was even more dramatic on a sequential basis falling by 00NUMBER00 compared to the first quarter 00NUMBER00 though thats not surprising given that apples fiscal first quarter ended on dec. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and thus included the holiday shopping period. apple ceo tim cook explained that the decline was the result of strong macroeconomic headwinds. growth in the united states is lackluster china has been working to avert a steep economic downturn and europe is still deeply ensconced in its own nascent recovery. but the issue for apple is not just that it sold fewer iphones in the second quarter of the year its also relinquishing market share. apples share of the worldwide smartphone sales fell 00NUMBER00 in the first quarter of 00NUMBER00. that marks a low point for the company. its market share in the same period last year 00NUMBER00. and if you go back to 00NUMBER00 it was as high as 00NUMBER00. data source gartner. this is an ominous sign in a market thats already seen multiple companies rise and fall over the span of a single decade. at different points for instance nokia  and blackberry  sat atop the industry and look where theyre at today. to top things off the drop in iphone sales and market share are particularly problematic given apples lack of revenue diversification. its principal competitor samsung   which currently tops the industry with a 00NUMBER00 share of the worldwide smartphone market sells everything from kitchen appliances to televisions to cameras to smartphones. apple by contrast looked to the iphone for two thirds of its sales last year. apple has other products to be sure but neither its second or third largest product segment is in a position to pick up the slack. sales of ipads its third biggest segment are also declining down by 00NUMBER00 in the latest quarter compared to the year ago period. and while sales of macs have proven to be more resilient than pcs its second largest segment is also experiencing declines down by 00NUMBER00 in the second quarter. in short the future for apple rests now on innovation. the time is coming to an end when it can simply reap what co founder and former ceo steve jobs sowed. whether apple can successfully navigate this challenge remains to be seen but in order to do so it must move beyond its over reliance on the iphone. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the

the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. ever since 00NUMBER00 aapl iphone product cycles have been on a predictable cadence. every other year the company redesigns the device and introduces a new industrial design. in between every other year apple introduces more incremental features or spec bumps within the same overall chassis. its essentially as if apple adopted intel  s famous  tick tock   strategy where the chip giant would move to a smaller manufacturing node every other year while improving performance in between. it looks like apples design cycles might get a little bit longer though. the  nikkei   is exclusively reporting that apple is looking to shift its two year design cycles to three year design cycles. the theory is supported by production schedules that apple has provided to suppliers forecasting lower unit volumes for 00NUMBER00 compared 00NUMBER00 which is corresponds to apples first ever iphone unit decline  that the company just reported. apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones in 00NUMBER00. meanwhile most of the iphone 00NUMBER00 supply leaks that weve been seeing do indeed suggest that the forthcoming device will be very similar to the current iphone 00NUMBER00 in terms of its physical design. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is expected to keep a similar overall shape while tweaking the antenna lines and making the handset negligibly thinner. in terms of new features theres been talk of apple ditching the headphone jack adding better waterproofing capabilities and an improved dual lens camera system. meanwhile theres also been a lot of discussion about whether or not weve reached peak smartphone since the product category has matured so much that theres less innovative potential that hasnt already been realized. as a product category there arent really many bad  phones out there these days irrespective of brand. the same can also be said about the broader market in terms of unit volumes as well. upgrade activity is driven largely as a function of new features and performance improvements so it goes to reason that as less meaningful new features are introduced each year upgrade activity could also slow. that could serve as a counter force to the installment leasing and early upgrade programs that carriers have introduced in recent years which have had the net effect of shortening upgrade cycles. from a resource allocation standpoint it also makes sense for apple to be focusing its efforts on new areas as well. as smartphones mature elongating the design cycles streamlines rd resources. think about laptops which are a very mature but still important category. apple typically redesigns macbooks every four to five years. and yet apples overall rd expenditures continue to rise at a remarkable pace currently approaching 00NUMBER00 billion  over the past four quarters. it seems unlikely that most of those rising costs are going toward the iphone but rather toward areas like an apple car. interestingly enough intel also  recently officially killed the tick tock strategy. however a question remains what do we call the new strategy tick tock. .

playbook. over the past decade there have been no shortage of headlines or prominent examples of the south korean conglomerate borrowing ideas from cupertino. some examples are more blatant than others but samsung has indeed lived up to its fast follower reputation in more ways than one. the somewhat anticlimactic culmination of this trend occurred years ago when apple won a major 00NUMBER00 billion court victory over samsung for patent infringement although the case continues to go through appeals even to this day. ceo tim cook has since pulled back on apples litigation strategy recognizing that the patent lawyers are the only real winners. the iphone maker might soon be looking to add a feature that samsung pioneered first. ihs analyst kevin wang who also recently suggested that apple might finally ditch 00NUMBER00 gb iphones   is now saying that apple will incorporate a dual curve oled display in the 00NUMBER00 iphone. the display might wrap around both the left and right edges of the device much like samsungs new galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge. smartphone oems first experimented with curved displays 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 starting with samsungs galaxy round. samsung has since continued to explore curved displays which makes sense since samsung is one of the biggest proponents of oled displays which are necessary for curved form factors. however the most recent galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge has had a mixed reception. while an improvement over the 00NUMBER00 edges implementation its still questionable how useful a curved display that wraps around the phone really is particularly since curved models cost more than their non curved counterparts. this is an area where apples strength in hardwaresoftware integration will come into play. software ultimately decides how useful the curved portion of the display is. samsung has been trying to add new functionalities to its version of android. the early iterations only allowed users to view certain types of information and now users can access various types of widgets and shortcuts. samsung is extremely good at hardware but less so at software. meanwhile apple excels at both hardware and software although it is admittedly weak on the services front. apple also has a history of innovating new types of intuitive interfaces. if apple can come up with a better use case for the curved edges on a display for 00NUMBER00 then the tech titan might just pull it off. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

using to a much more operationally efficient contract based model that works with manufacturers overseas. taking all those jobs out of the u. s. was part of what allowed apple to grow as it has. in this segment from the  industry focus tech   podcast dylan lewis and evan niu explain the main reasons why the company made the shift and how the contracts work today. also they take a look into apples main parts manufacturer foxconn and the fascinating existence of the campus like foxconn city where many of its employees live. though foxconn is the best known contract manufacturer for apple there are other names you should now know too. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on may 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewis  evan ive seen estimates that roughly 00NUMBER00 of the iphones come from outside the u. s. you think thats about rightevan niu  yeah it sounds about right. i know its a lot very little of it comes from inside the u. s. these days. they have other products that are made here like the mac pro but as far as the iphone goes its mostly abroad yeah. lewis  i dont know how much that really is different than the component breakdown in the past maybe in the early 00NUMBER00 mid 00NUMBER00 for standard consumer tech stuff but one of the major changes that apple underwent really with tim cook was this idea of changing from having their own in house manufacturing their own in house warehouses company owned to moving to this contract manufacturing type relationship. niu  yeah they did that i think in the late 00NUMBER00 or so. they used to make macs in the u. s. in california. they just realized that it was way too expensive in house. a lot of it is also the engineering and manufacturing talent you can get now. because of course a lot of people criticize that they wont bring those jobs back in the u. s. but apples defense nowadays is its not just about low cost labor its also about you dont have as many mid level manufacturing engineers available in the u. s. anymore just because as an economy we dont have as many of those types of jobs. thats not the type of education that we focus on anymore and theres a ton of that over there. including the lower cost labor they have more people that are within the specific skill sets that they need to ramp up the manufacturing. i think a long time ago they said you could fit every single manufacturing engineer within a baseball stadium. in the country thats just how many there are now. over in china foxconn can get hundreds of thousands of engineers within a couple hours if they need them to make some change or tweak some processor. theres a lot of sides to the story why they do it like that. lewis  this pivot this decision by the business to go to this contract manufacturing relationship. it was really something that tim cook pushed aggressively. for all the praise that steve jobs gets as this design branding user experience mastermind. this is where tim cooks expertise really is in operational efficiency and just running a business extremely well from a supply chains point of view. he has really pushed the business to where they are now where they rely heavily on foxconn and pegatron to name two as these contract manufacturers. listeners just so you have an idea if you dont know what this term means. basically apple doesnt own any of the facilities where iphones are being assembled. niu  well they own let me just add in that they own a bunch of the manufacturing tooling and the equipment. a lot of their capital expenditures these days are they buy the actual infrastructure and the gear and then they put that inside of the facilities that they dont own. they kind of own a lot of the stuff and foxconn owns the factory and then they hire the people and then they operate that stuff. i mean their capex is like 00NUMBER00 million yuan which is insane. majority of that goes to this product tooling that sits in asia inside a factory facility. lewis  yeah. im glad you hopped in and clarified there. but largely theyre paying these manufacturers to put together their devices and then ship them over rightniu  right. lewis  foxconn is the name that you will hear the most and when you hear that name you often think of foxconn city. which is the companys largest manufacturing plant and thats in shenzhen china. so chances are if youre holding an iphone or listening to this episode on an iphone it was put together in china. on that one campus alone and when i say campus i mean that thats kind of the vibe that you get looking around. if you ever see pictures of this setup its incredible. they have hundreds of thousands of employees working there. its over a square mile and they have dorms for employees its own shopping center i think they have their own cable network there. the executives there are likening it to this college experience i think its kind of a stretch. you have people working 00NUMBER00 hour days 00NUMBER00 days a week putting together iphones. that one foxconn city location is just one of the 00NUMBER00 that the company has in china. actually folks following tech might have heard earlier this week foxconn announced it automated 00NUMBER00 in one of its factories. going back to that idea of providing some of the tooling im sure apple had something to do with that. niu  yeah i wonder if they helped fund some of that affair. if theyre going to be using those robots for primarily iphone production it would make sense that apple helped them pay for some of that. lewis  yeah. we dont have firm details on that but it wouldnt be a stretch by any means. niu  right. lewis  more recently apple added pegatron thats a name i mentioned earlier as another contract manufacturer. i think this was maybe 00NUMBER00 or so 00NUMBER00. i think there were two big reasons for this. one of them was diversification to downplay the risk of relying solely on one contract manufacturer so heavily like foxconn. i think maybe another was in a response to the companys increasingly complex fragmented product offering. they wanted to have that split among a couple different suppliers just because of some of the specialization required to produce the different sizes and models and form factors. if youre listening to this show on an iphone chances are it started out in a foxconn or pegatron factory most likely in china which i think of as a testament to the growth and diversification strategy among their contract manufacturers. recently theyve added another taiwan based company to this list wistron. just another thing to keep an eye out for. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  in the 00NUMBER00 tim cook shifted apple  nasdaq aapl to an incredibly efficient contract based manufacturing model. in this segment from the  industry focus tech    podcast dylan lewis and evan niu talk about why  outside of the obvious reason of reduced labor costs the company made that move. find out just how efficient apples supply chain is compared to its competitors how much flexibility this model allows the company and how long it takes for the company to clear inventory of each model. dylan and evan also talk about some of the very real risks associated with the contract model from quality control to concerns about working conditions and the risks associated with putting that much of your intellectual property in another companies hands. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on may 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewis  evan any thoughts on why they do this beyond just the very conventional cost because its cheaper to outsource production to some of these countries where labors a little bit cheaperevan niu  i think part of it is that in addition to the engineering talent thing i was talking about earlier tim cook absolutely hates inventory. setting up this model and supply chain ive read reports where other industry executives look at apple supply chain and theyre just blown away. theyre like well we cant compete with this. you can order a custom built apple device like a mac or an iphone or something. youll get the tracking information and it literally ships from the factory to your doorstep in a matter of days. they build it and they ship it directly to you. thats the kind of scenario when the purchase transaction goes like that. i mean apple does very little hands on. apples not physically handling the product too much if youre ordering like that and thats kind of a testament because they still get to book all the revenue and all the sales. it goes from a contract manufacturer to a third party shipping company directly to a customer. with that happening all so quickly their inventory turnover times are so insanely high that its comparable to fast food restaurants and stuff like that instead of 00NUMBER00 dollar smartphones. i think thats been a huge boon to apple because that just makes the whole operation a lot more efficient. its this huge strength because again other companies have seen this and theyre like we cant do that. we cant set it up this seamlessly and streamline to this point where is incredibly efficient and direct. of course they have to have a lot of inventory for retail stores and things like that. theyre very good in inventory management they keep it really lean. otherwise having a lot of inventory is not really a good thing because it just sits there and risks getting written down if you cant sell it and if you have too much its just kind of a big pain. thats why tim cook has really pursued this path so aggressively. lewis  to your point while i was researching this show i came across this stat that the flip to contract manufacturing took the amount of time that inventory sat on apples balance sheet from months to days. you talk about that inventory turnover and actually this is something that vincent shen alluded to when he did the consumer goods episode of industry focus   talking about industry turnover apples got the best in the business. its because inventory sits on their balance sheet for such a short amount of time. niu  mm hmm yep. lewis  i think beyond that theres also a little bit more manufacturing flexibility abroad. i think some of these contract manufacturers are ready to go and they can get things set up very quickly. they have the talent in place to within two weeks really be up and running. niu  thats another thing. if you had these really big demands and you need to be able to scale up and down depending on seasonality and these other factors. thats another big benefit of this contract manufacturing model because you can just say i need x number of units go build them. whereas if youre doing the manufacturing yourself you also have to worry about things like excess capacity capacity utilization. lets say you need to ramp down for whatever reason which makes a lot of sense now with the iphone just finally declining for the first time. just in general to have that ability to this lever of being able to increase production as needed without really worrying to much about the logistics of personnel. like hiring laying off which is something companies that have a lot of manufacturing footprint have to constantly worry about how theyre going to manage increasing and decreasing production. particularly when it comes to hiring and laying off workers which is a tough thing to do and theyre kind of outsourcing that responsibility in a way too. lewis  yeah. of course this approach is not without its own risks right for as much as we praise apples operational smarts here there are some issues with the model. one of them namely i think is control right we havent seen a ton of this but there is the possibility of quality control being a problem. i think more when you think about foxconn and some of the contract manufacturers in asia theres always this worry about working conditions and this is something that has gotten a lot of press in the last couple years. theres always this concern of working conditions being substandard of being overly demanding of overtime being required things like that. thats definitely one of the risks here. niu  yeah i definitely agree there. lewis  one of the other ones that immediately comes to mind for me is just intellectual property risk too. i think you cant go more than a couple weeks without seeing online leaked photos of some rumored iphone design or configuration. i think thats a byproduct of these contract manufacturing systems. when you have all these intermediaries within the design and fulfillment its just bound to happen somewhere. niu  with as global as apples business has become the supply chain is just too massive. you cant keep it secret. theres just too many moving parts theres too many third parties involved. everyone wants a piece of it and wants to know. you can easily sell a picture of a leaked iphone and get paid a ton of money if you can smuggle it out. youll risk losing your job but i mean for some of these workers theres actually a lot of upside to sneaking these things out. they know how much appetite the media has for it. lewis  i wonder how much the company really minds that that happens. niu  well i know that theyve punished workers that have been caught doing this. its pretty severe punishment i dont remember exactly what it was. obviously apple is such a huge contract for them and they have all these confidentiality agreements and all these things like that. i do think that foxconn does care they do try to do their best to stop it. again when youre talking at this scale all it takes is one person to get a picture prototype or molding or something out and you have a headline. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  investorplace investorplace  stock market news stock advice trading tipssince the first iterations of the iphone apple inc. aapl    has operated on a fairly regular schedule with one major upgrade coming every other year. now according to japanese news site nikkei   aapl is stretching out that cycle from two years to three in the face of a slowing smartphone market. i think its a smart move. the smartphone market has become oversaturated and iphone sales have grown more and more sluggish as a result. in fact aapl reported its first ever drop in sales in the first quarter a whopping 00NUMBER00 plunge to 00NUMBER00 million units from 00NUMBER00 million units the same quarter last year. one recent criticism is that each new iteration only offers a few small tweaks fingerprint identification better touch sensitivity and a new spot for the audio jack but nothing interesting enough to convince most consumers to upgrade. from what weve heard about it already this years iphone 00NUMBER00 will likely suffer from the same issue. we can look forward to new dual speakers and a dual camera system but i think sales will be relatively lackluster given the rumors of a complete redesign for the 00NUMBER00 iphone. ceo tim cook has hinted at the removal of the home button an edge to edge display and other new features for next years model which may entice consumers to save their money and ignore this years lineup entirely. 00NUMBER00 great stocks that will make a splash this summerin the meantime no one expects apple to top the 00NUMBER00 million iphones sold in 00NUMBER00. this will be the first time annual sales failed to beat the year prior. this all sounds like bad news but the truth is aapl is still a great company. its the dominant player in the cell phone industry generates a lot of free cash flow has a very strong balance sheet and is relatively cheap at 00NUMBER00 september 00NUMBER00 earnings per share estimates or even lower when you remove the companys excess cash with growth all but guaranteed in the long term. but i think some enthusiasts including warren buffett are underestimating the profit pressure apple will feel in the coming years. the slower replacement cycle and less differentiated technology will lead to more competition and pressure on apples gross profit margins which at 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 are very high for a hardware company. and while the bulls like to talk about the growth of aapls services business which includes apple music its only 00NUMBER00 of the current revenue base and may have trouble compensating for the decline in the companys large computer hardware gross margin base. switching to a three year upgrade cycle gives apples developers more time to innovate and more time for consumers to shake off their phone fatigue. if aapl can find a way to keep its lineups feeling fresh it shouldnt have any problem holding its throne at the top of the smartphone market. but no one should expect the same explosive growth we saw back when aapl stock was just a few years old. hilary kramer is the editor of   gamechangers    breakout stocks under 00NUMBER00 octane trader   absolute

consistently one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at stock options channel is apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the june 00NUMBER00 expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the june 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of

a new recent low of 00NUMBER00 on may 00NUMBER00 following a downbeat earnings report and news that carl icahn had exited his entire position in  apple stock. since then however aapl has been quietly sneaking higher with the stock now up over 00NUMBER00 since then to close at 00NUMBER00 on monday. unfortunately the rally is likely to run into trouble at these levels and aapl stock likely will consolidate and pull back slightly over the coming weeks. from a technical perspective apple had rallied to trade into the post earnings gap 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 as seen in the aapl stock chart below. there is also some additional major overhead resistance at the 00NUMBER00 level as well. click to enlargeapple shares also have been performing stride for stride with the sp 00NUMBER00 the

apple. vrx buy the earnings plunge in valeant stocklow levels of implied volatility also make long volatility option strategies very viable. so while i think the rally in aapl shares may likely stall i expect the pullback to be fairly shallow given attractive price to earnings multiple 00NUMBER00 and dividend yield 00NUMBER00. i am also certainly less bearish than i was in my last article  on apple when aapl stock was trading around the 00NUMBER00 level. so to position for a consolidation period in aapl consider this tradebuy the aapl july 00NUMBER00 puts expire 00NUMBER00 and sell the aapl june 00NUMBER00 puts expire 00NUMBER00 for a 00NUMBER00 net debit. these are both the regular monthly options. the maximum risk on the trade is 00NUMBER00 per spread. ideally aapl stock closes near the 00NUMBER00 level at june expiration for the maximum potential gain. make sure to close out the trade if aapl is below 00NUMBER00 on june expiration to avoid any possible assignment risk. as

goes. the mac makers large and growing cash hoard is a source of endless speculation about what apple should or shouldnt buy. the latest instance is business insider  s transportation editor matt debord who believes that apple should scoop up uber. its basically a given that apple is exploring transportation electric cars and mobility. theres been way too much hiring activity for apple not  to be looking into these areas. but just in case there was any question about it the 00NUMBER00 billion investment  in chinese ride hailing service didi chuxing should put those doubts to rest. debord believes that acquiring uber would allow apple to jump to the head of the pack since uber is the market leader in many ride hailing markets. in addition it could help prevent a future potential downround for uber where it raises capital at a lower valuation than the prior round. that could help stabilize the current status of unicorn valuations too says debord. with respect i must disagree. heres why. first and foremost uber is insanely expensive. just last week the company raised 00NUMBER00 billion in fresh cash from saudi arabias public investment fund. the deal valued the ride hailing start up at a massive 00NUMBER00 billion unchanged sequentially from a 00NUMBER00 billion venture capital funding round from december. adding a take out premium will push that figure much higher  at least 00NUMBER00 billion by debords estimation. he rightly points out that much of apples cash is locked overseas and would be subject to hefty repatriation taxes if brought home to fund an acquisition. that would add a cool 00NUMBER00 to the total bill but debord suggests that apple should fund the deal with stock. the challenge is that with apple shares trading in the neighborhood of 00NUMBER00 that would require issuing 00NUMBER00 million fresh shares representing nearly 00NUMBER00 dilution compared to the current 00NUMBER00 billion shares outstanding. issuing 00NUMBER00 million shares would also eliminate virtually all of the accretive benefits of apples share repurchase program over the past four years. specifically apple has retired nearly 00NUMBER00 billion shares of stock since the capital return program was initiated in 00NUMBER00 to significant earnings accretion over time. investors wont want to give most of that back. besides 00NUMBER00 billion would be over 00NUMBER00 times greater than apples largest acquisition to date beats for 00NUMBER00 billion which itself was six times larger than the previously largest acquisition ever. the vast majority of apple acquisitions are under 00NUMBER00 million although ceo tim cook has recently suggested that apples acquisitions may go higher as it does not want to be limited by price if the deal makes sense. on top of all of this i tend to believe that uber is grossly overvalued to begin with. leaked documents from earlier this year suggest that the company generated around 00NUMBER00 million in net revenue in the first half of 00NUMBER00 leading to nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in net losses. another idea is that apple could save the unicorns in silicon valley right now by stepping in with a blockbuster acquisition. an uber downround could put many private start up valuations at risk. not only is the trend of private valuations not apples problem but a decline in start up valuations would actually benefit the company. apple acquires a company every three to four weeks and often only cares for technology and talent. the company generally has no interest in buying revenue streams so declining valuations would reduce the price tag for many potential acquisitions. uber also has a reputation for being a somewhat unethical company most recently exemplified by its leasing program xchange. on the other hand apple is generally a very ethical company that genuinely wants to help the greater good. thats an obvious culture clash. time and time again uber has shown an active disdain for essentially all forms of regulation that could hinder its growth even common sense regulations that are intended for consumer safety. the company along with rival lyft just recently voluntarily pulled out of austin texas because it lost a regulatory fight over fingerprint based background checks for drivers. uber has been sued in countless cities and countries around the world for operating illegally. apple would never operate like this actively defying laws and regulations put in place for consumer protection. considering its massive global business and brand apple adheres to all relevant laws and regulations in the markets that it participates in and the regions where it operates. another clash of values. as a longtime shareholder id be severely disappointed if apple even considered buying uber. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

the energy market   00NUMBER00. the company had created a subsidiary named apple energy llc that is based in delaware. this subsidiary will be ran from aapls headquarters in cupertino calif. and will

order a private car. but in china these services have all gotten blurred together thanks to a company called didi chuxing. didi offers all of those services as well as a way to test drive new cars to users in about 00NUMBER00 cities across china through a variety of mobile apps. you could call it the uber of china but that would be doing didi a huge disservice. the company cleared 00NUMBER00 last year alone more than uber has ever done. and didi has about 00NUMBER00 million customers and serves up 00NUMBER00 million rides every day. the latest data available pegs ubers daily rides at 00NUMBER00 million. but while didi is massively popular among chinese riders its still trying to find its footing in generating positive revenue. the company earns most of its money via its private ride hailing app which brought in 00NUMBER00 million in revenue in the first five months of 00NUMBER00 to the financial times. but didi had an estimated loss of 00NUMBER00 billion last year. that loss actually was a combination of losses from didi dache and kuaidi dache which merged last year into what is now didi chuxing the former companies were owned by alibaba  and tencent holdings   respectively after duking it out in the shared mobility space for a time they decided theyd be better off if they joined forces. theres a reason didi doesnt appear worried about its lagging revenue the company expects to hold 00NUMBER00 of the 00NUMBER00 billion private car hailing market by 00NUMBER00. the company has been busy securing some major funding recently to achieve that huge 00NUMBER00 goal. apple  nasdaq aapl     invested 00NUMBER00 billion in the company just last month in a move that puts didis valuation at around 00NUMBER00 billion. apple is eager to get into the ride sharing space   and its sizable investment in didi proves just how important chinas transportation service is to the company. apple is rumored to be working on its own vehicle and some of the latest reports say apple is looking to release a vehicle for the shared mobility market. that makes the investment from apple all the more intriguing. according to morgan stanley  analyst katy huberty apple could earn 00NUMBER00 billion from the 00NUMBER00 mobility market by 00NUMBER00. with such a large market and didi already the largest player both companies have a lot to gain. aside from its vast system of transportation services didi has also ventured into the auto loan business earlier this year as part of a partnership with china merchants bank. the company is focusing on securing car loans for its drivers who might otherwise have a difficult time buying vehicles. that also opens up the possibility of the company eventually extending loans to its large pool of app users as well. and didi is using its investments to ensure that it remains the dominant mobile transportation service in china. the company recently invested 00NUMBER00 billion to boost its efforts to fight off ubers expansion into its domestic market. its likely youll be hearing a lot more about didi chuxing in the future particularly now that apples backing the company and helping to building its technology platform. didis dominance in china is already clear and its showing no signs of slowing down. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something

keynote to make some announcements. heres what investors can expect from the event. apple ceo tim cook at an apple event. image source apple. apple investors and customers probably shouldnt get excited about seeing any new products. this year rumors point to an event strictly focused on software. new versions of ios os x watchos and tvos are expected to be introduced during mondays keynote according to 00NUMBER00 wwdc rumor roundup. heres a summary of some of the most interesting rumors ahead of the eventa siri sdk  perhaps one of the most prominent rumors is that the apple voice assistant siri may get a software development kit or sdk which will enable the voice assistant to work with third party apps in more integrated ways. macrumors explainsdevelopers will be able to build siri integration into their apps allowing siri to access data and perform tasks within apps. third party app access has the potential to greatly expand what siri is capable of and could put the personal assistant on par with more robust solutions like google now. siri for mac  siri is widely expected to finally come to os x which would mean mac users would finally have access to siri on their mac devices. updates for watchos and tvos  rumors about specific features that may come to watchos or tvos havent gained any traction ahead of the event but apple does promise on its website that attendees will learn about the future of these operating systems so there certainly will be new features announced. apples iphone sales represent well over half the companys sales and an even greater portion of its profits. with growth coming to a halt and even becoming negative in the companys most recent quarter apples progress in software is becoming increasingly important. without the iphone serving as a catalyst for revenue growth investors are relying on apple to continue improving software in a way that both keeps customers loyal and better monetizes them. apple recently acknowledged the growing importance of software and services by introducing a new metric it calls installed base related purchases. this metric accounts for revenue from services like itunes apple music apple pay and apps. apple app store. image source apple. apples installed base related revenue increased 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 to the year ago quarter. in comparison apples iphone revenue declined 00NUMBER00 during the same period. improved user interfaces in the companys operating systems and applications running these services is critical to driving apples installed base related purchases higher. apples wwdc keynote will take place on monday morning 00NUMBER00 am pst at the bill graham civic auditorium in san francisco. the event will be streamed live on applecom and on apple devices. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

click here. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple  nasdaq aapl stock recently found favor with legendary investor warren buffetts berkshire hathaway. in may an sec filing revealed berkshire had invested 00NUMBER00 billion into apple stock. while im sure there are a number of reasons berkshire decided apple was a quality investment id guess the tech giants dividend was one of the main factors. since apple reinitiated a dividend in 00NUMBER00 the company has worked its way into the ranks of some of the most prominent dividend names. heres exactly why i love apples dividend. image source getty images. apples dividend yield hasnt always been meaningful but the stocks approximate 00NUMBER00 decline in the past 00NUMBER00 months has boosted apples dividend yield to meaningful levels. the companys dividend yield which is defined as dividends paid out per share in the past 00NUMBER00 months divided by the stock price is at 00NUMBER00 today far higher than the dividend yield of 00NUMBER00 a year ago. sure a 00NUMBER00 dividend yield isnt high enough to get income investors jumping out of their seats but its at least meaningful after the stocks decline. but apple makes up for what it lacks in dividend yield in the next two points. income investors are just as concerned with sustainability as they are with dividend yields. after all what good is a high dividend yield if investors cant say with some certainty that they expect the dividend to still be around in five to 00NUMBER00. apples dividend scores an a plus for sustainability. a cash rich balance sheet heady cash flow loyal customer base and a low payout ratio mean the tech giant can continue paying out its dividend even in the face of significant headwinds. for instance apple has generated a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion in free cash flow or cash from operations less capital expenditures during the past 00NUMBER00 months. of this monstrous stream of free cash flow apple paid out just 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends during this period. image source apple. the commonly used payout ratio metric which equals dividends paid in the trailing 00NUMBER00 month period as a percentage of earnings also illustrates how apple has ample wiggle room in terms of dividend payouts. apples payout ratio is just 00NUMBER00 much lower than payout ratios of many popular  dividend stocks   which are often well over 00NUMBER00. apple has increased its dividend every single year since 00NUMBER00. and management has every intention to continue doing this for years to come. in 00NUMBER00 apple issued a press release informing investors of the companys plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis. the move solidified apples appeal to dividend investors. and the increases to apples dividend have been substantial averaging about 00NUMBER00 annually. this year apple increased its quarterly dividend per share from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 or from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 on an annual basis. this represents a 00NUMBER00 increase  about in line with the companys average dividend hike 00NUMBER00. combining apples meaningful dividend yield its likelihood to persist for years to come and managements commitment to continue increasing the dividend on an annual basis apple is a great stock for investors looking for reliable and growing dividend payouts. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

receives sp capital iqs 00NUMBER00 stars strong buy ranking. apple has been criticized in recent years for its lack of innovation and wall street has punished the stock over the last year in reaction to slowing iphone sales growth. apples newest iphone models are due to launch later this year and we should see some clues as to what to expect on the new devices. in addition to information regarding the new iphones developers will also look for upgrades to the companys operating system and upgrades to apple watch. it is also possible that the company will unveil an android version of imessage which will give android users access to one of apples most popular features. if the company can excite wall street with its new products and software expect enthusiasm to return and shares to regain more of its recent losses. if you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on aapl consider an august 00NUMBER00 bull put credit spread for a 00NUMBER00 cent credit. thats a potential 00NUMBER00 return 00NUMBER00 annualized and the stock would have to fall 00NUMBER00 to cause a problem. if you want to take a bearish stance on the stock at this time consider an august 00NUMBER00 bear call credit spread for a 00NUMBER00. thats a potential 00NUMBER00 return 00NUMBER00 annualized and the stock would have to rise 00NUMBER00 to cause a problem. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc. originally published on investorsobservercom earlier this week consumer intelligence research partners released a report showing that u. s. iphone users have been holding on to their phones longer. at first this new data point would seem to support apple  nasdaq aapl bears contention that iphone sales have peaked. a growing number of investors think the iphones best days are over. image source apple. however one notable aspect of the cirp report is that while the iphone upgrade rate is slowing its not slowing quickly. given how rapidly the iphone user base has grown in the past couple of years this suggests that iphone sales growth could be on the verge of accelerating again at least for a little while. over the past few years cirp has collected data on how frequently u. s. iphone users replaced their devices. three years ago nearly two thirds of the iphones being upgraded in the u. s. were two years old or less. as of last quarter the comparable figure was only 00NUMBER00. in other words more people are hanging on to their phones for two to three years or more. in total cirp estimates that over the past three years the average age of iphones being replaced in the u. s. has increased by about three months. explaining the study results cirp co founder josh lowitz stated   the rate of change in iphone features has slowed. in addition phone financing plans now encourage iphone owners to hold on to their current phone. . . this motivator appears to outweigh the impact of any early upgrade options that carriers offer with the new financing plans. . . the slowdown in iphone upgrades might seem to support the bearish tone struck by many apple analysts. a growing number of analysts expect iphone sales to shrink again in the upcoming 00NUMBER00 year following a roughly 00NUMBER00 decline in fiscal 00NUMBER00. even the more bullish analysts are just hoping for iphone sales to return to the fiscal 00NUMBER00 level next year. however this pessimism may be an overreaction to the slowing upgrade rate. after all a three month increase in the upgrade cycle over a three year period is a slow trend not a radical shift. the total impact of this three month slowdown in the upgrade cycle would likely be a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 reduction in annual iphone sales holding all else equal. obviously cirps data only covers the u. s. market but the trends are probably directionally similar in other countries around the world. contrast the gradual slowdown in iphone upgrade rates to the rapid growth of the global iphone user base. in april apple ceo tim cook stated that the iphone installed base had grown by 00NUMBER00 the past two years. much of that growth came during 00NUMBER00 following the launch of the hugely successful iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the iphone is still growing in popularity. image source the motley fool. all else equal an 00NUMBER00 larger user base would mean an 00NUMBER00 in iphone replacements. a slower replacement rate would reduce that figure somewhat. the increased availability of used iphones in good condition will also allow some consumers especially in emerging markets to upgrade their iphones from time to time without ever buying a brand new device. still given just how much the iphone user base has grown since 00NUMBER00 its quite likely that the number of iphones upgraded during fiscal 00NUMBER00 will exceed the previous high hit last year. and assuming that apple makes some big improvements for the 00NUMBER00 iphone coming in 00NUMBER00 the number of upgrades should jump again in fiscal 00NUMBER00. while upgrades now drive the majority of apples iphone sales the iphone platform is still drawing in lots of new users. the number of people switching to the iphone from android is at a record high. there is plenty of room for smartphone ownership to rise in emerging markets too. both of those trends support the continued growth of apples iphone installed base. as a result iphone sales will likely rise by double digits in fiscal 00NUMBER00 as iphone user base growth more than offsets a slower upgrade cycle. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 or whatever comes after the iphone 00NUMBER00 lives up to the hype apple will be in line for another year of double digit growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00. at some point growth of the iphone user base will moderate. when that happens further slowing of the upgrade cycle could lead to peak iphone. luckily for apple investors that point is still probably several years in the future. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

consumer. instead the payment service was specifically designed to save retailers money. credit card transaction processing fees of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 add up quickly particularly for low margin retailers. a consortium of retailers led by wal mart  and including dozens of other companies thought that by creating a payment system based on ach transfers and direct debits from bank accounts they could all save a ton of money. the actual payment experience for the consumer offered little benefit. you would use your phone to scan a qr code on the cashiers terminal which would then debit your account accordingly while bypassing traditional credit card networks. spoiler alert if your goal is consumer adoption then this is the wrong starting point. its a big behavioral ask to have consumers move away from an already easy process purely for the sake of your own bottom line. in contrast apple  nasdaq aapl saw an opportunity to improve the mobile payment experience strengthened with biometric authentication in the form of touch id. the hurdle of improving the traditional card swipe has always been quite high because lets face it  swiping takes you 00NUMBER00 seconds. but apple has delivered a compelling solution with apple pay and the mac maker continues to work on bringing the service to more and more countries around the world. and while apples economic model for apple pay is very viable   apple pay is not intended to be a stand alone profit center. rather the service is intended to make life easier for consumers while helping sell iphones as a useful feature. it should come as no surprise then that currentc now appears to be dead. the company has informed its early beta testers that it will no longer be accepting new transactions and user accounts will soon be disabled too. this comes shortly after the official currentc launch was postponed while currentc began laying off employees. many of currentcs retail backers have recently started to embrace apple pay and other mobile payment alternatives instead an apparent acknowledgement that currentc is a lost cause. wal mart even recently announced its own service wal mart pay in december seemingly acquiescing to the reality of the payment industry by supporting the traditional card networks. currentc never stood a chance. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech

since renamed macos and ios 00NUMBER00. but as apple aapl begins to realize the power of its services the biggest announcement of the keynote is apple has finally embraced imessage as a platform having opened it up to take on the likes of facebook messenger snapchat and more. apple included a host of new features for imessage as part of ios 00NUMBER00 which will be available for public beta in july and as a free download to all in the fall. packed into the new imessage are features such as making emojis three times larger predicting when you want to use emojis and things like having hand written messages bubble effects including the ability to make messages invisible until someone swipes right on the message and much more. apple has also opened up imessage to third party apps allowing developers to create stickers or send money through imessage via square cash showing the true power of apples messaging platform in its quest to focus on services. also included are things like order

messenger the most popular messaging app in the west has over 00NUMBER00 million monthly active users while snapchat has recently surpassed 00NUMBER00 million monthly active users according to a

getting increasingly intense for investors in the tech juggernaut lately. apple stock  is down by 00NUMBER00 in the last year mostly because of fears about slowing revenue growth. while the bulls are pounding the table on the basis that apple is spectacularly undervalued at current price levels the bears highlight the fact that sales are moving in the wrong direction. adding to the drama two of the most successful investors in financial history have diametrically opposed opinions on apple stock. warren buffetts berkshire hathaway  nyse brk a nyse brk b recently bought nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in apple. on the other hand activist investor carl icahn has completely liquidated his position in the company. investors need to take this kind of information with a grain of salt. professional money managers can make mistakes just like anyone else. in fact they often do. its of utmost importance to understand the rationale behind a buy or sell decision so you should always do your own homework as opposed to blindly replicating the investment decisions of others no matter how famous and successful. nevertheless looking at a company such as apple from the perspective of investing superstars like buffett and icahn can be quite an enlightening exercise. icahn and buffett have different investment philosophies and they make decisions with different considerations in mind. icahn is an activist investor while buffett is famous for investing in rock solid companies for the long term. activist investors typically take a big position in a company and then they push for changes and initiatives that can increase shareholder value. when it comes to apple in particular icahn published a letter to ceo tim cook in may 00NUMBER00 saying he considered apple stock undervalued by as much as 00NUMBER00 and that the company should capitalize on the opportunity to aggressively repurchase stock at conveniently low prices. apple has repurchased tons of stock since then although probably not as much as icahn would have liked. as for his selling decision icahn explained in a recent interview with cnbc that he still believes apple is a great company and that the stock is attractively priced. however he decided to sell apple because of increasing concerns about the companys performance in china. the economy in china is decelerating and the smartphone market in the country is clearly slowing down. apple reported a big 00NUMBER00 revenue decline from the greater china region last quarter amounting to 00NUMBER00 billion or 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. icahn also said in the interview that he realized material gains on his apple investment as the stock delivered a gain 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 in nearly two and a half years. icahn is not particularly focused on investing for the long term and he probably believes he can find more profitable alternatives somewhere else. when it comes to berkshire hathaways recent purchase of apple the only thing we know for certain is that buffett explained in an email to the wall street journal  that one of his investing lieutenants either todd combs or ted weschler made the decision. buffett has traditionally stayed away from tech companies because he considers the sector too dynamic and unpredictable but apple offers many of the characteristics buffett appreciates in a business. to begin with apple is one of the most valuable brands in the world which provides a crucial source of competitive advantage in the industry. the company has unquestionable financial strength. apple has a pristine balance sheet with nearly 00NUMBER00 in cash and liquid investments and the business generates massive amounts of cash on a regular basis. apple is also priced at incredibly low levels the stock trades at a price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 versus an average price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 for companies in the sp 00NUMBER00 index. even if buffett didnt pick apple himself he did pick combs and weschler to make investment decisions with berkshire hathaways money under clearly defined investing principles. when considering competitive advantage financial strength and valuation its not too hard to understand why apple is now part of berkshire hathaways portfolio. at the end of the day its not about who is right or wrong. icahn and buffett are playing different games and the fact that one is selling while the other one is buying apple stock shouldnt be a big reason for concern. it all comes down to your own investing philosophy and your vision of the future for apple. im a big fan of buffetts approach of investing in high quality businesses for the long term. apple fits that description quite well so im not planning to sell my apple stock anytime soon. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. the views and opinions

invested 00NUMBER00 billion in the china based ride hailing company  didi chuxing. apple is looking to expand its role in the automotive space by building its own electric car by 00NUMBER00 and the investment shows that it clearly sees promise in ride hailing services. but apple isnt the only one. chinaa largest state owned insurer china life insurance just poured 00NUMBER00 million into didi as well. china life is starting to become a connoisseur of ride hailing investments as the company has also invested uberchina recently. the latest round of didi chuxings investments have now 00NUMBER00 billion putting the companys valuation at around 00NUMBER00. and its going to need that cash to help fend off ubers worldwide expansion. theres plenty of competition between uber and didi though didi has a complete lineup of transportation services including a taxi hailing service ride sharing bus tickets private ride hailing and even new car test drives. didis footprint in china reaches 00NUMBER00 cities across the country with 00NUMBER00 million customers and completes 00NUMBER00 million rides every day. all this makes didi a dominant force in the chinese ride sharing market. but china is becoming increasingly important to uber as well. the company recently received a 00NUMBER00 billion investment from saudi arabias public investment fund and part of the money will go to uberchina operations. while uber has expanded its presence worldwide didi has mainly made investments in other ride hailing services in other countries. the company has invested in ubers u. s. rival lyft and a taxi service app called grab in southeast asia. didi chuxing is betting that the future of chinas transportation and possibly the rest of the worlds is in shared mobility services. thats because ride hailing and ride sharing could see a surge in usage as autonomous cars begin hitting the road. morgan stanley analyst katy huberty said apple is looking to shared mobility by developing a car as a service and believes the tech giant could grab 00NUMBER00 billion in annual revenue 00NUMBER00. the broader shared mobility market could be worth 00NUMBER00 by that same year and didi is positioning itself well for this growing market though it hasnt reaped the financial benefits yet. the companys ride sharing revenue was 00NUMBER00 million in the first five months of 00NUMBER00 but had an estimated loss of 00NUMBER00 last year. for now didi will have to fend off ubers growing presence in china and its latest round of investments. ubers recent funding round puts the companys worth at about 00NUMBER00 billion compared to didis 00NUMBER00 billion. while valuations are hardly a complete picture of how well companies are doing ubers recent funds could help it compete much better with didi in china. uber may have recently received more funding recently but didis advantage in china comes from its already strong presence in the country. its services are already in hundreds of chinese cities and it enjoys integration with the popular chinese social media app wechat giving it instant access to hundreds of millions of chinese users. china is already the worlds largest automotive market and its becoming increasingly clear that didi chuxing is poised to benefit from that. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

cnbc. on  squawk on the street   on tuesday a day after the companys annual worldwide developers  conference began   cramer said wall streets analysis of apple is kind of oxymoronic. i think that one of the things that happens with apple is its universally considered to be boring and past its prime that when they issue things im looking and im saying boy i want that but its past its prime cramer said. at this years wwdc apple unveiled of the newest  iphone   operating system a rebooted apple  music   and new capabilities for the apple  tv. cramer said all the things released at wwdc had too many articles about them and after  reading   them he felt the market will not like them. the disconnect between all the great things that tim cook is up to versus how we are yawning is funny he sarcastically said. bernstein analyst a. m. toni sacconaghi explained his  takeaways   from wwdc. the analyst noted that most of the announcements from apple appeared to be playing a catch up versus competitive offerings or were attempts by the company to close the gap on shortcomings within existing offerings. sacconaghi said the level of software and services integration within and across apples hardware products improved notably. the analyst believes it will genuinely bring improvement in the user experience and strengthen platform loyalty or at least mitigate defection. 00NUMBER00 yawn inducing stocks with top grade marksapple is currently focusing on the seamless integration of its various services. the iphone maker used 00NUMBER00 touch control to enhance notifications. maps and imessage will provide materially incremental functionality and allow extensionsaccess to third party apps without the need to leave the app the analyst notes. apples integration aptly referred to continuity includes new  features   such as auto unlock which unlocks a mac when someone approaches it with an apple watch. it also  offers   the ability to sync desktop and documents across devices and cross platform cut and paste universal clipboard. wwdc 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 big developments from day 00NUMBER00 up siri imessage and maps to developers suggests the company views each of these services as strategic platforms going forward and indicates that it feels it can compete more effectively by adding extensions to developer offerings sacconaghi explains. on tuesday apple shares closed up 00NUMBER00 at 00NUMBER00 and this morning aapl stock is skirting at the 00NUMBER00 per share level. year to date the stock is down by over 00NUMBER00 while in the last year it is down by

evidenced by higher than expected orders for watch chips and components. but would a more aggressive apple watch launch really move the needle on the tech giants enormous bottom line even if the market responds as optimistically to the new product as apple hopesimage source the motley fool. apple has stepped up procurement of chips and components for the second generation apple watch which is expected to debut later in 00NUMBER00 according to sources from the supply chain writes digitimes. judging from the orders the sources estimated that about two million units of the new apple watch could be shipped monthly. apple watch sales of this magnitude would likely represent a notable improvement. respected apple analyst ming chi kuo estimated  in april that apple sold about 00NUMBER00 million apple watch units 00NUMBER00 and he noted unit sales are likely slowing down in 00NUMBER00. so orders for apple watch components substantial enough to support sales of about two million units a month does suggest apple may be planning for a meaningful uptick in sales. the sources also indicated to digitimes that component shipments are set to begin in the third quarter a timeframe that aligns with a possible launch at apples annual september iphone launch event. this possible launch timeframe isnt new to the ever active apple rumor mill the apple watch is widely expected to adopt the annual launch cycle of the companys flagship iphone. while rumors like these may be interesting and sometimes even spot on with reality its best practice for investors to ignore them. apple ceo tim cook has specifically warned against reading into apple supply chain rumors noting its unlikely to capture the full picture for a given product the companys sprawling global supply chain simply has too many moving parts. further numerous past apple supply chain rumors have turned out to be totally off base. its also worth noting that an uptick in apple watch sales at this point would hardly contribute to the companys bottom line anyway. indeed the difference even 00NUMBER00 million incremental apple watch units would have on apples bottom line would be small. iphone sales which are currently at levels well over 00NUMBER00 million units a year make the new apple devices sales less important to the trajectory of apples earnings. image source apple. apple watchs small impact on apples total business is just as evident with an examination of segment revenue. for instance apples revenue from its other products segment which includes revenue from apple watch apple tv beats products ipod and apple branded and third party accessories accounted for 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue in the companys most recent quarter. longer term of course its important that the general direction of apple watch sales is upward. as a new product segment for the company growth in apple watch sales would be accretive to apples business. still analysis of supply chain rumors wont help investors gain insight into whether or not apples wearables segment will transform into a meaningful portion of revenue. if supply chain rumors and unit sales estimates are of little  if any value to investors where should investors turn to glean insight into the potential for apple watch unfortunately theres no magic crystal ball or short cut metric investors will simply need to exercise patience and keep an eye on the overall trajectory of apple watch sales over the next few years. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a

those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. according to digitimes apple  nasdaq aapl has stepped up procurement of chips and components for the second generation apple watch. the publication cites sources from the supply chain. the report goes onto say that component orders for the second generation apple watch have been higher than expected. the orders claim digitimes sources could mean that apple is gearing up to ship approximately 00NUMBER00 million next generation apple watches per month. digitimes sources also claim that because sales of the first generation apple watch have been sluggish the robust orders for the next generation models are rather aggressive. what does this mean for the idevice maker lets take a closer look. perhaps the most obvious explanation that comes to mind is that the next generation apple watch might just be a really  good product. the first generation apple watch was quite limited in its functionality and performance and with all of the time that apple has had to refine its next generation version i have little doubt that the new version will be a lot  better. a much improved version could drive sales by people who like the idea of the apple watch but know from their past experiences with apple products that the second generation is usually a lot better than the first generation of a new product category. my personal expectation is that the new apple watch will see a substantial improvement in raw performance which should enable many a step function up in what users and developers can do with the device. as long as the category for smartwatches themselves grow over the next year i can see apple delivering year over year growth in apple watch sales. apple has managed to capture a substantial market share even though it was far from first to market with a smartwatch. this seems to suggest that at least in the near future apple should at least grow with the market in other words not lose market segment share. that said if smartwatch sales ultimately tank then apple will probably have to scale back its buildorder plans as it could suffer a year over year decline in the coming product cycle. at the end of the day apple watch is a nice new product category for the idevice maker. if the company can continue to grow it out in time then thats good more gross margin positive revenue is generally welcome. however i dont think itll ultimately turn out to be the next iphone or frankly even the next ipad in terms of revenue and profit contribution. my expectation is that apple will need a bunch of these relatively small product categories in aggregate i. e. apple watch apple tv future apple product categories in order to ultimately have a source of revenue that can offset weakness in other product categories. in other words apple is just so incredibly large and successful that it takes a lot  to positively move the needle. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

about 00NUMBER00 and therefore they are taking to the options market to place long term bets. in recent days increased interest has been seen in apples 00NUMBER00 strike call option expiring in january reports  cnbc. in the past few sessions about 00NUMBER00 of such contracts have been purchased representing positions on some 00NUMBER00 million worth of apple shares. though it is not possible to determine the full extent of the position a given investor has on a stock if apple shares rise above roughly 00NUMBER00 representing a 00NUMBER00 rally by early 00NUMBER00 the buyers of these options are bound to see profits. speaking on cnbcs  trading nation   dennis davitt of harvest volatility management said up 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 months sounds shocking until you realize that apple was trading at that level a year ago. so its definitely within striking distance to get to that point… what youre seeing right now is people who are underweight and unsure buying calls to get exposure. the expert explained that the calls are  trading   at roughly 00NUMBER00 and for this reason they have potentially become a much more efficient way to gain exposure to the stock. max wolff of manhattan venture partners said call options are for investors who wish to keep some of their powder dry but still have some exposure to the possibility that the company will be able to rally back to where it used to be. though wolff does not expect the stock to rocket ship back to 00NUMBER00 if there is a surprise announcement like increased dividends or a buyback it would take just one day to get options investors at least half the way back there. fb stock have we really reached peak facebookin a recent  research   note argus research shed light on apples transformation from a

notes. the system describes showing two versions of the same image on top of each other one in grey scale and the other in color as a way to get high contrast on an lcd screen. this could be an improvement over single lcd screens which have trouble with contrast due to light leakage. the patent even describes a way to get around unwanted side effects of the dual layer lcd display such as halos artifacts and more with the help of an algorithm that would handle the process. camera   a new rumor claims that apple has scrapped the dual camera system for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus

snasdaq aapl  latest iphone launch  was out of the norm in a more than one way. first it came mid cycle debuting between launches of its flagship iphones. second the phone apple introduced was priced lower than any new iphone has ever been priced. given its out of character launch investors were uncertain how the phone would fare in the market. but so far its looking like a success so much so that apples production of the new smaller iphone hasnt yet caught up with demand. iphone se. image source apple. u. s. customers ordering an iphone se on apples website will have to wait longer than they would if they ordered any other model appleinsider pointed out  on wednesday. the earliest a customer can get a new iphone se online from apple is june 00NUMBER00 or just under two weeks. comparatively a new iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 could be delivered as early as tomorrow. wait times for online orders of iphone se are similar in markets outside the u. s. according to appleinsider. given that the new iphone isnt a flagship device and its already been selling for about two and half months apples supply shortage is surprising. fortunately high demand not supply issues are the likely cause. while theres certainly a chance apple could be experiencing supply problems this is unlikely. apple ceo tim cook said during the companys late april second quarter earnings call via a seeking alpha transcript   that demand for the iphone se has been very strong. indeed he specifically noted that apple was supply constrained because there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought. cook noted during the call that the company is working hard to get the iphone se into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. apples supply constrained iphone se poses a problem as long as demand for the new phone exceeds supply apple is either delaying or possibly even missing out on potential incremental revenue opportunity. apple management even acknowledged the hit its taking from being unable to meet demand. anticipating strong demand for its iphone se could remain ahead of supply during the current quarter apple cfo luca maestri baked supply shortages into the companys guidance. the guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supplydemand balance for iphone se maestri explained. due to these factors our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies. but theres more downside to apples supply constrained iphone se than a missed revenue opportunity. the type of customers the iphone se is attracting represents an important segment for apple that could benefit it over the long haul new customers. image source the motley fool. the addition of the iphone se in the iphone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem cook said during the second quarter call. why does cook believe iphone se buyers will expand apples total reach priced more aggressively than both the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the new phone is attracting customers the iphone previously wouldnt have cook explained during the companys second quarter call. specifically the iphone se is attracting many first time iphone buyers and android switchers. given apples industry leading loyalty rates this segment is incredibly important to the company. the fact that apples supply is constrained therefore is both good and bad. its good because it signals that iphone se demand likely remains very robust. but its bad because apples inability to fully meet demand delays a key opportunity to lock in an important segment of new iphone buyers. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot

aapl    and that spells trouble for  apple stock. once the kind of highflying hyped up pr events apples wwdc has been all but a let down this week with none of the one more thing spark. furthermore analysts are beginning to question unit sales figures again this time for the apple watch. and now apple has been ordered to s top sales of its iphone 00NUMBER00 in beijing  because of design similarities between them and a chinese made phone. because of this rising tide of negativity there is a potential profit opportunity for short term aapl stock bears. but before we get to trading ideas let take a quick look at aapls sentiment and technical backdrops. starting with the brokerage community apple stock continues to see a significant wellspring of bullish support from analysts. according to data from thomsonfirst call 00NUMBER00 of the 00NUMBER00 following aapl rate the shares a buy or better with no sell ratings to be found. meanwhile the 00NUMBER00 month consensus price target rests 00NUMBER00. however jpmorgan recently cut its target to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 due to lowered expectations for apple watch demand. if more analysts follow suit i. e. the iphone 00NUMBER00 unit sales revisions of a few months ago apples stock price could take a hit across the board. on the options front speculative traders are also clinging to a bullish outlook for apple stock. specifically the julyaugust putcall open interest ratio for aapl rests at 00NUMBER00 with calls easily outnumbering puts among options set to expire within the next couple of months. 00NUMBER00 all american stocks to buy nowclick to enlarge   overall july 00NUMBER00 series options are pricing in a potential move of about 00NUMBER00 for apple stock. this places the upper bound 00NUMBER00 while the lower bound lies at 00NUMBER00. technically 00NUMBER00 been a serious roadblock for aapl recently while support lies at 00NUMBER00. a breach of either of these levels could see apple stock move considerably more than implieds are pricing in. in other words aapl options might be rather cheap at the moment. put spread   with the stock struggling to make any headway recently and a small but growing bearish contingent there is a fair amount of risk for aapl right now. additionally if more brokerage firms follow jpmorgans lead apple stock is sure to breach support near 00NUMBER00. traders looking to bet against aapl might want to consider a july 00NUMBER00 series 00NUMBER00 bear put spread. at last check this spread was offered at 00NUMBER00 cents or 00NUMBER00 per pair of contracts. breakeven lies at 00NUMBER00 while a maximum profit of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 per pair of contracts is possible if aapl stock closes at or below 00NUMBER00 when these options expire. call sell   if betting directly against apple stock makes you nervous a july 00NUMBER00 series 00NUMBER00 strike call sell position may fit the bill. such a trade is especially useful if you already own aapl stock as it allows you to offset some of your portfolio losses in the event of a selloff but also allows you exposure to any upside up until the stock trades at or above 00NUMBER00. at last check this option was bid at 00NUMBER00 cents or 00NUMBER00 per contract. a sold call allows you keep the premium as long as aapl stock closes below 00NUMBER00 at expiration. on the downside if apple stock rallies above 00NUMBER00 prior to expiration you could be forced to provide 00NUMBER00 shares at current market value for each call sold which could be quite costly if you do not have enough stock on hand to cover the call. as of this writing joseph hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. gdx is still a buy on the dipsthe 00NUMBER00 best dividend stocks across all

that the idevice maker had hoped it would be. the company experienced its first year over year decline in iphone shipments last quarter and its expecting yet another decline in the current quarter. the lackluster performance of the iphone 00NUMBER00 generation has led the analyst community and investors alike to look forward to the iphone 00NUMBER00. early on the expectation was that the iphone 00NUMBER00 would bring both substantial new features and a significant chassis redesign as is customary for new number iphones. however as time has passed various leaks suggest that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will mostly consist of internal upgrades. in other words an iphone 00NUMBER00. . . s. although the new phone may very well turn out to be just that i cant help but wonder if these leaks suggesting that the next iphone will be boring are a deliberate attempt at misdirection ahead of the launch of the product. with demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of phones already relatively tepid it would not be in apples best interests for potential customers to get wind of the new features and enhancements that will be coming to this years iphone. if potential customers expect that the next generation iphone is going to be a modest enhancement over the prior generation one then they are more likely to upgrade their old phones to the iphone 00NUMBER00 as soon as practicable. on the other hand if customers know something amazing is coming soon then they are more likely to hang on to their old phones in anticipation of the new product negatively impacting revenue in the near term. the majority of apples revenue profits and ultimately stock price ride on the iphone. as the smartphone market slows down and as lower end smartphones become increasingly capable apple needs to bring interesting features and innovations to its devices with each and every new product. furthermore unlike its rivals apple only does one flagship smartphone release a year. this means that if apple doesnt release a product that resonates with consumers see iphone 00NUMBER00 then the companys financials and stock price suffer for at least the remainder of that cycle. apple should understand that phoning it in with any iphone generation is a surefire way to cause customers to lengthen their iphone upgrade cycles or to buy devices from competitors. more than anything apple needs to invest aggressively in making sure iphone stays on the cutting edge. apple is expected to launch its next generation iphone in september of this year so itll only be three months before the world sees exactly what the company has been cooking up. although the next iphone may turn out to be boring as some suggest the lack of truly substantive leaks at this point might mean that apple has been successful in keeping the next generation iphone under wraps. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts

shares of apple inc. aapl  were around 00NUMBER00 friday morning after the regulator of intellectual property in beijing ordered the company to stop selling the 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the city citing that the phones designs are too similar to a chinese phone. the order actually was dated back in may and the company has been appealing the ruling. apple has said that all of its phones have been and are still on sale in the country during the appeal process though some mobile phone stores already have switched from the older model and now sell the newer iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus phones. though the impact of the order is yet to be seen it does lead to the larger picture of apples struggles in international markets. for instance in may china shut down apples ibooks and itunes movies services as regulators said that the company did not have the proper licenses. news of the order itself isnt likely what has investors worried it is more the uncertainty of whether or not the chinese regulators will cause issues when apple rolls out its next iphone. with china accounting for approximately 00NUMBER00 of the companys sales in its most recent quarter any setback to the rollout could cause apple to make a massive hit in revenue. bottom lineif theres one thing that investors hate and that causes worry it is uncertainty. the ban on selling their older models likely wont have that big of an effect on the company but the unpredictability of chinese regulators and the chinese market in general towards apple is a concern to the company and its investors especially with the companys reliance on the country for a substantial portion of their revenues. only time will tell if apple will face further challenges in one of their biggest markets.

predict iphone sales based on supply chain rumors. supply chain rumors arent always wrong but they are unreliable. due to the complexity of apples supply chain its dangerous to assume that any one data point is representative of apples underlying performance. perhaps unsurprisingly the analysts have ignored that advice. in the race to get a leg up on rivals analysts spend countless hours talking to iphone suppliers in the hope of getting hints about how apples flagship product is doing. analysts are always looking for data to help them predict iphone sales. image source the motley fool. iphone sales forecasts based on supply chain data are particularly error prone the further in the future analysts are trying to project. that means investors should take apple analysts recent predictions about iphone 00NUMBER00 sales with a big grain of salt. in the past few weeks a number of apple analysts have commented on apples prospects for getting iphone sales growing again this fall. most are relatively pessimistic based on supply chain data such as year over year declines in iphone component orders. however the evidence isnt clear cut. apple has multiple suppliers for many components. furthermore apples component orders depend on its own inventory and expected component failure rates in addition to its sales projections. indeed analysts at bank of montreal  countered earlier this month with evidence that apples supply chain orders have stabilized recently. this highlights one of the big risks of relying on supply chain data namely that analysts are only seeing a small part of the broader picture. analysts looking at different parts of the supply chain can draw conclusions that are diametrically opposed. even if analysts correctly predict how many iphones apple plans to build apple could be wrong about demand. since it has the flexibility to adjust production fairly quickly even its internal forecasts for demand a few quarters down the road can be an inaccurate indicator of future iphone sales. around this time last year apple was planning to build 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 million units of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus by the end of 00NUMBER00 to the wall street journal. by contrast it had ordered components for only 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models a year earlier. apple rapidly boosted iphone 00NUMBER00 production in 00NUMBER00 after demand outstripped supply. image source apple. as it turned out it underestimated iphone 00NUMBER00 demand in 00NUMBER00. however it was able to raise its production plans as the strength of demand became clear. by contrast it likely overestimated demand in 00NUMBER00 and subsequently cut its production plans near the end of the year. thus evidence that apples initial iphone 00NUMBER00 component orders may be flat or down slightly on a year over year basis is more or less meaningless. if demand is solid apple should be able to ramp up production this fall just as it did two years ago  and thus deliver significant year over year iphone sales growth during the fall quarter. the key takeaway here is that watching the supply chain is no substitute for trying to estimate demand. forecasting demand is extremely tricky too but the advantage is that demand not supply is the primary driver of iphone sales. there are some good signs here. for example there are still a lot of pre iphone 00NUMBER00 smartphones in use. each new model launch increases the chances that users will upgrade these older phones. apple may boost the base storage configuration to 00NUMBER00 for the iphone 00NUMBER00 providing users with 00NUMBER00 gb phones a reason to upgrade irrespective of whether the new iphone has innovative features. furthermore while many users are holding on to their iphones longer a good number still upgrade every other year. with apple having sold more than 00NUMBER00 million iphones between the mid september 00NUMBER00 launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the end of 00NUMBER00 will be more users reaching this two year upgrade window this fall than ever before. finally apples unique ecosystem is attracting new users as quickly as it ever has. the lower priced iphone se could help apple appeal to more price sensitive customers around the world supporting this trend. ultimately customers will decide just how much iphone sales grow this fall if at all. supply chain leaks cant provide any useful information about the only thing that really matters customer demand. a secret billion dollar stock

packs many of the key internals of the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus into essentially the same chassis as the nearly four year old iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone se is also quite modestly priced for an iphone with versions packing 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of storage selling for just 00NUMBER00 without contract and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models selling for 00NUMBER00. on the companys last earnings call shortly after the launch of the iphone se ceo tim cook said that demand has been very strong and exceeds supply at this point. the executive did say that the company was working to get the iphone se into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. although supply seems to have improved it doesnt look like apple has reached supplydemand balance for these products yet. i recently visited applecom to check expected shipping times for various iphone se models. for all sim free 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models apples site says that the devices will be available to ship in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 business days. the same thing goes for all sim free 00NUMBER00 gigabyte models. in fact its not just the sim free ones that appear to be in short supply. the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 business day shipping time applied to all storage configurations and colors for phones sold pre installed with sim cards for all of the listed carriers through apples website. nearly three months following the launch of the iphone se and lead times are still proving quite long though not as long 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 week lead times  previously seen. supply has improved but it would seem that demand continues to outpace supply. although it would seem that demand for the iphone se is quite good i cant help but believe that apple is being extremely cautious about the quantities that it builds and ships into its distribution channels. recall that demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus proved to be weaker than apple had hoped. as a result of this weak demand apple guided to a weak fiscal third quarter as it tries to significantly reduce its iphone channel inventory. in fact on the companys last call cfo luca maestri said that apples channel inventory reduction is good for over 00NUMBER00 worth of product. even for a company as large as apple thats significant. apple is likely being cautious on iphone se builds in order to avoid having to undertake similar channel inventory reduction efforts in the future related to this product. indeed with new flagship iphone models slated to arrive in just three months the excitement among customers is likely to shift away from the iphone se and toward the newer phones. at this point it would seem that the iphone se is a success in no small part due to its price point. as a result i expect that apple will want to iterate on it going forward. there are a lot of directions that apple can go with a future iphone se. in addition to the usual internal improvements i expect that the next generation model could have

multiple firms are slashing their iphone unit estimates as skepticism about the upcoming   iphone 00NUMBER00 ability to recapture growth grows. despite the increasing bearishness analysts generally still see  apple stock  as a  buy. in a report dated june 00NUMBER00 rbc analyst amit daryanani said he trimmed his price target for apple stock by 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share. he also maintained his  outperform   rating on the stock. aside from the iphone unit number debate a related area analysts are watching is the length of  smartphone   replacement cycles which have been elongating from 00NUMBER00. daryanani said he is now modeling 00NUMBER00 month replacement cycles up from the 00NUMBER00 months he was previously assuming for the average replacement cycle through the iphone 00NUMBER00. the rbc analyst also noted that the iphone se appears to be doing well which of course is a double edged sword. while it may boost unit numbers for apple it also means that the average selling price of the iphone declines. 00NUMBER00 growth stocks that just dont have it anymoredaryanani actually expects a higher mix of the iphone se to cut the average selling price by 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 which is quite a bit. he also built greater conservatism around the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle into his model. he thinks apple stock is still attractively valued however and he expects apples gross margins to recover in the next couple of quarters and boost the companys earnings per share. the analyst also added that he still believes the success of the iphone should be judged in two year rather than one year cycles. however he also acknowledged that the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle is expected to be different than past numbered non s cycles because apple is expected to save the next set of major upgrades for next years model. daryanani continues to refer to next years iphone model as the iphone 00NUMBER00 although many analysts are now referred to it as  the iphone 00NUMBER00. apple inc. aapl the bears are roaring at apple stockhe also pointed out that hes not factoring in the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 pro model which could also be released this year. weve been hearing rumors about a pro iphone model for a while. daryanani explained that while a pro version wouldnt necessarily mean apple will sell more iphones it would probably boost the average selling price. earlier jpmorgan analyst rod hall cut his target for apple stock further than daryanani cut his. jpmorgans target went 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share although he also still rates the iphone maker at  overweight. interestingly he increased his average selling price estimate for the iphone to 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00. daryanani on the other hand expects the asp to head 00NUMBER00. hall also included additional assumptions in his report this week. he reduced his apple watch estimates as well and he now estimates that the smartwatch will have only a 00NUMBER00 penetration rate of its addressable market by the end of 00NUMBER00 which is a significant reduction from his previous assumption of 00NUMBER00. his  apple watch   unit number plunges from 00NUMBER00 million in fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million previously. apple shares declined by as much as 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 during regular trading hours on friday possibly as a result of the patent ruling in china where the company was ordered to stop selling the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. appl is ahead just under 00NUMBER00 in monday morning trading. many

options watchlist  at stock options channel is apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the april 00NUMBER00 expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the april 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost   for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to climb 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to happen meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the

week apple  nasdaq aapl shares got rocked by news reports that iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales had been banned in beijing. a regional patent tribunal granted an injunction against sales of the year old iphone models after finding that apple had violated design patents from an obscure chinese smartphone maker called shenzhen baili. a patent tribunal wants to ban iphone 00NUMBER00 sales in beijing. image source apple. this incident highlights the regulatory risk faced by apple and other western companies by doing business in china. nevertheless this particular dispute isnt likely to have a significant impact on apples iphone sales or its overall financial results. the beijing intellectual property office decided in may to halt iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales in beijing. while the two iphone models dont look identical to shenzhen bailis 00NUMBER00 the regulator argued  somewhat bizarrely   that the two designs were similar enough to cause confusion. however apple immediately appealed this ruling. the beijing intellectual property court has agreed to hear the appeal according to china daily. while the appeal is pending apple and its distributors can continue to sell the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. apple is likely planning to phase out both of these models this fall. after it releases the next generation iphone the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus will move down to the mid tier positioning while the lower priced iphone se will remain at the bottom of the iphone lineup. thus by the time the beijing intellectual property court rules on apples appeal it could be a moot point. apple has frequently been on the other end of cases like this in the u. s. winning injunctions against rival products only after they were discontinued. a bigger risk for apple is that the beijing ruling could be copied by other municipalities in china or expanded nationally and extended to the newer iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models which look similar to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. alternatively the recent decision could encourage other apple rivals to become more aggressive in asserting patent claims against the iphone maker. that said lower court ip rulings against foreign companies have frequently been overturned by higher courts in china. the chance that a sales injunction would be enforced in beijing  let alone more broadly is fairly minimal. furthermore after the iphone 00NUMBER00 is released this fall even the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus wont be high volume sellers in china. for comparison counterpoint research estimates that the current mid tier models the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus account for 00NUMBER00 of apples iphone sales in china. that translates to 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million units per quarter. in the unlikely event the mid tier models couldnt be sold in china apples lost sales would be a fraction of that amount. some customers would trade up to the iphone 00NUMBER00 series models. others might trade down to the iphone se. still others might buy mid tier iphones imported through the illicit gray market trade. the slow pace of the ip litigation process makes litigation risk relatively manageable for apple. if other companies jump on the bandwagon and try to assert patent claims against apple it will certainly drive up legal fees and could lead to some out of court settlements. the dollar figure amounts wouldnt break the bank for apple though. however the most pessimistic pundits see the recent beijing patent ruling and the forced shutdown of apples ibooks and itunes movies stores in china in april as part of a concerted effort by china to push apple out of the country. this may be an overreaction. a few years ago chinese state run media outlets skewered apple accusing it of treating chinese customers unfairly. these negative reports were similarly seen as the beginning of a campaign to push apple out in favor of homegrown smartphone makers. instead apple ceo tim cook issued a sincere apology revised some of apples policies and the 00NUMBER00 incident quickly blew over. similar attacks by chinese state media outlets in mid 00NUMBER00 stop iphone sales in china from soaring to new heights in late 00NUMBER00 and early 00NUMBER00. apple investors need to recognize that the company will probably continue to face periodic setbacks in china. however apple has achieved enormous success in china despite previous setbacks. in all likelihood it will continue to overcome these periodic regulatory issues and attacks by state media thereby profiting from the growth of chinas smartphone market. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

fan of republican presidential hopeful donald trump but he has not altogether cut ties with the gop. he has simply reeled in the companys usual support of the partys convention this year where the party will presumably name trump as the official republican candidate. as a sign of cooks aim to maintain good relations with the gop hes hosting a fundraiser for house speaker paul ryan. the june 00NUMBER00 breakfast will not only provide financial support for ryan but also other republican representatives. just for the record its not as if apple hasnt also supported democrats in the past and wont again in the future. its noteworthy though that cook and apple have yet to serve up any meaningful support for either democratic presidential candidate or the party itself this year. a message to the party after neither bernie sanders nor hillary clinton chose to pick a side in february  when the fbi and apple were in an argument over smartphone 00NUMBER00 blue chip stocks to buy as brexit fears recedecould be. or maybe it has got more to do with the fact that cook still sees the modern democratic party as anti free enterprise. either way things are getting real interesting with the usually liberal ceo. in the grand scheme of things it cant come entirely as a surprise. trump and cook have squared off before albeit indirectly … over the internet. case in point in february when the fbi asked apple to unlock the digitally secure iphone of san bernardino shooter syed rizwan farook and aapl politely refused citing right to privacy concerns trump called for an outright boycott of the company. its hardly the only difference of opinion between trump and cook however. cook has taken issue with many of trumps comments  regarding women muslims and minority groups. these are the keys to apples decision to not support this years gop in fact. as admirable as the notion of standing up for your ideals may be make no mistake … the message cook is aiming to send is more about winning and keeping the right friends in the right places choosing the more popular side of political and social divides that ultimately win the company the most business possible. as  the washington post  s jonathan capeheart  explained it a little over a year ago… cook is an american which gives him the right to lecture lawmakers in indiana two stores and arkansas one store about their wrong headed and very dangerous policies. as an american business leader he has an outsized authority that commands the attention of elected officials at all levels of government. i applaud his willingness to use his voice and stature to affect change here at home. in a perfect world cook and sorenson and mcmillon would be as publicly vocal abroad as they have been at home. yet you would be a fool to expect them to shake their fists with equal vigor in less tolerant countries unless your goal is to get them fired. the almighty dollar reigns supreme in the publicly traded companies they run. their first responsibility is to shareholders who want growth in markets dividends and profits. their american outspokenness could result in much more than eyerolls if exercised in another country. in that vein paul ryan may be a republican but the young politician is mostly a safe clean middle ground affiliate that largely avoids damaging controversy and therefore doesnt inspire ideas like boycotts or legislation that targets certain companies. its work that cooks predecessor steve jobs rarely cared to fool with. then again before tim cook became ceo many of the privacy and minority rights that have divided the country werent making headlines. to that end it should be made clear that the fundraiser being hosted by tim cook is tim cooks personal decision and not necessarily a message being delivered by apple itself. apple remains largely politically agnostic without a dedicated team to handle such matters. then again when the company and ceo in question are as high profile as apple and tim cook respectively theres no distinct line between the two. as for the impact all of this may have on the near term or long term value of aapl stock the reality is it probably wont matter much either way. yes apple has found itself in the middle of more than one political and social debate here and abroad. its ceos stances on domestic gay rights and privacy rights for instance have both drawn boycott efforts. apple inc. this 00NUMBER00 billion acquisition would set aapl stock freeboth ultimately failed though because in the end most consumers realize its just a phone or a tablet or a means of audiovideo entertainment. most consumers are pragmatic enough to realize a boycott effort would also do little besides annoy the boycotter. in other words the decision to support paul ryan but not support donald trump in 00NUMBER00 will mostly be forgotten and irrelevant a year from now. and thats probably the way it should be. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. 00NUMBER00 stocks you should buy at a 00NUMBER00 all american stocks to buy nowthe post apple inc. dont let politics sway your decision to buy or sell aapl

for working on a new type of display technology called microleds. at the time of the acquisition it wasnt clear when the idevice maker would start selling devices with microled displays. according to a pre publication note in digitimes apple is actively working to develop microled based panels that could be used in a next generation apple watch. according to the note apples micro led panels aimed at the apple watch wont arrive in the new models expected to arrive this fall. instead digitimes says apple watch models with microled displays could arrive at the earliest in the second half of 00NUMBER00. this information digitimes claims comes from taiwan based supply chain makers. candice brown elliott a display expert told displaydaily that microleds were disruptive. they are said to be multiple times brighter  than either oled displays or lcds which should help with visibility in very bright outdoor conditions possibly creating an interesting selling point for a future apple watch. for apples iphone product lineup the pattern has been for the company to introduce radically upgraded displays with new number releases opting to recycle the same panels during s releases a practice im not a fan of particularly as competitors move more aggressively. i wouldnt be surprised then to see apple reuse the same panel found on the first generation apple watch in the second generation model before making a big leap to a microled panel in the third generation apple watch. its clear that apple is investing very significantly in the apple watch product line particularly as we now know that the luxvue buy was almost certainly done to support apple watch development efforts. it doesnt seem likely this technology will come to larger screen devices such as the iphone or the ipad anytime soon if ever. only time will tell if the smartwatch market grows to be anywhere close to as large as the smartphone or even tablet markets. however apples actions suggest the company really believes in the future of this product category. at the end of the day its going to become increasingly important for apple to differentiate all of its various product lines with useful technologies that are difficult for competitors to match. if the smartwatch market winds up succeeding long term there will be plenty of copycats looking to take a bite out of apples business. these competitors more often than not try to compete on price. it will be of the utmost importance then for apple to build significant sustainable technological edges over the competition. as long as customers see value in what apple is offering it will be easier for the company to maintain relatively robust average selling prices and ultimately margins. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

resistance the report predicts. further the journal  s source asserts the new phone will come in the same sizes as its current flagship iphone duo the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00. these phones 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch display sizes were introduced in 00NUMBER00 with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. other rumored features to come to the iphone 00NUMBER00 lineup include a dual lens camera for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus a possible smart connector the connection on the sides of ipad pros that connects apples smart keyboard cover and an upgraded processor. looking into 00NUMBER00 apple reportedly plans bigger design changes for the 00NUMBER00 anniversary iphone. these changes could include an edge to edge organic light emitting diode or oled screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display according to the journal  s source. such modifications particularly an edge to edge display and the elimination of the home button to the phones design would truly represent a significant overhaul. it would make sense for apple to give iphone a significant redesign in the near future. its importance to apples business couldnt easily be overstated. not only does iphone account 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue and an even larger portion of operating profits but both iphone revenue and unit sales are declining on a year over year basis. in the companys most recent quarter iphone revenue was down 00NUMBER00 and unit sales were 00NUMBER00 respectively. similarly apple is expecting a double digit decline in total revenue for the current quarter because of continued expectations for tough year over year iphone comparisons. apples recent iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 upgrade cycles highlight consumers tendency to favor buying a new iphone when there is a more significant physical upgrade to the phone. the change from the iphone 00NUMBER00 flat sides and its four inch display to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus thinner design curved edges and 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch display sizes spurred a monster upgrade cycle. for instance iphone sales in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 or the first full quarter of iphone 00NUMBER00 availability were up a whopping 00NUMBER00 and year over year growth remained above 00NUMBER00 during each of the four quarters of the iphone 00NUMBER00 flagship year. conversely apples iphone sales are in decline during the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. with the same look as the iphone 00NUMBER00 it could be said the changes to the device simply werent compelling enough for some consumers. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. its worth emphasizing however that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus hasnt been a failure by any means its still handily outselling the iphone 00NUMBER00 from two years before. the huge iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus upgrade cycle simply makes year over year comparisons for apples newest iphone very difficult. still these two recent iphone launches do make a good argument for consumers favoring upgrade purchases interest when the iphone gets a meaningful physical overhaul. with these two recent iphone upgrade cycles in mind its possible apples iphone business could struggle to report any meaningful growth following the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch if it really does only feature minor physical changes. but even if these rumors are true such a significant overhaul to 00NUMBER00 could easily make up for any missed or delayed purchases when the iphone 00NUMBER00 is launched. going further there are other catalysts for iphone at work that have nothing to do with the phones physical design including apples impressive growth in its iphone installed base  over the past two years the highest rates of android switchers ever and apples strength at attracting new customers   that could help boost sales during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall

excellent if not innovative displays. the panels found on the companys imacs are sharp generally well calibrated and all in all help to deliver a pleasant computing experience. the majority of the macs that apple sells today include integrated displays but there are some mac systems such as the mac mini and the mac pro that require separate external displays. additionally some users of portable macs often want to be able to use their systems like desktops so they often connect their macbooks to external displays. apple has traditionally offered a display under its own branding known as the thunderbolt display for users looking for an official apple branded stand alone monitor. according to imore the thunderbolt display is no more. the problem with the thunderbolt display is that the current and apparently last model is quite expensive at 00NUMBER00. expensive isnt a problem if the product delivers value to the consumer but the issue is that the display simply isnt that compelling. its a 00NUMBER00 by 00NUMBER00 ips panel that covers the standard srgb color gamut. it also sports a built in facetime hd camera. not a bad display by any means but this display has been far surpassed by the retina 00NUMBER00 displays that the company integrates into its current generation 00NUMBER00 inch imacs. to put it into perspective a base 00NUMBER00 inch imac with a 00NUMBER00 core processor 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of memory a 00NUMBER00 terabyte hard drive discrete graphics card and  a wide gamut retina 00NUMBER00 display sells for 00NUMBER00. the imac mentioned above is more powerful than the fastest mac mini that apple sells a 00NUMBER00 product and it just so happens to come with a much superior display. one might as well just buy the imac. for those customers looking for a monitor to pair with the mac pro apples highest end professional oriented system there are simply many better third party options. some of these offer comparable quality to the apple thunderbolt display for lower prices while others are superior for the same price. the vast majority of the macs that apple sells today come with built in displays. the mac mini and mac pro are niche products. in particular the mac mini is aimed at more cost conscious buyers so those systems are very likely to be paired with similarly cheap displays. the mac pro is targeted at professional content creators whose display needs may be well in excess of what the current thunderbolt display offers. the needs of these users are probably not identical either. so apple had a choice it could update the thunderbolt display and only wind up satisfying a small portion of what is already a very limited total addressable market. or it could not bother and let customers choose from the very broad set of capable displays in the marketplace for their needs. the latter option simply makes much more financial and ultimately business sense so it shouldnt come as a surprise that apple chose to discontinue the thunderbolt display. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

lately bleeding consumer electronics company declined by 00NUMBER00 for the week. thats certainly not too shabby in light of some of the brexit related carnage but it was actually the apple related news that made it a rough week for investors. another analyst lowered his price target on the stock and more reports suggest that investors will have to wait until next year for a bar raising update for the iconic iphone. canaccord analyst michael walkley lowered his price target from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 as surveys seem to suggest that folks are holding off on buying new iphones until they see what the cupertino company has cooking for the iphone 00NUMBER00 in a few months. walkley is the latest wall street pro to cool on apples ceiling. j. p. morgan lowered its price target from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 a week earlier and goldman sachs  went from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 earlier this month. all three analysts remain bullish on the stock and thats important. however they all seem to be reacting to the reality that apple is going to have a rough couple of quarters. wall streets estimates calls for sharp year over year declines in revenue and earnings for apples fiscal third and fourth quarters. it boils down to sluggish demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 in light of the blowout success of the iphone 00NUMBER00 a year earlier. it may also be hard for the iphone 00NUMBER00 to stand out. unconfirmed reports continue to suggest that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will offer the same form factor and just modest feature updates to last years uninspiring iphone 00NUMBER00. most of the media attention is concentrating on reports that apple will do away with the headphone jack on the updated device. the new earbuds would connect to apples proprietary lightning cable port a move that could make the device more water resistant. users would also be able to use bluetooth headphones. game changing upgrades will apparently have to wait next year. thats when bloggers now expect apples inevitable screen switch from lcd liquid crystal display to oled organic light emitting diode may have to wait until next year a pretty big deal since that will be the 00NUMBER00 year anniversary of the landscape redefining smartphone. oled would allow apple phones to be thinner and more flexible. it would also make the display more power efficient something that increases the all important battery life. between apples seeming push of major upgrades to a three year cycle and the shift by all of the major u. s. carriers to end the subsidization of smartphone purchases   the appetite for consumers to upgrade every other year is waning. that doesnt mean apple is in trouble. it has more 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet and it has a track record of innovating just when the market thinks its out of tricks. the boo birds however are certainly out there. there 00NUMBER00 million shares of apple sold short by the end of last month the stocks highest short interest since late last year. the number of bearish bets would shrink by mid june but theyre still at a high level. apple stock  has lower sales earnings and price targets to hit these days but it cant afford to miss. the stock had its first down calendar year since 00NUMBER00 last year and its already in the hole through the first half of 00NUMBER00. the markets cooling on apple but you might not given the cheap earnings based valuation and the prospects for a turnaround to materialize in fiscal 00NUMBER00. this isnt apple at its best but its hard to bet against seeing the tech bellwether bounce back. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss

in apple inc. aapl    your first step could put you well ahead. but if youre looking to improve your margin of safety look no further than the aapl stock chart and a bull put spread. a recent regulatory filing  by warren buffetts berkshire hathaway revealed the funds recent and nearly 00NUMBER00 billion initiation position in aapl stock cost an average of 00NUMBER00. the aapl stock purchase may not look too shabby over the long haul but at the moment shares could be entering levels sufficient to entice the company to begin accumulating a second tranche at even stronger value. currently weak acting price action in  apple stock  over the last several sessions compounded by fridays surprise brexit announcement puts shares at a one month closing low 00NUMBER00 and more than 00NUMBER00 below the legendary investors margin of safety price tag. the top 00NUMBER00 sp 00NUMBER00 dividend stocks to buy nowthe margin of safety or the relationship between a stocks market value and its intrinsic value is sacrosanct with value investors when making a purchase decision like with aapl stock. but if you want an even better margin of safety than berkshire hathaway it may pay to look at the aapl stock chart in conjunction with a limited risk out of the money bull put spread. reviewing the weekly aapl stock chart and unlike mid may when apple shares were rescued from a very vocal and well publicized breakdown courtesy of berkshire hathaways stake hitting newswires shares appear to be headed lower. 00NUMBER00 week simple moving average support being tested right now or the failed triple bottom could act as support for aapl stock. we just dont think its going to be that easy for bulls. our view is shares of aapl have a stronger margin of safety for investors if shares tested the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 price zone. technically the area has two longer term fibonacci supports from 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 as well as a long term channel line to provide a more meaningful low playing out in the coming weeks. at the same time in appreciating that other value investors are already willing to begin their aapl stock campaigns and a chart which may or may not play out according to our own forecast an out of the money bull put spread is an obvious choice to begin an investment operation. looking at the aapl options board and given the discussed view the weekly july 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 bull put spread is worth considering. priced for 00NUMBER00 cents mid market the seller of this put spread is able to collect the full credit as long as aapl stock is 00NUMBER00 at expiration in two weeks. that amounts to a margin of safety or downside buffer of 00NUMBER00 from current levels. if aapl stock is above 00NUMBER00 at expiration the collected credit amounts to a return in excess of 00NUMBER00. and in the event shares put the vertical in the money the trader can begin accumulating stock for no worse than price of 00NUMBER00 and essentially on par with the recent may low. even better because this type aapl spread can only lose 00NUMBER00 on the current vertical market theoretically and sometimes in actual practice the trader is in position to begin buying aapl stock at markedly lower levels. ua stock under armour inc may be down but its not outfor instance if aapl stock was at 00NUMBER00 and at the lower end of our discussed support band at expiration the trader could use the existing paper loss as their initial long stock position and have an effective purchase price of 00NUMBER00. thats 00NUMBER00 below current levels. bottom line with income potential and the opportunity to purchase an out of favor apple stock with a margin of safety that includes stronger value and limited risk this bullish aapl put spread makes for a solid alternative to simply buying shares. investment accounts under christopher tylers management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives

quarter. representing 00NUMBER00 of sales its no wonder the figure is closely analyzed. apples iphone segment is without question the most important facet of apples results. so how many iphones can investors expect apple to deliver this quarteriphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. in its third fiscal quarter of last year apple  nasdaq aapl delivered 00NUMBER00 million iphones. ideally then it would be nice for apple to outperform this figure in the third quarter of this year. but its not looking like this will happen. indeed apple looks poised to report its second quarter in a row of declining iphone sales on a year over year basis a trajectory apple inventors arent used to. the best evidence investors have that apple will report yet another quarter of declining iphone sales is apples guidance which forecasts about a 00NUMBER00 year over year decline in total revenue. given that the iphone represents the bulk of apples sales apple management wouldnt guide for such a steep decline in total revenue if it expected year over year iphone sales growth. still it doesnt require a look at apples guidance to put a finger on the companys trajectory of declining iphone sales this year. unit sales were already down substantially in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. its clear therefore that apples iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle is facing some headwinds at least when compared to the year ago iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. data source apple sec filings. chart author. how many iphones could apple sell this quarter one simple way to make an estimate is to apply the companys expected decline in total revenue to apples iphone unit sales as iphone sales are after all a key driver of the direction of the companys total revenue. this would put iphone unit sales at about 00NUMBER00 million down from 00NUMBER00 million in the year ago quarter. expecting such a big decline should investors be concerned about apples business not necessarily. sure total revenue is declining in the near term. but investors shouldnt peg apple as a business in decline yet. some bigger picture context helps illustrate why apples iphone business is doing just fine. the monster iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle simply makes for a very tough comparison for the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. the iphone 00NUMBER00 or last years flagship phone was a blockbuster success. in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 iphone unit sales soared a whopping 00NUMBER00 and this was up from a quarter of record iphone sales. as apples first foray into smartphones with displays larger than four inches customers continued to buy iphones in record numbers throughout the year as they eagerly snapped up flagship iphones with new form factors. iphone sales were up 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 year over year in apples 00NUMBER00 fiscal 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. with this huge growth in iphone unit sales in apples recent history its easy to see why the company is struggling to post strong growth this year. so apples iphone business is far from struggling. unit sales are still significantly higher than they were two to three years ago for instance apple sold just 00NUMBER00 million iphone units in the third quarter of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 million units in the same quarter of 00NUMBER00. further apple is still commanding a premium price for its smartphones as it basks in unparalleled customer loyalty suggesting the tech giants overall customer base is sticking around. the iphone 00NUMBER00 therefore is a success but it has simply been overshadowed by the success of the iphone 00NUMBER00 year. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a

tech giants powerful competitive advantage is on display a complete end to end ecosystem including hardware software services and a massive user base. thanks to this comprehensive ecosystem apple music has some key advantages over spotify and spotify probably wont be able to do anything about it. spotify. image source spotify. earlier this week spotify attacked apple with some strong words. we cannot stand by as apple uses the app store approval process as a weapon to harm competitors said spotify general counsel horacio gutierrez in a letter to apple on june 00NUMBER00 via recode. spotifys frustration with apple is sourced from the larger tech companys decision to block a new version of spotifys ios app which apple deemed was attempting to circumvent apples billing systems instead directing new customers outside the app to sign up for the paid version of the service. if this really is what spotify is trying to do the move would allow spotify to acquire new subscribers through ios without having to pay a 00NUMBER00 to apple. app store on iphone. image source apple. this latest episode raises serious concerns under both u. s. and eu competition law gutierrez asserted. apple shot back with a letter of its own saying spotify is asking for preferential treatment. apple general counsel bruce sewell explains our guidelines apply equally to all app developers whether they are game developers e book sellers video streaming services or digital music distributors and regardless of whether or not they compete against apple. we did not alter our behavior or our rules when we introduced our own music streaming service or when spotify became a competitor. sewell also was sure to emphasize that the company has recently introduced a new revenue split for subscriptions designed to help all developers keep even more of their service revenue stream. he continued within a subscribers first year the traditional 00NUMBER00 split applies but after a year of paid service with a subscription an 00NUMBER00 share split kicks in. all current subscriptions are eligible if developers have subscribers they have already retained for over a year the 00NUMBER00 starts immediately. beyond this very public quarrel between spotify and apple theres an even more interesting storyline one that emphasizes the tremendous power of apples ecosystem. as the company that made iphone ios and the app store apple understandably has some control over the user experience and ultimately deserves a cut of revenue from customers acquired through its ios devices. further apple should obviously be able to promote its own apps on the device apps that of course wont have to give up the same cut since theyre available for download on own apples own app store or sometimes even pre installed on the iphone. iphone 00NUMBER00. images source apple. with over 00NUMBER00 billion active ios devices apples definitely has an advantage in some areas with its enormous and highly integrated ecosystem of hardware software and services. this ecosystem seamlessly ties together apples devices the app store and its services including its app subscription options for third party apps. but this isnt anticompetitive its the reward of building your own platform. whatever happens with spotifys issue with apple third party developers will have to continue giving a cut to apple for the customers acquired through apple devices. yes this means native apple apps such as apple music may be able to charge less than the competition since they wont be shelling out the same commission to an app store. but if third party developers built their own smartphone operating system and app store they would get the same advantage. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

have gyrated wildly since u. k. voters chose to leave the european union late last month. many analysts believe that brexit will cause a recession in the united kingdom and perhaps in the broader eu impacting sales of the iphone and other apple gadgets. the strengthening dollar will also contribute to lower revenue and profit for apples european operations. brexit is likely to reduce apples sales in the u. k. image source apple. nevertheless brexit isnt likely to hurt apple very much. any negative impact on demand in the u. k. and the rest of europe is likely to be offset by positive effects elsewhere. it is virtually inevitable that brexit will reduce apples sales and earnings in the u. k. first the current state of political turmoil has raised fears of a recession. this will naturally put a damper on consumer spending. indeed consumer confidence has already fallen to its lowest level in three years. to make matters worse the value of the u. s. dollar has risen significantly relative to the british pound. this exchange rate move means that american companies like apple will have to either raise their prices in the u. k. or accept lower revenue and profit on each sale there. us dollar to british pound exchange rate   data by ycharts. fortunately the united kingdom isnt a particularly large market for apple. the company only derived 00NUMBER00 of its revenue from the u. k. last year. by contrast the rest of europe contributes about 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue. brexit could potentially have spillover effects there due to the uncertainty about future political and economic relations between the u. k. and the rest of europe. however brexits impact on the european economy is likely to be smaller in scale. furthermore the euros value relative to the dollar has remained fairly stable thus far. curiously while brexit will hurt apples results in the u. k. and perhaps to some extent in the rest of europe it could actually bolster the companys sales and earnings in japan. thats because the brexit related flight to safety has caused the japanese yen to rise further against the dollar. us dollar to japanese yen exchange rate   data by ycharts. the yen has now appreciated by more than 00NUMBER00 against the dollar in the past year. apple already cut iphone prices in japan by about 00NUMBER00 in late april in response to the rising yen. the most recent strengthening of the yen has nearly fully offset this price cut. in other words apple is getting almost as much money in dollar terms for each iphone sale in japan as it was a few months ago when prices were 00NUMBER00 higher. thus apples customers in japan are benefiting from lower prices which should stimulate sales while apple hasnt had to compromise on its profit margin. japan is a much larger market for apple than the united kingdom representing 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of its global revenue in recent years. this means that modest sales gains in japan could go a long way toward offsetting a slump in the u. k. its important to note that apple does face some structural headwinds in japan. most notably smartphone subsidies are declining rapidly there as is also the case in the u. s. that could encourage iphone users to keep their old phones longer. but apples price cuts along with the growing popularity of trade in programs should keep iphones relatively affordable in japan. if europe as a whole falls into a deep recession then all bets are off. a stronger yen wouldnt provide enough of a sales bump to offset a big drop in apples sales in europe. but as long as the economic fallout from brexit is largely contained to the u. k. apple should be just fine. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a

these days. the same stock that rose every year since 00NUMBER00 finally proved mortal with a decline in 00NUMBER00. apple stock  is also trading lower so far in 00NUMBER00. i recently reviewed three former market darlings   that started the year above 00NUMBER00 only to fall to the double digits. apple was one of them. it has slipped 00NUMBER00 through the first half of the year but its a good trading day or two from reclaiming the triple digits. lets go over a few of the reasons apple has a shot to 00NUMBER00 later this year. apple doesnt have to fire on all cylinders to be a market darling. the ipod peaked in 00NUMBER00. the ipad topped out in 00NUMBER00. the iphone and mac experienced year over year double digit declines in units during apples latest quarter but its clearly too soon to write off either of those two product lines just yet. along the way we have apples push into smartwatches tv streaming devices and music services. this resulted in double digit increases in services and other products in apples otherwise lamentable fiscal second quarter. apple isnt done. its never been done. lets forget this tidal buyout chatter  thats starting to bubble up to the surface. even if apple overpays for jay zs fledgling streaming platform and thats just what would happen if the price tag approaches the 00NUMBER00 that piper jaffray analyst gene muenster believes it would take to seal the deal thats a drop in the bucket. apples balance sheet is flush 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and marketable securities. a good chunk of that is stashed overseas but theres still plenty of ammo to work with if apple should identify companies that can break it from its recent rut where revenues slipping and profits are falling even faster. other tech giants havent been afraid to strike with big purchases. apple has gone for bunt singles with its biggest deal being the 00NUMBER00 billion in beats electronics. if innovation doesnt save apple acquiring someone elses creations should do the trick. last month was a busy one when it came to analysts who lowered their profit targets. canaccord went from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. j. p. morgan went from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. goldman sachs  went from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. the good news for our purposes is that all three targets are still on the north side of 00NUMBER00. however a big reason wall street pros have cooled on apples near term upside is the growing consensus that the iphone 00NUMBER00 wont be much of an upgrade. apple is toiling in the shadows of 00NUMBER00 bar raising iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the markets faith that this falls 00NUMBER00 can build on that is teetering. thats fine. we may not get battery enhancing oled screens and the leading wireless carriers are no longer subsidizing smartphone purchases but lets not assume we know every reason someone may or may not want to upgrade to apples next smartphone later this year. apples down but it has earned the right not be called out. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

outdated blackberry  nasdaq bbry phones long after the vast majority of people have moved on from them. its as if our highest elected officials were forced to wear crocs while saying talk to the hand long after any self respecting person would have done either. even as blackberry fell to about 00NUMBER00 market share  in 00NUMBER00 of this year 00NUMBER00 the company maintained its government contracts. this put politicians like hillary clinton and president barack obama along with the united states senate  in a position where while regular citizens could embrace the latest apple  nasdaq aapl iphone or samsung  nasdaqoth ssnlf galaxy device our top leaders had to carry around 00NUMBER00 must have phone. finally however that has changed and the u. s. senate has sent a memo to the staff of its members which opens the door for apple and samsung. the changes being implemented in the senate phone policy will move u. s. senators from being the guys and gals still doing austin powers impressions or talking like borat to something a little more modern perhaps quoting kevin hart jokes. its a big long overdue move that ends an era. blackberry which peaked with just over 00NUMBER00 global market share in 00NUMBER00 had held onto government contracts due to its well earned reputation for security. that continued in recent years even as the company lost its stranglehold on business users and largely transitioned away from phones into software. in the policy memo   which politico published in its entirety the mobile communications services office said that it had been informed that blackberry has discontinued all os 00NUMBER00 devices 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and classic. the company later denied that it has discontinued the os 00NUMBER00 phone in a statement to crackberry   but that does not change that senators can now use certain apple and samsung models. the memo from mobile communications services noted that blackberry is committed to maintaining their support of our devices to include uninterrupted warranty and technical support. it also noted that it had limited stock of the blackberry devices and pointed out that offices wishing to make the transition from blackberry devices to other platforms could switch to 00NUMBER00 models or iphones with the new iphone se being mentioned. nothing was specified in the memo as to whether the newer samsung 00NUMBER00 phones are supported or if higher end iphones could be used. while nostalgia or a desire to recapture past glory has kept the company in the phone business blackberry has been working for years to transition away from that market. ceo john chen has openly talked about being willing to exit the phone market and he seemed frustrated at the companys continued identification with a product line which is no longer its core offering reuters reported. despite my best efforts to tell the world im a lot more than just a phone company every question i ever get is about phones chen said in late june. he did note that he expected to meet a self imposed september deadline to make the companys handset division profitable. blackberry made slightly more software and licensing 00NUMBER00 million in its 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 may 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 than it did device revenue 00NUMBER00 million. the company now offers a phone running android and chen has said he is willing to license its handset technology rather than manufacturing it on its own. the loss of u. s. government exclusivity however marks the final domino falling in what was once an impressive empire. its hard to remember but before iphone became something people lined up for in advance of a new models release having a blackberry was a status symbol. long after it lost that status it kept its reputation for security which made it the official phone of the u. s. government though it was never actually called that. now while blackberry handsets may exist in some fashion another nail has been placed in the coffin of the companys proprietary operating system. it was a good run one that maybe should have gone on longer but the blackberry as an elite phone is now no more with its last bastion of exclusivity finally falling. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

that sales of the iphone are slowing down but now citigroup    is raising other fundamental questions about the viability of  apple inc. nasdaq  aapl    as an investment. among the chief concerns of the citi analysts is the fallout from the brexit vote   which created a cloud of uncertainty in the stock market. because of the u. k. s decision citigroups analysts project a steeper than expected decrease in apple earnings. the 00NUMBER00 best dividend stocks to buy nowciti revised its third quarter apple earnings estimates 00NUMBER00 billion from 00NUMBER00 billion and lowered per share earnings 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00. for comparison the consensus is for apple to report 00NUMBER00 in sales and 00NUMBER00 in eps. the implications of the u. k. leaving the european union are beginning to crystallize. the steep drop in the british pound weakens the buying power of its citizens and apple relies on the eu for 00NUMBER00 of its income and on the u. k. for 00NUMBER00 to factset. and its not just the brexit weighing on aapl as the analysts understand more people are holding onto their devices for longerfrom the notewe are lowering our estimates for june and september quarters given potential for lower demand from macro uncertainty brexit related currency volatility and lengthening replacement cycles average replacement rate has gone from around 00NUMBER00 months in calendar year 00NUMBER00 to about 00NUMBER00 months recently and our model implies replacement rates could extend to 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 months. dont go out and sell off your stock in aapl just yet though. the rest of the analyst community while no longer fawning over apple in the news as much is still bullish. thirty nine of the 00NUMBER00 covering  apple stock  rate it a buy or better. and at 00NUMBER00 theres still plenty of upside to the consensus price target of 00NUMBER00. and even after lowering its estimates citi retained its buy rating on aapl stock noting that apples

china in particular. but apple is actually losing market share in this important market according to counterpoint research via bloomberg. does that mean the iphone se is underperforming managements expectations for the deviceiphone se. image source apple. of smartphones sold in the china market in may 00NUMBER00 of them were iphones according to counterpoint research. that figure is down from apples 00NUMBER00 share of smartphone shipments in the same period last year and it drops the iphone to fifth place among the top brands of smartphones in the country. highlighting the importance of price in the market all the smartphone manufacturers in china ranking above apple are local companies marketing mostly low cost devices. this is particularly interesting news following apples march introduction of the iphone se which had a starting price 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 less than the starting price of apples flagship iphones. but investors should keep in mind that apples lower market share this year compared with last year doesnt mean the iphone se failed at generating higher demand for iphones in china. as it turns out despite the lower market share for iphone in china in may theres good reason to believe the iphone se could be a hit in china just as investors hoped it would be iphone se deliveries were supply constrained during most of 00NUMBER00 with iphone se buyers even as late as june having to wait several weeks before their phones were shipped. the iphone ses supply constrained sales throughout the quarter highlights two important things first it suggests that demand for the device probably exceeded managements expectations for the quarter. second it paints counterpoints market share data in a different light the market share loss represented a small year over year decline considering apples newest iphone was supply constrained during the quarter. whether or not the iphone se pans out to be a success in china apple will likely need more tactics than a beefed up iphone inside the body of a three year old form factor to reinvigorate the once booming china catalyst. apples overall revenue in apples greater china geographic segment which includes mainland china taiwan and hong kong is facing headwinds recently falling 00NUMBER00 in the companys most recent quarter compared with the year ago quarter. image source the motley fool. but its worth noting that apples declining revenue in greater china isnt entirely representative of how apple products are really faring in the market. apple ceo tim cook broke down more specific numbers on mainland china which highlighted a more optimistic view of apples performance in the market during the companys most recent earnings call via a reuters transcript  if you look at mainland china which is the market within apples greater china segment that i am personally very focused on we are down 00NUMBER00 in mainland china on a reported basis. on a constant currency basis we are only down 00NUMBER00 and the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell through and if you look at there we were 00NUMBER00. keep in mind that is down 00NUMBER00 on a comparison a year ago that was up 00NUMBER00. cooks last statement is worth further emphasis. apples year over year revenue growth in mainland china in the same period last year was 00NUMBER00. the tough comparison therefore understates how well the tech giant is doing in china. notably apples second quarter revenue in mainland china was still up significantly  from where it was in the same quarter two years ago. however apples inability to continue increasing sales in china does suggest growth in the market wont come as easy in the future as it has in the past. even cook said during the companys second quarter earnings call that apple may not have the wind at our backs that we once did in china. overall while falling iphone market share in china as a well as apples recent year over year decline in greater china revenue in 00NUMBER00 may make apples china market situation look worse than it is its still a concern worth keeping an eye on. if sales in apples second largest market continue to decline over the longer term even apples price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 may begin to look expensive. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company

decision to exit the european union aka brexit. however the ripple effects from this historic decision will almost certainly reverberate throughout the global economy  in the coming quarters. case in point one wall street analyst recently penned a note to investors arguing that brexit will weigh on tech giant apple  snasdaq aapl coming quarterly report. lets quickly see how brexit may affect apples earnings and how it relates to the broader investing context for the worlds largest tech company. in a recent research report citi  analyst jim suva made the case for brexits negative influence in apples forthcoming july 00NUMBER00 report. though rather vague suva believes the general macroeconomic uncertainty from the brexit vote could lead to individuals purchasing fewer apple devices. more specifically he cited a lengthening of the iphone replacement cycle which would likely carry negative implications for apples financial performance in its current fiscal year. we are lowering our estimates for june and september quarters given potential for lower demand from macro uncertainty brexit related currency volatility and lengthening replacement cycles average replacement rate has gone from around 00NUMBER00 months in calendar year 00NUMBER00 to about 00NUMBER00 months recently and our model implies replacement rates could extend to 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 months the analyst and his team wrote according to fortune. however the analyst also noted that apple can still gain share especially in large markets such as india. given the largely superficial commentary on brexit suvas analysis seems more a reiteration of much of the conventional thinking surrounding  apple stock  today with a few brexit mentions interspersed to make things topical. image source apple. moreover since its effects are still unfolding fully assessing brexits likely economic consequences is more guesswork than legitimate analysis. many of the analyses conducted in the run up to the united kingdoms historic vote suggested brexit could cost the u. k. 00NUMBER00 gdp yet other estimates predicted 00NUMBER00 in economic output. said another way no one knows with any degree of certainty how brexit will impact the u. k. or global economies. consider this though in 00NUMBER00 only 00NUMBER00 of apples total sales came from europe. with the u. k. representing about 00NUMBER00 of the eus 00NUMBER00 gdp a rough back of the envelope calculation implies the u. k. represents a mere 00NUMBER00 of apples total sales. though this is a rough estimate the percentage being so low reiterates the overall point brexit seems unlikely to affect apples earnings at any level greater than a rounding error. however it does point to the negative story lines affecting apple. brexit aside things dont appear particularly positive for apples financial performance at least not in the near term. apple remains an almost exclusively product driven company. as such the company lives and dies by its ability to consistently churn out new hit products. unfortunately for apple this year the scuttlebutt from the companys east asian supply chain strongly suggests the forthcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 will offer only incremental improvements over its current smartphone lineup breaking apples long standing practice of meaningfully revamping the iphones form factor every two years. the silver lining in all of this is that apple is reportedly working on a sweeping overhaul of the iphone next year to coincide with the devices 00NUMBER00 anniversary. investors acutely understand the cyclicality inherent in apples iphone centric business model and they tend to bid up its shares  in the six months before apple refreshes the iphones form factor. assuming this trend holds with the 00NUMBER00 iphone investors should still have plenty of time to purchase shares ahead of this potential rally. whats more apple also enjoys some additional long term catalysts most notably its electric vehicle product project titan. theres also the outsized opportunities for additional capital return in the form of increasing dividends and ongoing share repurchases that should help support apples stock as well. to be sure it will be difficult for apple to replicate the companys historic run from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. at the same time though despite what might amount to an uninspired 00NUMBER00 apple still enjoys enough catalysts into the medium term to justify its continued placement in long term tech investors portfolios. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds

the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple  nasdaq aapl earnings have been scheduled. after market close on tuesday july 00NUMBER00 the tech giant will report its fiscal 00NUMBER00 quarter results as well as provide guidance for 00NUMBER00. ahead of apples results heres an early preview of what to expect. image source the motley fool. the most prominent storyline of the quarter will almost certainly be yet another quarter of declining revenue. on a year over year basis apple said in its second quarter results that it expected third quarter revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion representing a decline of about 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. similar to managements expectations for 00NUMBER00 apples second quarter revenue was down about 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter marking the beginning of a trend in year over year declines apple shareholders are hoping is temporary. while possible declining ipad and mac sales may play a role in driving 00NUMBER00 revenue lower the main segment negatively impacting apples top line will probably be the iphone. as apples largest product segment by far accounting for about 00NUMBER00 of revenue an expected year over year decline in iphone sales will likely be the main reason behind an overall year over year decline. this would continue a trend of falling iphone sales in 00NUMBER00. iphone unit sales fell from 00NUMBER00 million in the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million or about 00NUMBER00 in the second quarter of 00NUMBER00. apples declining iphone sales can be largely blamed on the iphone 00NUMBER00 failure to live up to the monster upgrade cycle last year spurred by apples first foray into smartphones with displays larger than 00NUMBER00 inches including the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 its 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. in the second and third quarters of apples fiscal 00NUMBER00 iphone sales soared 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. this growth makes for a tough comparison for apple in 00NUMBER00. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. there may be some hope that apple could alleviate some of this expected year over year decline in iphone sales. apple launched a new lower cost iphone  in the middle of its usual iphone launch cycle a phone that could particularly appeal to more price sensitive markets like china. but given that the phone was supply constrained   for most of the quarter its unlikely to have a big impact on apples sales. the consensus analyst estimate for apples third quarter revenue suggests analysts believe managements guidance is spot on. on average analysts expect apple to report third quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion right in the middle of the companys guidance range for the quarter. whats more worrisome than analysts expected year over year decline in revenue though is the consensus analyst for apples eps. on average analysts expect eps of 00NUMBER00 down a 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter. the outsized decline expected in apples eps metric is likely due to expectations for much of apples declining revenue to be driven by iphone as apples most profitable product segment the direction of iphone sales has a disproportional impact on business results. given the severity of the decline expected in eps this may be one of the most closely watched metrics when apple reports results. overall since a reported decline in apples business is almost certain investors will really be tuning into the tech giants third quarter results to see just how severe the decline was and to look for a glimpse of hope from management for revenue to turn upward in the upcoming quarters. apple will report its results after market close on tuesday and will host a live conference call to discuss the quarters results at 00NUMBER00 p. m. pdt on the same day. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

next iphone. raymond james analyst tavis mccourt is revising his top and bottom line forecasts for the new apple  nasdaq aapl quarter to the downside. he sees revenue of 00NUMBER00 for what will be apples fiscal fourth quarter below the market consensus of 00NUMBER00 billion. he also lowered his earnings projection from 00NUMBER00 a share to 00NUMBER00 a share. this is a pretty big deal because apple is widely expected to introduce its next smartphone before the quarters end. mccourts concerns make sense. the chatter in recent days has been about apple doubling the storage capacity of its entry level model. the shift from 00NUMBER00 gigs of internal storage 00NUMBER00 gigabytes will be welcome for consumers but it may not be so great for apple if it talks bargain hunters off of the mid priced model. it could also lead to more owners relying less on paying a premium for expanded icloud capacity. mccourt points out factors that will work in apples favor including lower commodity costs and kinder foreign exchange conditions but the rumored addition of a dual lens camera and the possibility of more effectively waterproofing the device by doing away with the headphone port could make the device more expensive to piece together. more importantly mccourt wonders why wall streets consensus forecasts suggest an improving gross margin when it has historically compressed during periods when a new iphone hits the market. he is sticking with his neutral market perform rating on the stock. hes just another analyst taking a cautious tone heading into a period that would historically boost apples stock and stature. remember when wall street would be waving rally flags as we approached a new iphone release now that apple is posting year over year declines in iphone sales and even the most bullish of analysts is expecting a decline from the 00NUMBER00 billion apple rang up in revenue during last years fiscal fourth quarter  the markets taking a more cautious approach. a common speculation is that the changes to the iphone 00NUMBER00 in a few months wont be enough to force a rush to upgrade. this has resulted in analysts lowering their price targets   on apple in recent months. the next upgrade frenzy may have to wait until next year and that isnt the end of the world if you happen to be long apple. mccourt may be trimming his outlook for the final quarter of apples fiscal year ending in september but hes feeling a bit better about the iphones chances come fiscal 00NUMBER00. hes now bumping his estimate for iphones sold from 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00. a major catalyst for the upward revision is that next years iphone model could launch earlier. apple has stuck to september for each of its past four generations but if the iphone 00NUMBER00 later this quarter proves to be a dud it could force apple to push next years model earlier into the summer. next years release could incorporate battery life enhancing oled screens and other bar raising features. it also cant hurt that apple watch will have another year of seasoning under its belt. mccourt is still concerned about how margins will play out in the new fiscal year that begins in less than three months even with the heavier volume of smartphones hitting the market. however the market will likely forgive a near term setback in profitability if it means that iphone unit volume is growing again. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

profitability as the iphone these declines have still hurt. in fiscal 00NUMBER00 ipad sales totaled 00NUMBER00 billion representing 00NUMBER00 apples total revenue. just two years later ipad sales had declined to 00NUMBER00 billion or 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue. ipad sales continued to decline at a double digit rate in the first two quarters of fiscal 00NUMBER00. ipad sales peaked in 00NUMBER00 and have been declining ever since. image source apple. however apple launched its new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro in late march near the beginning of its third fiscal quarter. this likely helped the ipad product line return to revenue growth at long last. it shouldnt have been too hard for apple to deliver ipad sales growth last quarter. in the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 sold fewer than 00NUMBER00 million ipads  the worst sales result since 00NUMBER00. apple sank to another low in the following quarter when ipad shipments dropped below 00NUMBER00 million. at the same time apple had the benefit of a product launch last quarter. the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro became the first new ipad to be launched in the spring since the third generation ipad came out in 00NUMBER00. this is why apple ceo tim cook felt confident enough to tell investors during apples april earnings call that the ipad would deliver its best year over year revenue result in more than two years during the third fiscal quarter. however cook still shied away from predicting that ipad sales would grow. indeed cfo luca maestri stated on the same earnings call that apple expected a sequential decline in ipad sales in line with normal seasonality. based on apples lackluster 00NUMBER00 ipad sales this would also imply a year over year decrease. nevertheless there is a good chance that the ipad finally snapped its streak of revenue declines last quarter. according to mobile marketing company fiksu the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro 00NUMBER00 of all ipad usage  by the end of last quarter. assuming that there are 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million ipads in active use this means that apple probably shipped at least 00NUMBER00 million units of the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro including some that went into channel inventory. apple may have shipped 00NUMBER00 million units of the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro last quarter. image source apple. the larger 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro and smaller 00NUMBER00 inch ipad mini 00NUMBER00 continued to sell at a slow but steady rate during 00NUMBER00. furthermore ipad air 00NUMBER00 usage rose significantly during the quarter suggesting solid sales of that older discounted model. estimating unit sales based on changes in usage is an inexact science. but based on the available data it seems likely that ipad unit sales fell in the 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million range approximately in line with or slightly below the year ago sales total. however even if ipad unit sales declined somewhat on a year over year basis ipad revenue probably rose. thats because apples new ipad pro devices are significantly more expensive than the average ipad sold in recent years. the smaller ipad pros starting price is 00NUMBER00 while the larger model tops out 00NUMBER00 for a 00NUMBER00 gb model with cellular capability. in 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00 the average selling price for an ipad was just 00NUMBER00. given that the two ipad pro models appear to have generated 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of total ipad unit shipments last quarter the average selling price asp was probably closer to 00NUMBER00. with a 00NUMBER00 asp apple would produce double digit year over year ipad revenue growth even if it only shipped 00NUMBER00 million ipads last quarter. demand for apples new ipads is clearly lackluster relative to a few years ago when new ipad releases would always spark a surge in sales. yet demand may have been sufficient to get ipad revenue if not unit sales growing again last quarter. this would be great news for apple especially if management views the return to growth as sustainable over the next several quarters. now that apple can no longer rely on steady iphone sales growth to lift its overall results its more important than ever for the company to get ipad sales growing again. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

00NUMBER00 million rides every day to its 00NUMBER00 users in 00NUMBER00 cities in the country. like all ride hailing services didi has had to deal with ensuring its passengers safety. one of its passengers was murdered by a didi driver in may and earlier this year the company removed 00NUMBER00 drivers from its service for not meeting the companys background checks. thats why didi recently increased its safety precautions adding a handful of new features. heres what the company is currently doing. one of the companys new safety features allows riders to tap an sos button inside the app if something goes wrong during a ride. the passengers phone will then automatically start recording audio which will be listened to by didis trained sos taskforce members according to the company. didi will be able to communicate with the passenger directly when sos is enabled. the app also sends out an alert to the riders preset emergency contacts when sos is activated. the company now allows riders to send their real time location destination estimated time of arrival and the vehicle license number to their contacts. these services are now available for all of the companys users across the 00NUMBER00 cities where didi chuxing operates. didi says its background checks are the most extensive in china. the company looks at both local and national agency databases when researching drivers and their vehicles. the checks are ongoing as well so if something new pops up on a drivers record the company should in theory find out about it. didi boasts that its background checks make it the only ride hailing platform in the industry to cooperate with relevant state departments in china which is a knock against uber the two companies are engaged in a turf war in the country but didi is winning. didis app now also keeps the phone numbers of both the passenger and the driver private so that neither one knows the others direct contact information. didi has also implemented voice and facial recognition features for drivers. they are required to log in using the biometric features to prove that they are the person who is supposed to be driving the vehicle and picking up passengers. didi chuxing already had safety measures in place for its service but the companys ongoing expansion  has put pressure on the company to make sure its doing everything it can for its passengers safety. didi just raised 00NUMBER00 billion from its latest round of funding including 00NUMBER00 billion   from apple. independent research shows that didi holds about 00NUMBER00 of the ride hailing market in china while uber says it holds one third both cant be right of course. uber just received more funding and will use some of it to expand further into china. the two will likely battle it out in chinas ride hailing market for the foreseeable future. as these companies expand and potentially more news about safety issues emerge its likely we havent heard the last of what didi uber and other ride hailing companies  are doing to ensure passenger safety. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall

the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the january 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls »the

device in the category earning five out of five of the j. d. powers power circle ratings. second place samsung  earned just two of five power circle ratings. the report highlights an important takeaway for apple investors while apple watch sales may be off to a slow start its at least a start that is satisfying customers. apple watch. image source apple. in the smartwatch satisfaction survey 00NUMBER00 factors were examined according to j. d. power. the factors included ease of use comfort battery life phone features price strengthdurability display size stylingappearance reliability apps available and customer service. apples overall score on a 00NUMBER00 point scale was 00NUMBER00. samsungs overall score was 00NUMBER00. but j. d. power circle ratings highlight a larger gap between the two companies apples five star rating stands for among the best and samsungs two star rating is pegged with a not so impressive description the rest. apple. . . ranks highest in customer satisfaction with smartwatches and performs particularly well in comfort stylingappearance and ease of use j. d. power said in a press release on tuesday. going forward apple watch customer satisfaction could get a boost. the new watchos update coming this fall enables apps to launch instantly by allowing apps to be installed natively on the watch and by having up to date information ready ahead of time. this change addresses what is arguably watchoss most frustrating problem today sometimes its faster for users to pull their iphone out and open an app than it is to open the corresponding apple watch app to view the same information. watchos 00NUMBER00. image source apple. of course the fact that customers are enjoying the apple watch isnt necessarily new information. management has been citing favorable customer satisfaction data for apple watch since shortly after its 00NUMBER00 debut. and the boasting continued into the companys most recent earnings call. our customers are very happy with apple watch said apple cfo luca maestri during the tech giants most recent earnings call. maestri followed by citing a recent 00NUMBER00 research study measuring apple watchs customer satisfaction rate at 00NUMBER00. its worth noting that samsung is capitalizing in one subsegment of the wearables market where apple isnt. samsung ranks highest in customer satisfaction in the connected fitness band category where apple doesnt have a product. samsungs overall satisfaction score in this segment is 00NUMBER00 and j. d. power boasts a five power circle rating. a high customer satisfaction score for the apple watch could signal more market opportunity for the new device. apple has always strived to put the customer experience above all else when designing products and it has proved to be an effective strategy for the company. the ipod iphone and ipad were all products ranking high in customer satisfaction studies. historically apples emphasis on the user experience has helped the company develop a dominating share of profits in new product categories and sustain these advantages for years. specifically apples outsize customer satisfaction in the nascent category so early can help apple increase customer loyalty and repurchases. but since the apple watch still represents a very small portion of the companys sales probably around two to three percent this news doesnt necessarily affect an investment thesis in the stock. but it does at least reaffirm that apple watch is here to stay and that it will likely be a key contender if the category takes off. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

00NUMBER00 decline. interestingly as the overall market outperformed expectations pc maker apple  nasdaq aapl actually saw its market segment share shrink year over year from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 the second quarter of the year. independent technology analyst kurt marko offered a succinct and in my view likely accurate view of why apple may have ceded share to other personal computer makerswhat happens when you dont update your pc lineup for a couple years apples pc sales fall behind asus  httpst. 00NUMBER00 apple has made some incremental improvements to its core macbook pro and macbook air product lines over the last two years markos comment is fundamentally on point apple hasnt released substantial updates to these products in a long time. the bad news is that this kind of neglect of a core market is not the sort of behavior that investors should expect from one of the worlds largest and most successful technologies companies its what one would expect from a company thats currently strapped for cash and cant afford to invest in newer better products. the good news though is that apple seems to be on the verge of a long awaited refresh of its macbook lines which could help to catalyze sales and ultimately recapture lost market share. analyst ming chi kuo with kgi securities via 00NUMBER00 said back in may that new macbook pros are coming in the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00. these new macbook pros arent expected to just be minor spec bumps of the current models but instead fundamental redesigns of the computers. kuo claims that the new machines will in typical apple fashion see reductions in weight as well as thickness. they will also reportedly come with touch id capability something my former foolish colleague evan niu mused about in an article   published back in january of last year an oled touch bar to replace the physical function keys on the keyboard and support for both usb type c and thunderbolt 00NUMBER00. additionally i expect that the new systems will come with new intel   processors. the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro should see a one generation improvement in processor performance while 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro should enjoy a two generation jump in processor performance. beyond those features its probably time for apple to adopt new display panels on the new macbook pro systems. apple has transitioned its imacs and the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro to displays that can display the dci 00NUMBER00 color space a wider space than the srgb color space that current macbook pro displays target. i fully expect to see wider color gamut displays on the next 00NUMBER00 inch 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro models. it seems reasonable to expect that newly refreshed macbooks will help apple regain share in the broader pc market. however what apple needs to do going forward is to not let its mac lineup get as stale as it did with its current macbook air and macbook pro line of systems. on apples most recent earnings call ceo tim cook said that the company is confident in apples mac business and in the companys ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. well see if this view is justified as the next couple of mac product cycles play out. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a

be bought or sold on a public exchange. common and preferred stocks corporate government and municipal bonds cash and other financial assets are thus examples of marketable securities. marketable securities can be short or long term assets. although a 00NUMBER00 year u. s. treasury bond must be held for 00NUMBER00 years for the investor to get his or her principal back it can be sold relatively quickly on the bond market. thus a government bond is considered a marketable security and often colloquially described as being cash even though the bond itself doesnt promise to return the principal back to the owner for years later. investors who dig through the annual reports of publicly traded companies will often find that large companies hold marketable securities on their balance sheets. apple   the california based manufacturer of iphones and mac computers has such a large pile of marketable securities that it employs its own captive fund  to manage all of the money it has made over time. well use it as an example. on page 00NUMBER00 of its 00NUMBER00 annual report apple reported that it held about 00NUMBER00 billion of marketable securities on its balance sheet. the chart below shows the breakdown by type of security. there are three very important observations to make about apples marketable securities. first apple keeps very little of its money in the form of cash blue on the chart. because marketable securities are easy to buy and sell and can thus be turned into cash quickly apple doesnt need to keep a lot of cash on hand. cash generates no return thus cash rich companies prefer to invest the money into marketable securities to generate additional profit. second marketable securities can vary tremendously in their risk and return profiles. cash certificates of deposit and u. s. government securities are extremely low risk low return investments. corporate securities stock or bonds and mutual funds that own stocks and bonds offer higher returns but carry higher risk profiles. despite these differences in risk and reward stock holdings of other companies high risk high reward are just as much of a marketable security as a u. s. treasury bill very low risk very low reward because both can be readily sold and turned into cash on an as needed basis. finally marketable securities for non financial companies are frequently referred to as cash despite the fact they are not cash at all. when investors speak about apples 00NUMBER00 billion cash pile theyre actually referring to its marketable securities which can be turned into cash at a moments notice. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

would argue too that mr. market is quite obtuse when it comes to the totality of apple. everything else that a rational investor would consider in accessing apple as an investment is literally put in

of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. over the last 00NUMBER00 years apple  nasdaq aapl has consistently increased its share of the pc market with its line of macs. in fact apple has gained market share in 00NUMBER00 of the last 00NUMBER00 quarters. that trend may be coming to an end however as idc estimates the global pc market didnt fall as much as originally expected last quarter just 00NUMBER00. the research firm expects apple to report an 00NUMBER00 decline in mac shipments when it provides its earnings results later this month. mac sales accounted for 00NUMBER00 of apples total sales through the first six months of fiscal 00NUMBER00. the product is of increasing importance in light of weakness in ipad sales and a hangover from strong iphone 00NUMBER00 sales. should investors worry about apples ability to grow its share of the pc marketin idcs report the research company provides an explanation for apples outsized decline in shipments apple continues to face an increasingly competitive market as it awaits a refresh of its pc lineup. apples macbook lineup is long overdue for a refresh. the company released the new macbook last spring but hasnt updated the macbook air macbook pro imac or mac pro lines in some time. they all still use older generations of intel  s chips and the portables need a design refresh to support new ports like thunderbolt 00NUMBER00 usb c and better displays on the air. apple is expected to unveil refreshes to its mac lineup in the fall when it usually releases new iphones and ipads. that means that apples mac sales could languish for another quarter before getting a bump from the new releases in the last three months 00NUMBER00. adding to that is the economic uncertainty hanging over europe after the brexit vote last month. that could cause a bigger decline in pc sales particularly the premium priced consumer facing macs apple produces. additionally apple is facing slowing growth in the chinese market that drove its sales last year. apples pc market share growth was fueled by the adoption of its other devices like the iphone and ipad. but apple is now starting to experience a decline in iphone sales and ipad sales have been declining for some time already. that trend would indicate that apples mac sales may have already peaked. even with slight growth in the u. s. pc market last quarter idc says apple failed to grow its mac sales in the country year over year. apple took just 00NUMBER00 of the market in the united states. by comparison its share of the smartphone market in the country is close to 00NUMBER00. that indicates that even apples well established user base of over 00NUMBER00 billion active devices isnt enough to spur sales of the mac. that might make investors question whether a product refresh is all thats needed to spur sales of the mac. however consider the factors behind the slowing sales of apples other devices it had a blockbuster product with the iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 sales are still outpacing iphone 00NUMBER00 sales and the product lifecycle is getting longer. while the latter factor may apply to pcs the market has largely adjusted to the introduction of smartphones and tablets. apples macbook release was popular boosting sales of macs for a few quarters though not to the degree that the iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone sales and on a much larger scale no less. theres no explanation for the decline in mac market share other than a lack of refresh. apple may have been too aggressive in its plans for a mac refresh. apple has historically held off on product ideas because it was missing some technology. this can be bad for short term results but ultimately benefits apple in the long term as it leapfrogs the competition. still apples hesitation to push a smaller update to macs with new processors and designs has caused it to fall well behind the competition and certainly seems like an error in judgment. nonetheless apple should be able to rectify the problem just by updating its product line as theres no other indication that apple is suffering a long term decline in its brand. a secret billion

questioned whether the tech giants heyday was behind it. apple stock  has declined more than 00NUMBER00 percent over the past year with shares trading below 00NUMBER00. while many have sold their shares amid worries that apples time at the top is over long term traders would be wise to snap up aapl stock before it makes its comeback in just a few short months. the major reason apple stock has declined has been poor iphone sales data. this year the companys iphone sales declined for the first time ever. this is a big problem as iphone sales make up more than half of the companys revenue but it is unlikely that this years trend is the beginning of the end. a decline in sales is never a good sign but its important to consider that apples 00NUMBER00 figures were exceedingly high so the decline was exacerbated by the year over year comparison. 00NUMBER00 stellar dow jones stocks to buy for 00NUMBER00 about the decline in iphone sales are overdone while sales dropped the number of customers who switched from an android phone to buy the iphone 00NUMBER00 actually increased. in terms of dollar signs this doesnt make much difference but in terms of future growth and expansion converting customers and gaining market share is a big deal. apple users tend to be fiercely loyal with 00NUMBER00 percent of them sticking with the company when they upgrade. if you dont believe that apples most recent iphone sales figures are a sign that the firm has fallen off a cliff then aapl stock is most certainly a buy right now. its unlikely to stay below 00NUMBER00 much longer and with a price to earnings ratio of only 00NUMBER00 now is one of the few times investors will be able to own such a sturdy company at a bargain price. apple has a long history of solid dividends and share repurchase programs and with very little debt and a boatload of cash investors can expect to see buybacks and dividend hikes in the years to come. its difficult to say with certainty when apple stock will make its comeback but many expect to see a surge ahead of the september release of iphone 00NUMBER00. in the past aapl has mostly outperformed in the weeks leading up to new product launches so its likely that the stock will see a bump in the coming months. there is some talk of the iphone 00NUMBER00 seeing muted demand as it isnt expected to offer any vast improvements over previous models. this could mean that investors will have to wait a bit longer to see any substantial gains but 00NUMBER00 marks the 00NUMBER00 year anniversary for the iphone and apple is expected to celebrate in a big way. apple is rumored to be working on making major improvements to its handset for the 00NUMBER00 release of iphone 00NUMBER00. analysts are speculating  that the new device could offer everything from a curved screen to wireless charging and the buzz surrounding the device is expected to be huge. apple stock has been punished in recent months but worries about the companys staying power are overblown. true apple may not be the growth engine it once was but the likelihood of iphone sales falling dramatically every quarter is low. not only will the stock see a lift ahead of the release of this years handset the firm is expected to make a major comeback in 00NUMBER00 with iphone 00NUMBER00. yum brands inc. yum stock looks finger licking good on china headwaywhile this may

casemakers ahead of launch so that they can get their own products ready. included in the dummy versions of the smartphone shown in the image are four different color options rose gold space grey gold and silver. missing is the rumored dark space grey option that some leaks have claimed will be added. battery   a new rumor claims that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will have a larger battery than the iphone 00NUMBER00 bgr notes. according to this rumor the iphone 00NUMBER00 will come 00NUMBER00 battery. this is an increase over 00NUMBER00 found in the iphone 00NUMBER00. a larger battery would hopefully mean that users can get more time out of the upcoming ios device. theres a possibility that apple could increase the battery size due to the rumored removal of the headphone jack. 00NUMBER00 has it that apple is bidding on formula one racing   reports appleinsider. this rumor claims that the tech company is currently placing bids to take over ownership of the racing series. this would be a large acquisition for aapl but it would include streaming rights for its tv service and give it access to many automobile manufacturers. this could help it with its own rumored car project which is currently being called project titan. the post thursday apple rumors leaks shows iphone 00NUMBER00 first on  investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the

apple  nasdaq aapl suppliers as the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch date approaches. usually apples high tide of iphone sales have helped lift its suppliers up along with it but the companys drop in iphone sales last quarter hurt invensense  nyse invn and other apple suppliers. invensenses revenue declined 00NUMBER00 year over year in part because of the iphone sales drop. pacific crest said in its investor note that the upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 concerns put estimates at risk for invensense and eight other suppliers. the research group was formerly bullish on iphone 00NUMBER00 demand but has since said that there will be much more disappointing iphone sales in late 00NUMBER00. invensenses stock lost 00NUMBER00 after the note was released its since gained that back. but its difficult to separate invensenses fate from the iphone because the component maker earned about 00NUMBER00 of its total revenue from apple in fiscal 00NUMBER00. most of the current projections for apples next device dont bode well for invensense either. invensense has relied on apples business for years. that used to be a huge blessing but has since turned into one of invensenses biggest curses. invensenses revenue dropped 00NUMBER00 over year the same quarter that iphone sales fell. the problem for invensense is that most analysts are predicting disappointing sales estimates for apples next device. ming chi kuo an analyst at kgi securities with a pretty reliable track record says that worst case scenario would 00NUMBER00 iphone shipments at about the same level as they were 00NUMBER00. kuo expects 00NUMBER00 million iphone units sold this year compared to 00NUMBER00 million units in 00NUMBER00. the best case scenario from kuo is that apple ships 00NUMBER00 million iphones which would still be an 00NUMBER00 drop year over year. there are some positive estimates for iphone shipments of course. bmo capital markets analyst tim long believes that theres pent up upgrade demand for iphone users. he says there are 00NUMBER00 million phones that are poised for an upgrade based on past data  on iphone upgrade cycles by users. long says that many iphone users upgrade their device every two years and that this year there are more of them than usual. when the iphone 00NUMBER00 launched 00NUMBER00 of existing iphone users had owned their device for two years or more that fell to 00NUMBER00 when the iphone 00NUMBER00 was launched but will be at 00NUMBER00 when the iphone 00NUMBER00 in the fall. long thinks this demand means there could be record sales for the iphone 00NUMBER00. if that happens then invensenses stock could  bounce back a bit but theres no guarantee. remember that invensenses stock began its decline in 00NUMBER00 while apples iphone sales were still strong. most of the news surrounding apples next iphone is that the company is removing the headphone jack. there are other reports that the company will finally increase the base amount of internal storage as well. we dont know anything for sure yet but if those are indeed the biggest selling points of apples next device then both companies are probably in for some rough times ahead. invensense knows all too well the problems with tying its revenue sources too much to smartphone sales. in addition to its problems stemming from apple the companys been burned by falling samsung  smartphones sales and has even lost some of samsungs business. invensense has tried to offset all of this with an ever increasing focus on selling components for internet of things iot devices. but that hasnt happened fast enough. 00NUMBER00 of the companys total revenue in 00NUMBER00 came from iot sales. for now it appears invensenses fate is still too closely aligned with the smartphone market and apple in particular. and as odd as it is to say it thats no longer a strong enough business model to bank on. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. chris neiger  has no position in any stocks mentioned. the motley fool owns shares of

shrewd acquisition  of tidal a recent investor note suggests that the company is losing ground in its continued challenge to streaming leader spotify. lets take a look. cowen co. reports that apple music loses customers three times as fast as spotify. a survey of 00NUMBER00 u. s. consumers revealed that apple music and spotify have churn rates  of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. image source spotify. since the on demand streaming industry is young it isnt yet clear what constitutes a normal churn rate. however using other well known subscription industries apple musics churn rate still seems alarmingly high. for example telecom leaders verizon communications   and att     saw churn rates of roughly 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. in my time covering these sectors i cant recall seeing any major subscription business with such a high churn rate. its a clear red flag especially as apple attempts to challenge spotify with an updated version of apple music. at the same time though the analysis isnt necessarily as black and white as it might at first appear. spotify and apple music differ in their customer acquisition strategy in subtle but important ways. spotifys freemium model  allows users to get acquainted with the service through its free ad supported tier before they become paid subscribers. apple music offers only three month trials to its subscription tier. viewed this way apple musics churn rate should  be higher than spotifys. spotify can court paying users from its large swath of free tier listeners. those willing to upgrade probably find the service so valuable that theyll remain loyal. image source apple. on the other hand apples free trial model requires users to unsubscribe before their three month preview window closes a model that engenders a relatively high churn rate. so it should come as no surprise that apple music has a higher churn rate than spotify though a three fold difference between the two still seems large. another important distinction between the two services is that apple can afford to run apple music at a perpetual loss while spotify must turn a profit especially with an ipo looming. as an investors business daily   analysis of the cowen co. report notesthe big new players in the music industry  alphabet    amazoncom   and apple arent using music as a profit driver. rather they use their respective platforms youtube prime music and apple music as high frequency consumer touch points that reinforce the brand build an ecosystem and generate traffic to higher contributing offerings. thats all true but i think viewing the competitive dynamic between apple and spotify through a financial lens overlooks apples core objective in creating apple music. no apple doesnt need a profitable on demand streaming business and spotify does. however the fact that consumers appear to favor spotify implies that spotify stands a better chance of consolidating what once was a long standing strength of apples ecosystem. this isnt something that translates neatly in dollars and cents but apple views music as a cornerstone of the ios ecosystem which does  drive the overwhelming majority of its profits. put another way the investors business daily   article makes the mistake of viewing the competition financially when musics strategic importance to apples ios is the motivating force behind the product. as the churn metric illustrates apple needs to continue to improve apple music or risk ceding a core aspect of its hotel california esque ecosystem to an able competitor to its long term detriment. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

during the second quarter john linehan the manager of the t rowe price equity income fund   trades   portfolio   purchased a 00NUMBER00 share stake in apple  aapl. apple designs develops and sells consumer electronics computer software and online services. apple has a market cap of 00NUMBER00 billion a pe ratio 00NUMBER00 an enterprise value of 00NUMBER00 billion and a pb ratio 00NUMBER00. according to gurufocus apple has a 00NUMBER00 financial strength rating and a 00NUMBER00 profitability rating. the company has an operating margin of 00NUMBER00 which ranks it above 00NUMBER00 of the companies in the global consumer electronics industry. apple also has an roe of 00NUMBER00 and three year revenue growth of 00NUMBER00 which ranks it above 00NUMBER00 of the companies in its industry. on june 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 linehan was interviewed by steve forbes. linehan gives away some clues during the interview with regards to his investing strategies and potential reasons why he may have purchased a stake in apple during the second quarter. forbes now some investors believe you can just do it off of balance sheet spreadsheets. but you do it on the human side as well. the reason i ask is my grandfather who founded our company liked to say aaayouaaall learn more about the prospects of a company looking at the head knockeraaa thataaas what he called ceos aaathan you will at the balance sheetaaa i. e. people make the difference. you go whole hog in terms of getting to know ceos cfos and the like more than most. linehan well iaaad agree with your grandfather. i think itaaas incredibly important as an investor to understand who youaaare investing with what their motivations are. balance sheets only tell part of story. at the same time valuation balance sheets income statements are interval to our investment process. but theyaaare only part of the story and theyaaare not the full mosaic. forbes so how do you make good picks among equities that are most of these are pretty well followed. itaaas not as if youaaare going into an area that few look at and therefore low hanging fruit. everyoneaaas looking at these things it seems. linehan i think you have to start with the common sense approach in which youaaare looking for companies where you think you have an attractive fundamental backdrop. that really is leveraging the work of our research platform. then on top of that you really have to look for companies where thereaaas some stress or controversy or some factor thataaas affecting sentiment. and if you can buy good companies that are trading with bad investment psychology or bad investment sentiment and you believe that over time that that controversy can be corrected those are the companies that we really gravitate towards. forbes now a company that looks cheap. apple. but you havenaaat take a bite yet. linehan iaaad say in the fund that i co manage we have not taken a bite. as a firm we own a fair amount of apple. forbes yourthis

2016-07-19 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.3070950853521135,0.2384128257725958,-0.0014597177301703,after struggling for several quarters it looks like 00NUMBER00 has finally managed to outsmart its rival in the smartphone segment. at the present stage samsung and apple  aapl   are the two most significant players in the smartphone industry. it appears that samsung has finally defeated apple however by introducing its latest flagship model galaxy 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00. aabefore galaxy 00NUMBER00 and galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge the company made galaxy 00NUMBER00 galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge which lacked many features the galaxy 00NUMBER00 models have. the galaxy 00NUMBER00 models did not have a memory card slot and was not efficiently water proof while the galaxy 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 edge has upgraded ram water proof efficiency and most importantly camera quality. i believe it was samsungaaas strategy to introduce galaxy 00NUMBER00 first so users became attracted to the edge screen with fewer features and then to launch a new upgraded model with all the major advances to force users to upgrade from the 00NUMBER00 models to 00NUMBER00. warning gurufocus has detected 00NUMBER00

predecessors. this trend will likely continue. purchasing joyent is a great moverecently samsung agreed to purchase joyent in order to gain access to access a platform that can be used in its phone iot devices and cloud based services. at present it cannot be said how much joyent could add to the companyaaas bottom line but it can certainly be said that samsung is likely considering speeding up its mobile division where joyent will legitimately exist. according to gartner the value of the public cloud services market is 00NUMBER00 billion at present. the company is now aggressively focusing on cloud software and services and joyent is a rock solid move into the space. this could help samsung gain traction in this wide market which can act as a long term tailwind for samsung investors. conclusionit seems like samsung has outwitted apple in the flagship smartphone segment this year sales of its latest devices are soaring. while appleaaas iphone 00NUMBER00 is yet to hit the market it is highly unlikely that apple would do better this time as samsung has already taken a large chunk of the high end phone market. disclosure  i dont hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned in the article. this article first appeared on gurufocus. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  over on twitter   well known mobile device leaker steve hemmerstoffer tweeted out the following imageimage source weibo via nowherelse. fr. this image is purportedly of apple  snasdaq aapl upcoming iphone lineup. interestingly a number of hemmerstoffers readers were quick to denounce these as fake because under the word iphone there is an s inside of a box. apple began putting this s on the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus phones to denote that those phones were the newer iphone 00NUMBER00 than the older iphone 00NUMBER00. so if these are supposed to be leaks of the iphone 00NUMBER00 the s shouldnt be there rightalthough it is commonly believed that apple will call its next generation phone the iphone 00NUMBER00 and that the follow on to the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be called the iphone 00NUMBER00 skipping over the iphone 00NUMBER00 i dont see why this necessarily has to be the case. in fact from a marketing perspective i could see apple choosing to skip the iphone 00NUMBER00 altogether to jump to the 00NUMBER00. this would make the next iphone seem   at least to many customers like a significant jump. never underestimate the power of clever branding. furthermore apple could easily justify it from a technical perspective. lets took a look at how. this new iphone clearly has an updated industrial design. the antenna lines that run across the top and bottom of the devices body now appear to be gone providing what is broadly viewed as a cleaner look. so the design itself is probably new enough to justify a jump from the 00NUMBER00 series to the 00NUMBER00 series. beyond that though i believe that apple has significant technical innovationsenhancements in store for the devices. processing performance is likely to get a large boost   the camera subsystems should see significant improvements making up for the fairly underwhelming improvements seen in the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus both cellular and wi fi  performance should be up nicely and i think that its about time for a substantially enhanced display   too. the technical improvements that apple is likely to bring to the next device are certainly far more than what one would expect from a typical new number iphone. in fact its probably not unreasonable to argue that the next iphone has all of the improvements that one would expect from a new number phone and  its subsequent s variant all rolled into one. i dont think it would be disingenuous of apple then to call the next iphone the iphone 00NUMBER00. although you can never be 00NUMBER00 sure with these sorts of leaks my inclination is to believe that these tweeted images are legitimate or at the very least are representative of what the next iphone lineup is going to look like. after all the new phones should be announced within the next couple of months so it would be a surprise if leaks at this point werent  legitimate. but as always time will tell. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the

nasdaq inc.  image source apple. early on in the apple  nasdaq aapl 00NUMBER00 iphone rumor cycle kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo floated the idea that the idevice maker might introduce two variants of its next generation 00NUMBER00 inch iphone one with a single lens camera and one with a dual lens camera. however the analyst later revised that prediction saying that the company would only introduce a single version of the next 00NUMBER00 inch iphone. and unsurprisingly it would come with a dual lens camera. but a recent image leaked to the web  shows what appear to be mockups of three distinct iphone models iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and iphone 00NUMBER00 pro. the first two sport single lens rear facing cameras while the last one shows a device thats nearly identical to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus but with a dual lens camera instead. this image has renewed speculation that the idevice maker might be planning to put out not just two but three new phones in this coming product cycle. if apple does release these three new models then i would expect that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus if thats what theyre ultimately called to come in at the same price points as the prior generation models. the pro model featuring the dual lens camera would then come at a premium. this strategy would have the potential to bolster apples average selling prices. indeed for those customers who really value unique camera performance and features the iphone pro could be worth a premium. at the same time apple also appears to be improving its single lens iphone camera as well. the leaks that ive seen show a substantially larger camera lens which could imply that apple will both widen the maximum aperture of the lenses and even transition to a next generation cmos image sensor featuring larger pixels. in other words apple still delivers a generational improvement for the standard iphones while at the same time introducing an interesting new feature in a higher end model for those willing to pay extra. in addition to a dual lens camera apple could opt to endow a potential iphone pro with other specification enhancements to really appeal to those buyers that value such features. after all such a device would likely sell for much more than the standard iphone plus model and apple could restrict the storage sizes on the pro models to say 00NUMBER00 gigabytes and 00NUMBER00 gigabytes to further drive upsell. at much higher prices apple could potentially add features that would otherwise be too cost prohibitive. a higher resolution higher quality display relative to the one found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus for example could make it into a pro model. additional memory and very aggressively binned 00NUMBER00 running at even higher frequencies than typical could also be possibilities. as apple faces intense competition from many lesser known vendors the company needs to be sure to field products that represent the pinnacle of smartphone technology and innovation. a specialized iphone pro model could be the way that apple gets the bleeding edge features that couldnt quite make it into the mainstream iphone models into the hands of consumers. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

largest business. but its fallen on hard times in recent months. last quarter it generated less than 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue and was its second smallest segment. apples management remains steadfast in its commitment to the ipad consistently pointing to popular metrics  of user engagement consumers love their ipads and continue to use them often. they just arent buying new ones. to spark an upgrade cycle apple has worked to add attractive new features to the ipad including the ability to multitask and support for new accessories notably the apple pencil. but the biggest incentive may come later this year almost half of all ipads currently in use will not be able to take advantage of apples forthcoming software update ios 00NUMBER00 which could spark a major upgrade cycle. analytics firm localytics has been tracking the ipad install base for some time. back in march the company published a chart  detailing the current ipad install base. while its possible to draw many inferences from localytics data one thing is abundantly clear consumers are still using a lot of really old ipads. although the situation may have changed slightly in the last three months localytics found that the second most commonly used ipad was the ipad 00NUMBER00 a device first released about 00NUMBER00 years ago. in total the ipad 00NUMBER00 represented about 00NUMBER00 of the ipad install base. other commonly used yet relatively old ipads include the original ipad mini 00NUMBER00 of the install base and the third generation ipad 00NUMBER00. both were released roughly four years ago. to date apple has released 00NUMBER00 different ipad models of 00NUMBER00 will be compatible with ios 00NUMBER00. the original ipad the ipad 00NUMBER00 ipad mini and the third generation ipad are not compatible. if localytics findings are accurate those four models represent a massive 00NUMBER00 of all the ipads currently in use. that means almost half of all ipad owners could be prompted to purchase new models sometime in the near future. ios 00NUMBER00 brings a number of useful new features to the ipad that owners of older models will miss out on including improvements to notifications the lock screen and upgrades to siri and apples virtual keyboard. but the bigger pull could be app compatibility. app creators are free to support older versions of ios and most of them

00NUMBER00 the ipad was a key driver of apples financials generating a significant percentage of its revenue and fueling the companys future prospects. but both statements are increasingly untrue. ipad shipments have declined in each of the last nine consecutive quarters. in that time apples stock has fluctuated significantly in both directions but the ipad was rarely responsible. instead apple investors have turned their attention more to new products like apple watch and apple music as well as apples capital return program and of course the iphone. investors may be overlooking the ipad. a

get it right this time. in april apple earnings included the companys first revenue drop in 00NUMBER00. meanwhile aapl stock dropped 00NUMBER00 and its still struggling to find a footing. even carl icahn sold his shares. so what matters this time as apple earnings roll around according to wall street there are three pivotal issues to watch for if youre an aapl shareholder â€¦ and theyre all related to the iphone. the internet has lit up this week with pictures of what appear to be three new iphones  for september. kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo aka the best apple analyst on the planet according to business insider   tells investors the all new iphone pro will feature a dual lens camera with 00NUMBER00 and high resolution zoom capability. the pro likely will be the same size as the iphone plus but may also feature a smart connector to allow peripheral plug ins and expanded memory. also will offer a third iphone with the same dimensions as the current iphone 00NUMBER00 tech stocks that will be obsolete by 00NUMBER00 cook would be wise to focus on the iphone 00NUMBER00 or any other new iphones rather than explaining away another lackluster apple earnings report. analysts currently forecast earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share a decline of 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago period. while some will lament the lack of an all glass case or oled displays in the upcoming refresh the new iphone provides a far better narrative than third quarter results. things like 00NUMBER00 unit shipments and a 00NUMBER00 billion decline in channel inventories have caused margins to slip about 00NUMBER00 bps to 00NUMBER00 to bloomberg. people appear to have slowed buying ahead of the september refresh. this is not good but its old news. again mr. cook focus on the iphone 00NUMBER00. while aapl dominates premium smartphone sales in the u. s. globally it ranks no. 00NUMBER00 behind samsung   otcmkts  ssnlf    with just 00NUMBER00 of total handset sales according to idc. this represents a huge opportunity. mr. cook needs to articulate a path for how he intends to capture share. bloomberg industries analyst john butler highlights the mid priced iphone se as an excellent way to tap into demand for a smaller form factor iphone which still meets current specs. while premium phones like the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus tend to capture the headlines they represent less than one third of total sales. mid priced versions and even stripped down models far outsell the pricey iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus especially in emerging markets. mr. cooks recent travels abroad attracted a gaggle of press followers and more importantly produced one highly valuable result retail access to india. apple currently sells 00NUMBER00 iphones annually in india. for years it was effectively frozen out of the country by rules that required domestic sourcing. a dinner with prime minister narendra modi changed that. forbes  reports that aapl plans to open stores imminently and will gain direct access to indias 00NUMBER00 billion people nearly as many as live in china. china generated 00NUMBER00 billion in sales for apple last year or 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue. if apple can turn india into another china neither last quarters belly flop nor next tuesdays perfunctory report will matter. mr. cook tell us about the future. adam johnson is founder

on july 00NUMBER00 analysts are expecting a painful 00NUMBER00 year over year decline in the tech giants earnings per share. this is a particularly steep decline in eps considering analysts are anticipating a meaningfully more modest year over year decline in revenue of 00NUMBER00 during the same period. the bleak outlook for apples earnings highlights why the stock is trading at just 00NUMBER00 earnings at the time of this writing. image source the motley fool. but what exactly is the key driver behind apples much lower eps this quarter compared to the year ago quarter one major reason analysts are expecting eps to fall faster than revenue is the companys contracting gross profit margin. with the help of apples launch of iphone 00NUMBER00 in sept. 00NUMBER00 the tech giants gross profit margins began to improve significantly. soaring iphone sales and higher priced iphones benefited the companys gross profit margin. largely driven by pent up demand for iphones with larger displays iphone sales jumped about 00NUMBER00 the first full quarter of the iphone 00NUMBER00 lineups availability. as apples most profitable product segment iphone accounting for more of its total revenue meant its corporate gross profit margin received a nice boost. furthermore the new lineup boasted a higher priced flagship iphone option in its first plus version and apple also introduced a third and more expensive storage tier with 00NUMBER00 gb. together more expensive purchase options drove the average selling price for iphone higher in the upcoming quarters and higher selling prices for apples iphones also meant the companys gross profit margin increased as its more expensive iphone models boasted higher profit margins. between the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 and the fourth quarter 00NUMBER00 apples gross profit margin increased from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. data for chart retrieved from apple quarterly sec filings. asterisk indicates management guidance midpoint of guidance range. chart source author. but now the same factors that were recently working for  apples gross profit margin are now working against  it. apples iphone sales have turned downward and its average selling price is declining. in apples most recent quarter iphone unit sales declined 00NUMBER00 year over year iphone average selling price declined almost 00NUMBER00 and the companys gross profit margin subsequently narrowed from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. for apples third fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 the continued trend of declining iphone sales is expected to negatively impact the companys gross profit margin again. for 00NUMBER00 management said it expects its gross profit margin to be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00  down from 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. as apples gross profit margin narrows its leveraging the negative impact of apples falling revenue on the companys earnings making net income and earnings per share fall more steeply. in the near term theres no quick solution to apples declining gross profit margin. indeed comparisons could get even worse going forward if the company keeps up with its new strategy of introducing lower cost iphones. in late march apple broke from its normal annual iphone cycle and released its lowest priced new iphone ever iphone se. with a starting price of 00NUMBER00 the smaller iphone costs a whopping 00NUMBER00 less than the starting price of apples lowest priced flagship iphone 00NUMBER00. if apple continues to beef up its offerings at lower price points this could begin to erode the companys gross profit margin even further. fortunately apples conservative price to earnings ratio 00NUMBER00 prices in current gross profit margin headwinds. but if this negative gross profit margin trend continues to erode profitability as fast as it has in recent quarters even into the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle investors may have to rethink the companys ability to sustain current levels of profitability. a secret billion

growth has slowed down considerably but that doesnt take away from the fact that it still generates a very high level of cash flows. the companys shares have picked up some steam recently but they are still trading at a 00NUMBER00 discount compared to all time highs. with all this in mind should you buy aapl stock ahead of earningsapple looks like a solid candidate for the long run and fundamental value metrics suggest that the stock is relatively cheap right now. it trades at a forward pe of 00NUMBER00 and its peg is relatively tame at 00NUMBER00. while this is what youd want to see from a bargain standpoint it is important to factor in this years expected sales and earnings decline of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. apples sales have stagnated in china and other geographic areas where the company had hoped it would generate more sales growth from over the long term. apple has also struggled to diversify its revenues and the company heavily relies on the iphone to drive strong sales numbers. in the second quarter iphone revenues accounted 00NUMBER00 of total sales. there is risk in this but apple is acquiring other companies and it is aggressively trying to expand its reach in the tech space. apples products and services are all great with regards to satisfying consumers and while it might be wise to bet on its performance in the long run there are short term factors which stand to affect where its share price goes from here. earnings expectationsanalysts have been revising their earnings expectations downwards for the current quarter this year and next year. over the last two months no analysts have revised their earnings outlook on apple upwards. eight analysts have revised their eps expectations downwards for the current quarter and two of those analysts have updated their estimates as recently as seven days ago. the recent revisions suggest that new information has been implemented into the forecasts and the new data could end up making apples earnings lower than the figures our current consensus estimate calls for. over the last 00NUMBER00 days our eps consensus has dropped from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. this represents 00NUMBER00 reduction compared to our estimate three months ago. the negative earnings momentum for apple makes it look like an unattractive purchase right now and this is why it is a zacks 00NUMBER00 sell. buying now

companys struggling stock price. aapl  data by ycharts. looking beyond the next quarter or two long term investors certainly should see plenty to like  in  apple stock. and though apples primary financial engine the iphone  may indeed underwhelm theres even reason for optimism in other areas of apples idevice lineup later this year. after launching its inaugural smartwatch last april apple decided to bypass its well worn 00NUMBER00 month device update schedule for the apple watch earlier this year. instead the company refreshed the apple watchs software and released several new styles of watchbands which despite its marketing platitudes amounted to little more than a moderate improvement. as such more so than the ipad or iphone the apple watch heads toward the holiday season in dire need of an upgrade. thankfully one appears to be on the docket. according to a number of reports apple will debut the second generation apple watch as part of its standard pre holiday season product refresh cycle. the company reportedly already ramped its components purchases for the second generation apple watch with component shipments from suppliers reportedly commencing in 00NUMBER00. image source apple. according to digitimes   apples component orders have thus far proven more robust than many suppliers expected given the disappointing sales of the original apple watch. this suggests that apple whose supply chain mastery is widely acknowledged at this point expects an increase in demand for the forthcoming apple watch. sources within apples asian supply chain have estimated that the new pace of component orders implies a sales rate of 00NUMBER00 million units each month. of equal note as many will likely infer this suggests apples next watch will include at least some of the features many hoped would appear in the original apple watch. apple had grand ambitions for its original apple watch particularly regarding its breakthrough potential in healthcare. however the tech giant reportedly scrapped features to remove many of the more exciting features during the development process because of quality control issues. what about this time aroundmultiple credible sources claim apple plans to embed cellular connectivity directly in this years apple watch. this means data usage and processing will remain siloed entirely within the latest apple watch removing the devices remora like dependency on the iphone for many simple tasks like messaging. reports unsurprisingly assert the next generation apple watch will also enjoy the usual hardware upgrades  namely better faster stronger etc. which also sounds entertainingly similar to the famous daft punk song found in virtually every apple hardware refresh. whats less clear is whether apple will manage to include any watershed new technologies into the next apple watch. image image source apple. numerous unsubstantiated reports have claimed that apple will indeed include the much ballyhooed smart band capable of monitoring important health data such as blood oxygen levels respiratory rate blood pressure and body temperature and perhaps more. however in the absence of reliable reporting on the matter investors would do well to temper their enthusiasm for such features making it into the upcoming device though apple appears as interested as ever in adding such features in the long term. this time around it appears at least some of the original and most promising features envisioned for last years apple watch many indeed be ready for their moment in the sun. recall apple didnt truly nail the smartphone until it debuted the second generation iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. said another way creating devices that have true game changing potential takes time and iteration even for a company as skilled in consumer electronics as apple. so while the forthcoming apple watch may not include every feature consumers hope for it should still mark an important step forward for the idevice kingpin. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

that  considering a diverse range of insights  makes us better investors. the motley fool has a disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  for many years apple  nasdaq aapl avoided the low price market choosing to let consumers looking to save a few bucks on an apple device buy older models of its iphones ipads and macintosh computers. that was a sensible strategy that may have cost the company some customers while preserving its premium image. apple devices were not windows or android machines that could be had cheaply. the company was akin to luxury automobile brands which do not slap their name on low end models. apple however deviated from its premium strategy when it released iphone se earlier this year a lower priced version of its popular phone. that may have proven to be a bad idea as new research shows that owners of older phones often chose the se rather than the current pricier 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus models. ultimately that could eat into the companys bottom line because iphone accounts for about 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue. apple offers the high end iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus as well as the budget friendly se. image source apple. new research from consumer intelligence research partners cirp estimates that in the most recent quarter the first quarter when the new cheaper iphone se was on sale and the third full quarter for iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus the se accounted 00NUMBER00 of total iphone sales in the united states with iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus at 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 are also still selling. the latest sales estimates would be good news for the company if the se buyers brought new users into the companys fold but that does not appear to be the case. at least for this u. s. data. in this quarter the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus accounted for 00NUMBER00 total sales said cirp partner josh lowitz in a press release  opens in pdf. in contrast a year ago in the june 00NUMBER00 their predecessors the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus had 00NUMBER00 of total sales. a year ago the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus grew their share of total iphone sales relative to the previous quarter up 00NUMBER00 in the march 00NUMBER00 quarter. in this quarter the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus saw their share shrink relative to the march 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. basically instead of upgrading to the current top tier phone people with older apple models have elected for the cheaper se. cirp reported that among iphone se buyers 00NUMBER00 upgraded from an older iphone while 00NUMBER00 of iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus buyers upgraded from an older iphone and the number was only 00NUMBER00 of iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus buyers. that would still be fine for the company if the new model was also converting android users but that does not appear to be whats happening. iphone se appears to have appealed to owners of much older iphone and less to switchers from android and other operating systems said cirp partner mike levin in the press release. on the one hand the se may have persuaded these owners of older iphones to upgrade to a new phone and possibly remain with apple ios. on the other hand with its much lower retail price iphone se also may have diverted these customers from purchasing a more expensive iphone 00NUMBER00 series phone which will likely lead to a lower asp average selling price in the quarter. with the se apple walks a very narrow tightrope. the company wants to use the cheaper model to keep users of older phones with the company while also luring in android users. what it does not want to do is give people who would have bought a top tier model a path to spend less. the company appears to be successful in getting users of old iphones to consider the se rather than leaving for a cheaper android phone. thats good news perhaps but its also possible many if not most of those customers would have eventually upgraded to a more expensive apple model. the vast majority of iphone users 00NUMBER00 according to research from kantar   intend to buy another apple phone. where apple has fallen short with the se is the new model has not grown the user base but has apparently hurt sales of its higher priced sister phones. apple has made it cheaper for people to be in the ios ecosystem but in doing so has cost itself sales of its premium product at a time when the company was coming off its first down quarter for iphone since it was introduced in 00NUMBER00. ultimately thats bad news for shareholders because its really apple selling against itself by giving consumers a cheaper option. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few

for global economic growth. the bric brazil russia india and china countries boasted massive economic growth rates and to be honest at some point it did appear as though nothing could stop them. but chinaaaas production driven economy has been tested severally over the last few years and it has now become a major hurdle for the global economic growth. without china hitting its previous economic growth predictions world economic evaluators like the imf have had to revise the numbers downwards. on the other hand brazil and russia have had their own fair share of trouble and all of a sudden the bric nations that seemed crucial to global economic growth are now down to just one india. india is now seen as one of the few shining lights in the hope for improvement in the global economic growth. even the worldaaas largest company by market capitalizationaa apple   aapl   has realized the opportunity in india and has made plans to capture as much a percentage of the smartphone market in the country as possible. ss many locally based columnists would say however this southwest asian nation could also follow the path created by its fellow bric nations. the housing market is one of the driving forces behind indiaaaas promising economic growth. as the worldaaas second most populous country behind china there is a lot of demand for property ownership in india. this is not the residential housing demand but also for commercial and office space. as uma shashikant points out in indiaaaas economic times most people are looking to have a share of the property market cake. she also warns against overdoing the investment in real estate. as more people push to own property prices will continue to skyrocket. this is in spite of the complicated process and risk involved in completing transactions. two years ago fears that the country may be thriving in a property bubble emerged. while there are only a few cities that could be under threat from a potential bubble burst property listings in the country indicate that there are limited places where you can find competitive rates for owning or renting property either residential or commercial. now one of the main advantages of conducting business in the emerging markets and especially india has been the low cost of doing business. labor is cheap and so has been the price of land and office space. this is probably why companies like apple and samsung 00NUMBER00 among several others in different sectors have opted to set shop in these regions. india is now the worldaaas second biggest smartphone market behind china at least according to apple ceo tim cook. cook told analysts in april that he views india as where china was seven 00NUMBER00 years agoaaa with regard to the smartphone market. warning

quarter ended in june on tuesday july 00NUMBER00 after official market hours. this report will cover the companys fiscal third quarter. shares of the iphone maker are under considerable pressure due to fears about decelerating growth so the coming earnings report from apple will be closely scrutinized by investors. apple stock  is down roughly 00NUMBER00 in the last year and this disappointing performance is mostly due to the fact that sales are moving in the wrong direction. total revenue during the quarter ended in march amounted to 00NUMBER00 billion a 00NUMBER00 decline from the same quarter in 00NUMBER00. adding to the concerns management is expecting revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion in the june ended quarter which would be a 00NUMBER00 decline over the same period last year at the middle of the range. units in thousands. data source apple sec filings. apple generates nearly 00NUMBER00 of revenue from the iphone segment so this product is crucial for the business. overall growth in the smartphone industry is slowing because of increasing market penetration. in addition the iphone 00NUMBER00 was an explosive success for apple in 00NUMBER00 making year over year comparisons particularly challenging in 00NUMBER00. the company sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones in the march ended quarter a 00NUMBER00 decline from the same period in 00NUMBER00 still up by 00NUMBER00 from the corresponding period in 00NUMBER00. the good news is that the analyst bar is already quite low for apple leading to the report. as a reaction to disappointing performance last quarter wall street analysts have substantially reduced their earnings forecasts for the quarter ending in june. aapl eps estimates for current quarter  data by ycharts. while profit margin and earnings are undeniably important elements of financial performance revenue will most likely be a key area of focus among investors. the average sales estimate from the analysts following the company is 00NUMBER00 billion. the figure is in line with the companys guidance and it would represent a decline of 00NUMBER00 year over year. since the iphone accounts for the lions share of revenue sales volume and pricing in this segment is of utmost importance. the latest incarnation the iphone se was available at the stores on march 00NUMBER00 and apple ceo tim cook said in the last earnings conference call that demand for the revamped 00NUMBER00 inch device was exceeding supply. the iphone se is priced at cheaper levels than other iphone models with a starting price of 00NUMBER00. the product seems to be specially targeted at gaining market share in emerging markets where income levels are lower the carrier subsidy model is not as extensive as in the u. s. and apple products are too expensive for many consumers. china is becoming an increasingly important market for apple sales in the country account for nearly 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. as the chinese smartphone market is getting saturated however chinas economic slowdown and currency volatility could have a considerable impact on sales figures in a particular period. apple reported a 00NUMBER00 decline in revenue from the greater china region last quarter and this was a major drag on company level performance. the services segment is another particularly interesting area to watch. apple produced 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue from this division last quarter and the business is now bigger than both the ipad and the mac. services accounts for 00NUMBER00 of total revenue and sales jumped 00NUMBER00 year over year last quarter. the services segment includes revenue from the itunes store the app store apple pay and more. investors would really appreciate sustained growth from this segment in the coming earnings report. even if its quantitative impact on the overall business is still modest it can be quite relevant from a qualitative point of view. thats because while hardware sales are volatile and hard to predict services tend to be recurrent and more stable. the maturation of the smartphone market is a major headwind for apple in terms of growth opportunities over the years ahead. with this in mind if apple can capitalize its massive installed user base of more than 00NUMBER00 billion active devices to drive sustained growth from the services business it could see big positives in terms of future growth visibility. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for

the company is expected to post quarterly earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share down from 00NUMBER00 during the same period last year. the stock is starting to recover but remains down 00NUMBER00 the year. aapl was recently trading at 00NUMBER00 down 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 month high and 00NUMBER00 above its 00NUMBER00 month low. technical indicators for aapl are bearish and the stock is showing signs of a possible trend reversal. the stock has recent support above 00NUMBER00 recent resistance below 00NUMBER00. of the 00NUMBER00 analysts who cover the stock 00NUMBER00 rate it a strong buy three rate it a buy four rate it a hold and one rates it a strong sell. the stock receives sp capital iqs 00NUMBER00 stars strong buy ranking. apple shares have been under pressure for the last year with wall street showing concern over  iphone sales as well as its exposure in china. the companys earnings have been declining but even with the lower earnings apple still enjoy big profits and with new iphone models on the horizon the stock should remain stable barring a huge earnings miss. wall street has already priced the earnings decline into the stock and with a current pe of 00NUMBER00 there is not a lot of downside risk. as always all eyes will be on apples report and the greatest attention will be paid to iphone sales. the iphone accounts for a massive 00NUMBER00 of the companys overall revenue so it is understandable why so much attention is placed on iphone sales numbers. this is typically apples weakest quarter and this could mark the first time that  iphone sales have fallen year over year for two straight quarters. another problem is that apples margins have probably contracted as well a result of the lower cost iphone se. while the company will almost certainly post results weaker than shareholders are used to there is already so much negativity priced into the stock that the downside appears to be limited and there is plenty of upside potential if there is even a hint of strength in the iphone segment. the short term outlook may be less than impressive for the stock but the long term outlook is solid as iphone shipments are expected to grow again towards the end of the year when the new iphone models are launched. if you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on aapl consider a september 00NUMBER00 bull put credit spread for a 00NUMBER00 cent credit. thats a potential 00NUMBER00 return 00NUMBER00 annualized and the stock would have to fall 00NUMBER00 to cause a problem. if you want to take a bearish stance on the stock at this time consider a september 00NUMBER00 bear call credit spread for a 00NUMBER00. thats a potential 00NUMBER00 return 00NUMBER00 annualized and the stock would have to rise 00NUMBER00 to cause a problem. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc. originally published on investorsobservercom apple  nasdaq aapl gave fans of its smaller phones something to cheer about earlier this year releasing the new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se. in addition to being smaller than apples flagship phones the iphone se is also its cheapest iphone ever with a starting price of just 00NUMBER00 in the u. s. that low price has some analysts concerned that the iphone se is cannibalizing sales of more expensive phones from the iphone 00NUMBER00 line. however these fears may be overstated as many consumers have strong preferences about smartphone size. some analysts fear that the iphone se is cannibalizing 00NUMBER00 series sales. image source apple. since going on sale at the end of march the iphone se has claimed a respectable slice of total iphone sales. according to research firm consumer intelligence research partners the iphone se accounted 00NUMBER00 of apples iphone sales  in the u. s. last quarter. that was still well behind the sales shares of the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00. cirp noted that the combined domestic sales share of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 is well below the 00NUMBER00 domestic sales share achieved by the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the year earlier quarter. thus apple probably faced an unfavorable shift in the iphone sales mix last quarter with a higher proportion of buyers opting for cheaper models. its not necessarily good for apple that the iphone se is selling well. that depends on how much the iphone se is cannibalizing sales of high end models like the iphone 00NUMBER00 versus expanding the market. as cirp co founder josh lowitz statedon the one hand the se may have persuaded these owners of older iphones to upgrade to a new phone and possibly remain with apple ios. on the other hand with its much lower retail price iphone se also may have diverted these customers from purchasing a more expensive iphone 00NUMBER00 series phone which will likely lead to a lower asp in the quarter. fortunately for apple the former reason appears to have been more prevalent. a lot of iphone users who prefer smaller phones had been holding out for a new 00NUMBER00 inch model and the iphone se spurred them to upgrade. this can be seen from the surprisingly large proportion of iphone se buyers who were upgrading from very old iphones. a third of iphone se buyers upgraded from pre iphone 00NUMBER00 models  primarily the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 according to cirp. another third of iphone se buyers came from somewhat newer iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones. many iphone se buyers had held onto their old iphones for a long time. image source apple. clearly most of these users have had plenty of opportunities to upgrade before. had apple not released a new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone they may have held onto their aging phones indefinitely or even abandoned the ios ecosystem entirely. obviously there has been some cannibalization of the iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 by the iphone se. many users have a strong preference either for larger phones or smaller phones but theres also a middle ground of people who would have been happy with a more expensive iphone but instead bought an iphone se  because it was available. nevertheless there was clearly a large pool of pent up demand for smaller phones ahead of the iphone se launch earlier this year. after the initial rush of iphone fans desperate for bigger phones in late 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 iphone sales have started to slow. yet there are still hundreds of millions of people around the world using pre iphone 00NUMBER00 devices. back in january apple ceo tim cook stated that only 00NUMBER00 of iphone users had upgraded to the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 series models. what have these customers been waiting for if not a new 00NUMBER00 inch designthus the launch of this new 00NUMBER00 inch iphone model could spur millions of incremental upgrades over the next year. that should easily outweigh the impact of some customers trading down from pricier models. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall

worlds biggest and arguably most recognizable company post weaker year over year revenue as well as earnings in the prior quarter but it fell short of earnings expectations for the first time in years

fear the situation hasnt changed much. are investors right to be concerned is apple a has been unable to reignite its growth rates from not too long ago the jurys still out on the matter but the upcoming apple earnings report may not go a long way in answering the question. apple is expected to report a top line of 00NUMBER00 billion and a bottom line of 00NUMBER00 per share of aapl stock for the quarter ending on june 00NUMBER00. the results for the companys third fiscal quarter 00NUMBER00 will come after tuesdays closing bell. both numbers would be well below the same quarters figures from a year earlier. revenue is expected to have fallen 00NUMBER00 from the year ago top line of 00NUMBER00 billion while earnings are projected to fall 00NUMBER00 from profits of 00NUMBER00 per share. 00NUMBER00 stocks with more upside than apple inc. aaplwaning iphone sales are the biggest culprit in the demise of apples past and projected numbers. they account for roughly two thirds of the companys revenue and analysts expect another sizable year over year drop in unit sales for the third fiscal quarter. after falling 00NUMBER00 in the previous quarter the pros are calling for sales of about 00NUMBER00 million iphones for the recently completed quarter. that figure would be down 00NUMBER00 versus the 00NUMBER00 tally 00NUMBER00 million iphones sold for 00NUMBER00. services things like apple pay apps and itunes are expected to generate 00NUMBER00 billion worth of revenue up 00NUMBER00 on a year over year basis matching the year over year growth rate the services division mustered in 00NUMBER00. on a sequential basis though that wouldnt be any better than 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billion in services revenue. obviously several factors are in play with apple here but some are going to push the value of aapl stock around more than others. the three biggest influences are in no certain 00NUMBER00. iphone sales  although apple is working diligently to get away from so much reliance on the big but volatile revenue contribution makes to the companys top line its still the breadwinnner and probably will be for a while. thats what makes the recent deterioration of its sales numbers so alarming. not everyone feels this weak patch is a permanent problem however. morgan stanley analyst katy huberty recently suggested we expect apple to report in line june quarter results and guide september quarter slightly below consensus estimates. we like the set up as iphone growth likely troughed in june and we expect a more revolutionary iphone cycle next year anticipating the 00NUMBER00 and then the iphone 00NUMBER00 will reignite new purchase demand while accelerating the upgrade cycle. 00NUMBER00. services  tim cook seems to have finally embraced the fact that sales of razor blades should be given the same time and effort as sales of razors. that is to say an iphone or an ipad or a mac isnt just a profit center in and of itself. its a platform from which another important profit center can be grown sales of things like digital music apps and apple pay just to name a few. services is a relatively small piece of the pie but its growing fast. it also produces very high margin revenue. some have anticipated apples service business ambition would hit a wall sooner than later. what that doubt doesnt recognize however is that the company has only scratched the surface of the 00NUMBER00 users of apple devices   most of whom dont fully utilize what that device can do. 00NUMBER00. china  although china has been nothing but a headache for apple over the course of the past several months if aapl is really going to fire on all cylinders it needs to be able to compete there. it hasnt been easy. in june the iphone 00NUMBER00 was banned from sale in china  until a patent dispute with a chinese phonemaker had been settled. earlier in the year the prc government shutdown apples ibook and itunes movie division. in the past apple has been the victim of a celebrity shaming campaign in china. putting it all together and more it makes it tough for apple to market to the countrys 00NUMBER00 consumers. while the rhetoric is grim dont be shocked if the apple earnings report tuesday evening is better than expected the numbers are low and likely meant to be beat. but it wont mean much if theyre beat now will it mean much if theyre not. the value of aapl stock is about where the company can prove its going six months from now. iphone saturation is a legitimate problem and though some observers think the iphone 00NUMBER00 and especially the iphone 00NUMBER00 could create heroic demand they were saying the same thing about the iphone 00NUMBER00 and its initial demand fizzled pretty quickly. ditto for the iphone 00NUMBER00. amzn is amazon stock a buy near all time highsmeanwhile services revenue is expected to have stagnated sequentially. while this still is a huge opportunity apple hasnt exactly figured out how to convert services into big time revenue. in other words apples 00NUMBER00 earnings wont predict a grim or a fruitful future. dont read too much into them either way. the report is mostly just a place holder as apple is en route to something else. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. yhoo 00NUMBER00 things we learned from yahoos

watchlist at stock options channel is apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the november 00NUMBER00 expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the november 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the

shares climbed as high as 00NUMBER00 in after hours trading as investors digested the implications of the news. apple reported earnings per share of 00NUMBER00. while this figure was down 00NUMBER00 compared with apples eps in the year ago quarter it was higher than the consensus analyst estimate for eps 00NUMBER00. total revenue was 00NUMBER00 billion down 00NUMBER00 from its revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion in the year ago quarter. analysts were expecting apple to report third quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00. we are pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated at the start of the quarter said apple ceo tim cook in the companys earnings release. the late march introduced iphone se was a highlight during the quarter. 00NUMBER00 was its first full quarter of availability and cook said the launch of the lower priced iphone was very successful. its worth emphasizing that the iphone se was supply constrained  for much of apples third quarter so the lower cost iphones start despite its constraints highlights a promising opportunity for the tech giant. apples guidance for its fourth quarter importantly included expectations for a narrower year over year decline in revenue than in the current quarter. apple guided for fourth quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. the midpoint of this guidance range represents a 00NUMBER00 year over year decline for 00NUMBER00  better than the apples second quarter revenue decline 00NUMBER00. the quarter marks an important milestone for investors for several reasons. first it shows the company is moderating its revenue decline by reporting better than expected results and by guiding for a smaller decline in 00NUMBER00. second and perhaps more importantly it previews what could become a key market for apple lower priced iphones. stay tuned to the motley fool  for some deeper analysis of apples third quarter results. a secret

to the news sending shares of the iphone maker up by nearly 00NUMBER00 in after hours trading. lets look at the recent earnings announcement from apple and see what it means for investors in the company going forward. the smartphone industry is maturing and the iphone 00NUMBER00 was a booming success for apple in 00NUMBER00 which makes year over year comparisons quite challenging in 00NUMBER00. in this context management guidance was for a decline of approximately 00NUMBER00 in revenue during the third quarter and sales figures came in ahead of those forecasts. revenue was 00NUMBER00 billion during the third quarter a 00NUMBER00 versus the same quarter last year but apple still outperformed expectations of 00NUMBER00 billion among wall street analysts following the company. earnings per share of 00NUMBER00 also outperformed analysts expectations for 00NUMBER00 per share. forward looking guidance can be even more important than revenue during the past quarter and that number was also encouraging. for the fourth quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 the company expects revenue of between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. those figures compare favorably with the average analyst estimate 00NUMBER00. apple ceo tim cook said in the press release that the business outperformed management expectations and that demand for the iphone se looks quite promising. in his own words we are pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated at the start of the quarter. we had a very successful launch of iphone se and were thrilled by customers and developers response to software and services we previewed at wwdc in june. the iphone accounted for nearly 00NUMBER00 of total revenue during the quarter so this segment is of utmost importance in terms of overall company level financial performance. apple sold 00NUMBER00 iphone units during the third quarter. that was a 00NUMBER00 decline but it still beat analysts expectations 00NUMBER00 million units. investors shouldnt put too much attention on wall street forecasts when analyzing a business. looking at a company with a long term perspective is a far smarter and more productive approach to investing decisions. nevertheless when trying to understand the markets reaction to the earnings announcement its important to keep in mind that revenue came in ahead of expectations even if sales declined year over year. strong performance from the iphone se is quite encouraging. the iphone se has a comparatively low starting price of 00NUMBER00 a two year contract considerably cheaper than the 00NUMBER00 price for the iphone 00NUMBER00. because of a big sales contribution from the iphone se during the quarter the average selling price in the iphone segment declined from 00NUMBER00 in the third quarter of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. still the impact on profit margins wasnt too big gross profit margin was 00NUMBER00 of revenue last quarter compared 00NUMBER00 in the year ago period. this performance indicates that management is doing a sound job of offering a more competitively priced product while still producing healthy profitability for investors alleviating concerns about the possibility of a big decline in earnings from shrinking margins. the iphone se is particularly targeted at attracting new clients to the sticky apple ecosystem. not only is the device selling better than expected but the negative impact on profitability is also quite modest and this is arguably the main positive in the recently released earnings report. another major plus in the report is vigorous growth in the services division which includes revenue from the itunes store the app store apple pay apple care and other services. revenue in this business grew 00NUMBER00 year over year reaching almost 00NUMBER00 during the quarter. the services segment is now the second largest segment behind the iphone representing 00NUMBER00 of total apple revenue. iphone sales tend to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter making apples financial performance hard to predict. on the other hand services tend to be recurrent and more stable so a growing contribution from the services segment in the overall revenue mix will make performance more stable in the future. expectations were admittedly low for apple leading up to the report but the company still managed to beat a low bar on the back of strong performance from the iphone se and the services business. this news has positive implications going forward so its no wonder  apple stock  was rising steeply after the announcement. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few

expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  after months of concern that the worlds largest company by market cap was a dead investment apple aapl has showed theres a few more aces up its sleeve. fiscal third quarter earnings came in better than expected led by strength in the iphone. much of this can be attributed to strength in the iphone se apples newest iphone which was announced in march without much fanfare. as a result it sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones in the quarter ahead of the 00NUMBER00 million wall street was expecting something thats been a drag on the stock for quite some time. investors have been concerned that the iphone is no longer the growth business it once was and even though unit sales are slipping still apple forecast for the fourth quarter it would once again see unit sales decline its not as bad as investors expected which is a good sign at least for now. its also a positive sign that the ipad which saw 00NUMBER00 million units sold in the quarter had revenue growth this quarter something it hasnt seen in quite some time. the same goes for the mac which shipped 00NUMBER00 million units also above estimates. the iphone se priced at 00NUMBER00 and up is likely to help apple smooth out shipments in the fiscal third and fourth quarters when shipments are a little bit weaker than the other two other quarters. ceo tim cook called out the se in the earnings release making the newest addition to the iphone lineup an important one for apple even if it didnt garner a lot of hype and attention from the press and was mostly seen as a ho hum product. the companys fourth quarter guidance was better than what wall street was expecting between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion and the companys services business which cook told cnbc would be the size of a fortune 00NUMBER00 company by next year grew 00NUMBER00 year over year. this portion of the business is likely to continue to get increased focus over the coming year with the inclusion of apple music app store itunes apple care and others helping stem the tide of the slowing smartphone growth. apple is a company still looking to turn the ship around from being mostly dependent on the iphone a look at the companys rd spending shows its not sitting on its laurels to focusing on other areas so its not out of the woods yet. however for the first time in a while its clearer there is light at the end of the tunnel for the cupertino calif. based apple. and thats a welcomed sign for investors no matter which screen theyre reading it on. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. back in march apple  nasdaq aapl unveiled the iphone se. the se for those of you unfamiliar with the product is essentially the guts of an 00NUMBER00 in the shell of the older iphone 00NUMBER00. it starts at 00NUMBER00 for the model with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of flash storage and goes to 00NUMBER00 for the model with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of flash storage. according to apple ceo tim cook demand for the iphone se was greater than supply throughout the third quarter. the good news though is that cook says the company was able to achieve supplydemand balance as apple entered the september quarter. lets take a closer look at what else apples management had to say about the iphone se and what the future of this product category may hold. cook seemed upbeat about the iphone se noting that the device is opening the door to customers that apple wasnt reaching before. this is presumably in reference to the lower price of the device. on top of that though cook says that the iphone se probably helped to convince those potential customers that wanted new iphones but wanted it in a 00NUMBER00 inch form factor to finally pull the trigger on the iphone se. according to cook the iphone ses popularity isnt limited to specific regions he says that its proving to be popular in both developed and emerging markets. additionally the executive said that the percentage of iphone se sales going to customers who are new to iphone is greater than apple has seen in the first weeks of availability for other iphones launched in the last several years. given that apple is placing an increased emphasis around opening up additional revenue streams tied to the iphone installed base the success of the iphone se in growing the installed base certainly seems like a long term positive for the company. the introduction of the iphone se was expected to negatively impact the companys iphone average selling prices and according to cfo luca maestri it did just that. the rollout of our new entry level iphone se concurrent with the channel reduction of more than 00NUMBER00 million higher end iphones resulted in a lower than usual iphone average selling price 00NUMBER00 maestri told investors. however even though the iphone se serves as a drag on iphone average selling prices it doesnt appear to have too much of an impact on the companys gross profit margin percentage. from a gross margin perspective iphone se is slightly dilutive to company margins but the impact is not particularly large maestri explained. it looks like apple did a good job with the cost structure of the iphone se relative to its selling price. i get the impression that apple management is surprised by both the initial performance of the iphone se in the marketplace and  by the types of customers its reaching. the iphone se seems to have been mainly targeted at those customers either unwilling or unable to pay a premium price for the companys premium flagship iphones. cooks commentary around the form factor driving users simply interested in sticking with small iphones to finally upgrade appears to indicate that even apple is surprised that there are non trivial numbers of iphone customers uninterested in moving

investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  on tuesday apple  nasdaq aapl reported a second consecutive quarter of double digit declines in revenue and earnings. however the results outpaced the midpoint of apples april guidance and were also better than what analysts had expected. apple hasnt lost its mojo notwithstanding skeptics claims to the contrary. image source the motley fool. even more importantly apple achieved these results while dramatically reducing its channel inventory. this means underlying demand for apples products was much better than the numbers in the earnings release would imply. furthermore apple expects demand trends to remain solid going forward. apples revenue fell 00NUMBER00 year over year last quarter 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. this was still a tad better than the average analyst estimate of 00NUMBER00 billion. the drop was driven entirely by the iphone apples top selling product by far. iphone unit sales declined 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 million. analysts had expected apple to sell about 00NUMBER00 million iphones. iphone revenue declined at an even faster 00NUMBER00 rate. the iphones average selling price plunged nearly 00NUMBER00 year over year from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 largely because of the introduction and strong sales of the new lower priced iphone se. the strong dollar also likely contributed somewhat to the asp decline. meanwhile apples earnings per share slumped 00NUMBER00 falling 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 a year earlier but edging ahead of the analyst consensus of 00NUMBER00. gross margin reached the high end of apples guidance range at 00NUMBER00. earlier this year apple decided it should take a more conservative approach to inventory management because of macroeconomic weakness and slowing sales in many markets. as a result apple executives warned investors that the companys 00NUMBER00 would be negatively impacted by channel inventory reductions. apple significantly reduced its channel inventory in 00NUMBER00  especially for the iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. on apples april earnings call cfo luca maestri stated that the company planned to reduce its channel inventory by more 00NUMBER00 billion during the third quarter. by contrast it reduced channel inventory by less than 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00 of the 00NUMBER00 year. however apple ultimately reduced its channel inventory by a stunning 00NUMBER00 billion during the quarter. thus if apple had stuck to its original plan for channel inventory its revenue would have been about 00NUMBER00 billion higher blowing by both top line and bottom line expectations. apples channel inventory reductions had the effect of downplaying demand for the companys products. for example apple reduced iphone channel inventory by more than 00NUMBER00 million units. so while the company reported a 00NUMBER00 year over year decline in iphone unit sales sell through to end users was down just 00NUMBER00 a year earlier. with channel inventory now very lean apple is poised to deliver better results going forward. the company expects revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion in 00NUMBER00 which would represent a year over year decline of just under 00NUMBER00 at the midpoint. even this relatively solid guidance may prove conservative depending on when apple starts to sell the next generation iphone. after all on a sell through basis apples revenue was down a little less than 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 and the year over year revenue comparisons will be easier in 00NUMBER00. furthermore upgrade demand should improve once the next generation iphone arrives. most importantly analysts estimates for the upcoming 00NUMBER00 year seem too low based on the underlying demand trends at apple. even if the iphone 00NUMBER00 doesnt offer any revolutionary new features its likely to stimulate more upgrade demand than the iphone 00NUMBER00 product cycle did. this should drive a much greater revenue rebound than the modest 00NUMBER00 uptick analysts currently expect. as investors start to recognize that the outlook for apple is better than feared  apple stock  should start to regain some of the ground it has lost in the past year. a secret billion dollar

points in 00NUMBER00 year over year. despite the decline shares traded 00NUMBER00 higher during the first trading day after the report. apples wildly conservative valuation came to the rescue. heres a closer look at the companys third quarter results  and why investors are pleased. going into 00NUMBER00 it was already clear apple would post another quarter of year over year declines in revenue and eps. not only did management guide for a comparatively worse third quarter than apples results in the year ago period but analysts were also expecting a decline. apple reported revenue and eps of 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00. while these figures were down 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 with apples third quarter in 00NUMBER00 they were both slightly higher than the consensus analyst estimates for these figures. on average analysts were expecting apple to report revenue and eps of about 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 respectively. investors shouldnt mistake apples year over year decline as a struggling business. the companys net income for the quarter amounted to a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion. while this is lower than its record 00NUMBER00 billion third quarter net income last year 00NUMBER00 million more than its 00NUMBER00 billion of net income in the same quarter two years ago. image source apple. one major takeaway from the quarter was the surprising success of apples new lower cost iphone or the iphone se. with a starting price of 00NUMBER00 or about 00NUMBER00 less than the starting price of apples flagship iphone it was unclear whether the smaller iphone would attract many customers. but the iphone se was clearly a hit. launched just before the quarter started it saw demand outstripping supply throughout the entire quarter even as the company added additional capacity apple ceo tim cook explained during the companys third quarter earnings call. cook continued via a reuters transcript  at its launch we said that the addition of the iphone se to the iphone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a 00NUMBER00 inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. in both cases that strategy is working. our initial sales data tells us that the iphone se is popular in both developed and emerging markets and the percentage of iphone se sales going to customers who are new to iphone is greater than weve seen in the first weeks of availability for other iphones launched in the last several years. notably lower average selling prices for iphones driven by robust iphone se sales had a negative impact on the companys gross profit margin during the quarter management said. but management emphasized that the impact was only slight. gross profit margin was 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. this is a relatively modest decrease considering that iphones which represent apples most profitable product segment accounted for 00NUMBER00 of revenue in the year ago quarter and 00NUMBER00 revenue in the third quarter of 00NUMBER00. further apples gross margin for the quarter was at the top of its guidance range 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. clearly therefore any negative impact the iphone se had on margins isnt worth fretting over. the iphone se is proving apple may be able to significantly boost revenue by maintaining this new strategy of introducing less expensive iphones all while having only a minor negative impact on the companys gross profit margin. despite the iphone ses better than expected success in 00NUMBER00 were still ready to ask cook about his thoughts on the iphones potential. after all investors have a right to be somewhat concerned iphone unit sales have been declining on a year over year basis for two quarters in a row falling 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. data for chart retrieved from apple sec filings for quarters shown. chart source author. but cook remains confident in apples iphone businessi see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. i see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. i see the smartphone itself lead by iphone becoming even more instrumental and important to peoples lives. its becoming essential and all of the things that are coming both in the fall. the things that weve announced that you can see with 00NUMBER00 hopefully youre running by now with the beta and other things make it even more instrumental. . . apple again emphasized the growing importance of its services segment which was its second largest segment for a second quarter in a row and increased to represent 00NUMBER00 of sales up significantly from 00NUMBER00 of sales in the year ago quarter. the segments revenue increased by 00NUMBER00 year over year in 00NUMBER00 easily outpacing apples 00NUMBER00 revenue increase in its ipad segment  apples only other product segment that grew during the quarter. and apple was careful to highlight its fiscal 00NUMBER00 introduced non gaap metric   which measures the purchase value of services tied to its growing installed base of devices. apples installed base related purchases increased 00NUMBER00 year over year up from 00NUMBER00 over year growth in 00NUMBER00 and marking the fourth acceleration in growth since the metric was introduced three quarters ago. despite some promising signs for apples business investors shouldnt expect the company to return to growth just yet. management forecast fourth quarter revenue to be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 billion down about 00NUMBER00 from apples 00NUMBER00 of revenue in the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00. however apple could return to growth during its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which begins oct. 00NUMBER00. apples fourth quarter 00NUMBER00 or the current quarter is apples final quarter of year over year comparisons of the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle to the blockbuster iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle so apple was expected to guide for a decline. but investors may begin looking for growth again when apple launches its fall lineup of flagship iphones. overall apples third quarter results marked a company continuing to have difficulty living up to a monster upgrade cycle for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus last year. but the quarter also put a spotlight on evidence suggesting the tech giant can still attract and keep new customers. with iphone se proving to be a good bet and apples services segment looking promising investors can have more confidence apple will soon reverse its declining earnings. meanwhile investors can take comfort in the stocks conservative valuation. the stock simply doesnt require big growth to justify its 00NUMBER00 price to earnings ratio. indeed thanks to apples cheap valuation if apples iphone segment does return to growth in within the next twelve months the stock may turn out to be a steal at this level even after 00NUMBER00 rise. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something

million in revenue. aria shares popped just 00NUMBER00 in response. sales from ariad pharmas iclusig drug a kinase inhibitor for the treatment of adults diagnosed with several chronic forms of leukemia were 00NUMBER00 million. thats more than double    the amount the drug brought in during the year ago quarter. that puts total iclusig sales just under 00NUMBER00 million for the first half of 00NUMBER00. stateside sales of iclusig totaled 00NUMBER00 million a 00NUMBER00 over the 00NUMBER00 million in last years quarter. while in europe iclusig brought in 00NUMBER00 million a more than 00NUMBER00 gain year over 00NUMBER00 stocks to buy if hillary clinton becomes presidenthowever much of that revenue gain was due to a one time charge of the shipping of its iclusig drug to france which padded the top line by 00NUMBER00 million. ariad president and ceo paris panayiotopoulos had this to saywe also strengthened our financial position through our agreement with incyte and the strong sales performance of iclusig. our teams are focused on iclusig growth preparations for the potential launch of brigatinib in the u. s. and driving forward our promising pipeline. and we all know its not just the present that affects a relatively small biotech firm like ariad pharmaceuticals but future pipeline growth. to that end ariad emphasized its plan to expand the market potential of iclusig by treating earlier stages of leukemia. further aria initiated a new drug application for brigatinib which will treat crizotinib resistant patients suffering from alk non small cell lung

of nasdaq inc.  investorplace investorplace  stock market news stock advice trading tipsthis weeks apple inc. nasdaq  aapl    stock chart would make any bull swoon as  apple stock  gapped higher on the heels of its most recent earnings release. in one day shares of aapl stock gained more than 00NUMBER00. that represents the best day for apple stock in almost two years and leaves the stock right around its 00NUMBER00 day moving average. apple stock investors were excited by some better than expected numbers for sales earnings and shipments. and thats nice. but as ive outlined before i have some serious concerns about apple. the earnings release investors are applauding actually highlighted them. perhaps the biggest concern with apple right now is the reality that its staple upgrade cycle is shifting dramatically. this is partially because its becoming increasingly difficult since smartphones have come so far to make major strides on each edition. and this reality was evident in the fact that apples last release was the iphone 00NUMBER00 se basically a smaller iphone 00NUMBER00. in the fiscal third quarter sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 se were better than expected. but thats not the great news it may seem like because this version is also cheaper. put another way it speaks to the fact that innovation is lacking the upgrade cycle has weakened and profit margins are getting squeezed in turn. this was evident in the cold hard numbers which were only applauded because apple managed to hop over a low bar. despite the fact that apple shipped slightly more iphones than expected during the most recent quarter its important note that revenue from iphone sales dipped 00NUMBER00 year over year precisely because of the shift to this lower cost phone. similarly despite the fact that earnings and sales beat expectations both also represented year over year drops. in the most recent quarter apple reported earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share on revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion compared to expectations for 00NUMBER00 per share on sales of 00NUMBER00 billion. but that earnings beat also represented a 00NUMBER00 year over year decline while overall sales 00NUMBER00. ouch. those numbers while often buried behind recent headlines are a reminder that apple is undergoing a huge transition. right now its not even low growth its no growth. facebook inc fb stock is

to bet on cheap low growth stocks with big dividends id rather go with one that isnt as influenced by sentiment and the herd mentality as this publicity driven tech darling … and one thats actually

automotive effort project titan. apple ceo tim cook recently cracked the whip on his companys effort reportedly plagued with infighting and a lack of direction and execution  to disrupt the auto industry. tapping one of the companys most respected leaders apples management hopes project titans new top brass can steer the crucial initiative back into the center lane auto puns very much intended. according to the wall street journal   apple appointed bob mansfield to run project titan. the name probably means little to most apple investors. however die hard apple aficionados will recognize mansfield as the distinguished hardware engineer and project leader who helped create a string of hits for the tech giant including the imac macbook air ipad and apple watch. mansfields presence at the worlds largest company dates back to 00NUMBER00 prior to apples modern renaissance spurred on by the ipod. he was a trusted lieutenant to steve jobs and his surprise retirement announcement is said to have triggered the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 realignment that led to the ouster of the combative but visionary software executive scott forstall. mansfield is a heavy hitter within the apple executive ranks and his assignment to lead special projects which internal sources say means project titan indicates just how seriously apple is taking its automotive initiative. given his track record serving key roles on a number of hugely successful projects its hard not to view mansfields stepping into project titans drivers seat as a positive. however investors should also note that apples success in electric vehicles may hinge on much more than the skills of a single executive. from one perspective apples shadowy efforts to produce its own electric vehicle fit very much within the companys longstanding tradition of disrupting industries through innovation. as many including ceo tim cook have noted the continued digitization of consumers automotive experiences plays to its strengths in software and design. at the same time i find myself increasingly curious as to the exact degree adding apples and now mansfields technology expertise could differentiate project titan from its ranks of ev peers. the electric and autonomous driving car arms races now include seemingly every major consumer tech and automotive company. assuredly though approaches and possible business models may differ every company will emphasize software and infotainment. so in a world where everyone knows the features consumers want from their tech laden future cars will apples car be that much better than everyone elses i havent the slightest idea but it certainly seems a question worth asking. hundreds of apple employees are reportedly working on project titan and it is said to have apples inexhaustible resources at its disposal. at the same time the wsj  report took pains to note that mansfield has killed projects in the past implying project titan is not sacrosanct either. apples gaining a meaningful share of the global automotive market seems like the companys safest bet to achieve meaningful growth atop a revenue base of over 00NUMBER00 billion this year. however with a rumored launch date now pushed back to 00NUMBER00 and enthusiasts will have to endure a considerable wait before this storyline will ever come to fruition. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity

a retirement portfolio. 00NUMBER00 things every retirement investor should ownas we get older our investment objectives change. were less interested in short term trading profits and more interested in stability and income generation. ideally i like to see the following characteristics in place for a retirement stockbusiness should be stable and predictable… or at least as stable and predictable as you can get in a fast changing economy. the company should have a healthy balance sheet with minimal debt. the company should be shareholder friendly with an emphasis on consistently raising its dividend. a portfolio chock full of companies meeting these criteria is one that i could feel comfortable retiring with. the first point about a stable business will be the most controversial for aapl stock given apples status as a technology company. technology is notoriously cutthroat competitive and it wasnt that long ago that aapl was a struggling also ran in the home computer market. then steve jobs brought the ipod and then later the iphone and the rest is history. apple is now the worlds premier smartphone maker with an ever growing empire of consumer and business gadgets. and this is where i believe apple stock makes the grade in a retirement portfolio. while apple inc. no longer churns out new earth changing products every other year its very effective at getting its customers embedded in the apple ecosystem. one you have your photos saved on icloud your music on itunes and untold sums of money spent on apps changing to a rival smartphone platform becomes cost prohibitive. its the hotel california… and you can never leave. so you upgrade your iphone every two years or so and carry on. on the second point balance sheet health aapl stock is really in a class all of its own. apple has the largest cash hoard of any company in history with a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion as of the most recent quarter. to put that in perspective were apples cash in the bank its own company it would be the 00NUMBER00 company in the sp 00NUMBER00 index. just stop and think about that for a minute. yes apples debt load has grown in recent years in part to finance its large stock repurchase program. apple chose to borrow for tax reasons as repatriating the cash from overseas would incur a 00NUMBER00 penalty. but even if apple were to bring the whole lump sum home paying the full tax on the total the company would still have more than enough cash to pay off its entire debt twice over and would still have more cash leftover than it would know what to do with. 00NUMBER00 losers that will be 00NUMBER00 best stocks to buyand finally we get to the third point shareholder friendliness and specifically a long history of dividend hikes. tech companies have historically been stingy with their shareholders and apple was no exception. but starting in 00NUMBER00 started taking its shareholders seriously and initiated a dividend. its been raising it like gangbusters ever since. in less than four years aapl has bumped the dividend by more than half even while reducing its share count by 00NUMBER00 due to buybacks. between the 00NUMBER00 dividend and the roughly 00NUMBER00 buyback yield youre looking at a shareholder yield of about 00NUMBER00. not too shabby. while apple stock may not fit the mold of your typical utility or telecom retirement stock id be willing to be that an apple retirement will be far more lavish. charles sizemore is the principal of sizemore capital a wealth management firm in dallas texas. as of this writing he was long aapl

investorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source getty images. perhaps more than any time in recent memory today is a fascinating time to own or potentially own shares in tech giant apple  nasdaq aapl. the company posted what can easily be interpreted as its worst quarter under ceo tim cook and yet its stock soared 00NUMBER00 in reaction. more meaningfully the outlook for apple and its shares remains unclear as can be seen by one analysts recent call that apple has in his words peaked. borrowing from the energy industry idea of peak oil well known tech analyst colin gillis of bgc financial recently issued a research note that read our opinion is that apple has peaked under the leadership of ceo tim cook. gillis went on to comment our view is that there is risk that the upgrade rate for the next iphone may slow even more than the upgrade rate cycle of 00NUMBER00 which has been materially lower than the upgrade rate of the iphone 00NUMBER00 as per the company. unsurprisingly gillis subsequently downgraded  apple stock  to a sell rating. for good measure he also reduced his 00NUMBER00 month price target for apple stock to 00NUMBER00 a 00NUMBER00 decline from his previous price estimate. this call appears all the more controversial in the wake of the companys better than expected earnings. apples shares on wednesday afternoon are 00NUMBER00 isnt the only counterpoint to gillis doom and gloom apple analysis. the prevailing wisdom for apples annual product refresh cycle is that this years iphone 00NUMBER00 will prove more of a whimper than a bang something of an oddity given apples standing tradition of even year form factor redesigns. if that proves to be the case which isnt certain then gillis expectation of tepid iphone sales in 00NUMBER00 could prove correct. that isnt the end of the story though. image source apple. the rumor mill also claims that the companys lackluster iphone 00NUMBER00 plans foreshadow a far grander plan for apple to release a truly transcendent iphone for fiscal year 00NUMBER00 to commemorate the 00NUMBER00 of the devices launch. at present features like an all glass body edge to edge display lack of home button wireless charging and oled display have all been floated as potential improvements for 00NUMBER00 iphone though as with all rumors they remain far from certain. however as we saw with apples iphone 00NUMBER00 consumers will show up in droves whenever apple is able to truly nail a new smartphone design. this means that apples iphone  super cycle   could be delayed by a year. but apples days of growth arent necessarily behind it either. looking beyond 00NUMBER00 apple enjoys at least one significant identifiable growth driver to debunk gillis peak apple call project titan. as we have known for some time now apple has at least several hundred employees toiling in attempted secrecy on the companys electric vehicle project which some estimates reckon could double apples current revenue. here there are as many questions as answers how will apple maintain its cushy margin structure while moving into a notoriously low margin business how will apple differentiate project titan from the masses of other electric andor self driving vehicles likely to reach the market at roughly the same time these questions barely touch the tip of the iceberg. but judging by the outsized interest in the storyline thus far consumers are open to the idea of apple moving into the space. yes apples growth may slow. to be sure the company has grown so large that it will never enjoy another streak like its post ipod golden age. however to suggest that apple has peaked overlooks the most likely path forward for the tech giant one of low to moderate but lumpy sales growth paired with apples cash hoard fueling continued bottom line growth. apple has grown up but its best days dont seem to be behind it. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

fledgling operation in china. rather than continue to wage a market share war with much bigger ride hailing rival didi chuxing   uber ceo travis kalanick has opted to sell the companys chinese business to didi cutting bait rather than burning more cash to fight a battle it may never win. interestingly and not likely coincidentally the decision to bail out of the chinese effort to date comes in front of a highly rumored uber ipo which may require a great deal of kalanicks focus that would have otherwise been devoted to the companys growth in china. the deal between the rivals values uber china at 00NUMBER00 billion  which when paired with didis 00NUMBER00 million value will establish a new company worth 00NUMBER00 billion. 00NUMBER00 stocks to sell for augustuber will become a 00NUMBER00 stakeholder in the yet to be formed ride finding organization. still its not a bad deal. uber reportedly only invested 00NUMBER00 billion developing its slice of chinas market. the news follows chinas decision to officially  legalize ridesharing for a profit  in that country. while the new allowance favors both companies and others the state government unofficially favors homegrown businesses while making it difficult for foreign companies to set up shop and thrive there. case in point apple inc. nasdaq  aapl    for one. in june the country banned the sale of the iphone 00NUMBER00 until a patent matter has been cleared up. a chinese phone maker claimed that version of the iphone was too much like its product as if other iphones didnt look about the same. earlier in the year chinese regulators shut down apples ibooks and digital movies business with little explanation. three years ago chinas government reportedly paid its celebrities to slam apples technology and policies. perhaps seeing how interested the nations government was and is in propping up chinese businesses over foreign ones in addition to only capturing about a third of that market to date   kalanick opted to not fight a losing battle. still such a deal was never the original plan. earlier this year kalanick claimed uber china would be profitable within two years. although opinions are mixed on the matter most observers think ubers abdication of china is a step in the right direction … particularly of the oft rumored uber ipo is finally come to fruition as is expected soon. while the company has had little trouble securing private funding  almost 00NUMBER00 billion to date   from backers that arent necessarily interested in near term results public funders arent quite as patient. with its presence in china costing uber about 00NUMBER00 billion per year and no solid belief that actual profits were on the horizon a cash burning chinese operation would make for a  disappointing initial public offering in the u. s. triton researchs rett wallace explainedresolution of the land war in asia will be a big comfort to all investors existing and prospective. eliminating the losses is great for the profit and loss statement but more importantly there is now certainty about the end of what was shaping up to be an endless and escalating capital need. nevertheless questions about the viability of ubers business model remain. as of the latest tally based on information about non publicly traded stakes uber is valued at 00NUMBER00 billion. 00NUMBER00 times 00NUMBER00 reported revenue of 00NUMBER00. though profits and losses are tougher to pin down for a privately held company documentation found in the middle of last year indicated uber had lost nearly a billion dollars during the first half of 00NUMBER00 and the loss was getting bigger. uber supporters will be quick to point out you buy stocks not for where the company is but where the company is going. it would take a massive amount of sales growth for the company to even have a shot at actually justifying its current valuation to would be buyers. that may be why kalanick is aiming to hold off on any uber ipo as long as possible     to give the company a chance to create some sort of positive bottom line. in the grand scheme of things getting out of china by selling to didi was the right thing for uber to do whether an ipo is on the near term horizon or not. the company was never going to thrive in china and kalanick has big things to take care of here at home. at the top of the list figuring out how to cost effectively vet its drivers while at the same time protecting them from violent passengers. etsy inc etsy stock holders listen upbe that as it may culling the chinese operation still doesnt inherently make uber a compelling investment for private or public shareholders in the united states. the euphoric buzz can only do so much. at some point results have to do the heavy lifting. as of this writing james brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. 00NUMBER00 things every retirement investor 00NUMBER00 dividend stocks to buy with both

at the results for apple inc. nasdaq  aapl    shrug watch the stock fly and move on. thats what i did to my detriment because i didnt realize the extent to which the iphone sales became the vast majority of aapl revenue. i lost sight of the complete story. now investors must really parse aapl earnings and not take anything for granted. first it should be noted that aapl sold its one billionth iphone. that is an extraordinary achievement and cant be glossed over. selling a million of anything is a challenge but a billion is mind bending. that being said iphone sales did decline both sequentially from 00NUMBER00 million units in 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 million units 00NUMBER00 and from 00NUMBER00 million units in 00NUMBER00 of last year. obviously thats because aapl has not issued a new version of the iphone for some time. as you can see from the chart below thats a highly unusual decline for iphone sales. it isnt that the public doesnt love iphones its just that they love new versions of it more. from an aapl revenue standpoint as a percentage of revenue iphone sales went from 00NUMBER00 last year to 00NUMBER00 this year. one the one hand thats great news because aapl is relying less on the iphone for revenue. on the other hand thats because iphone 00NUMBER00 market predictions for the rest of 00NUMBER00 problem is that sales for ipads and desktops and laptops also fell year over year and combined it resulted in the second consecutive quarter of earnings declines after 00NUMBER00 years of growth. there was some good news here in that the ipad pro stoked ipad sales and the pro has higher margins. there are other troubles. although revenue fell across the board sequentially in all geographic segments and yoy in all segments except japan where it was up 00NUMBER00 china was a disaster. revenue fell 00NUMBER00 sequentially and 00NUMBER00 yoy. there are three remaining points here for investors. first the services segment is starting to grow. thats stuff like app store purchases music subscriptions and icloud storage. revenue on this segment is now just about 00NUMBER00 billion a not insignificant 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. the more aapl can move in this direction perhaps the less dependent it will be on iphone sales. second aapl has always been somewhat of a cyclical business based on its new releases. september should see new iphone releases. third it has become painfully clear at this point that tim cook is no steve jobs. its the difference between having a manager and having a visionary. aapl is no longer a visionary company and thats why were examining the importance of iphone sales and not some amazing new direction for the company. what might be a visionary move aapl has 00NUMBER00 billion in cash. it needs to open a movietv studio with a visionary content creation structure which it could do with 00NUMBER00 billion and have enough to make original content for years. then it could leverage apple tv create its own theatrical distribution arm and give the studios a run for the money. or it needs to make a whole lot of acquisitions that are accretive to net income. until then its probably fairly valued at this point. as of this writing lawrence meyers did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. 00NUMBER00 losers that will be 00NUMBER00 best stocks 00NUMBER00 stocks to buy if hillary

prices of companies they have invested in. for example an apple  nasdaq aapl investor might worry about the risk that competition might finally erode the companys pricing power in the smartphone market. but risk goes both ways. in addition to the downside risks that are frequently discussed there can also be upside risk from unexpected good news. in the case of apple corporate tax reform represents a significant source of upside risk as it could enable the company to take its capital return program to the next level by freeing up offshore cash. corporate tax reform could substantially increase the value of  apple stock. image source the motley fool. in the past five years or so apples cash holdings have swelled to historic proportions. at the end of the companys 00NUMBER00 year it had 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet. but by the end of last quarter it had a 00NUMBER00 billion stockpile of cash and investments. even after deducting its debt obligations apple has a formidable net cash hoard of 00NUMBER00 billion. it doesnt need to keep this much cash around. the only reason it has allowed its cash balance to reach such an absurd level is that most of the cash is officially held outside the u. s. indeed apple recently reported that 00NUMBER00 billion of 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and investments approximately 00NUMBER00 is held by foreign subsidiaries. it would have to pay federal taxes of up to 00NUMBER00 to repatriate that money. instead it has been holding the cash abroad where it earns a pitiful amount of interest income. ceo tim cook has been vocal in advocating for corporate tax reform that would allow apple to bring this cash home at a lower tax rate. he has said that apple would be happy to pay somewhat more than it already does in federal taxes if that would allow it to freely move cash between other countries and the united states. there have been several tax reform proposals  in recent years that would have either permanently lowered repatriation taxes or instituted a one time repatriation tax holiday with a lower rate. unfortunately all of them have died in the midst of congressional gridlock. however the upcoming 00NUMBER00 election could give the winning presidential candidate the political momentum necessary to implement corporate tax reform. donald trump has made a specific proposal to offer a reduced 00NUMBER00 repatriation tax to encourage u. s. companies to bring their cash home. moderate democrats including president obama have also supported a reduced repatriation tax rate recently. this suggests that hillary clinton might introduce similar corporate tax reform legislation if she is elected. if apple were able to repatriate its foreign earnings at a 00NUMBER00 tax rate it would be able to bring home 00NUMBER00 billion after taxes. if the repatriation tax rate were instead 00NUMBER00 apple would still have 00NUMBER00 billion after paying its tax bill. even at the higher 00NUMBER00 rate apple would be able to repatriate enough cash to pay off its entire 00NUMBER00 billion debt burden if it wanted to and have 00NUMBER00 billion left to return to shareholders. that would be enough to buy back about 00NUMBER00 of apples outstanding shares or alternatively to pay a special dividend of about 00NUMBER00 per share. by contrast apple is getting little or no credit for its overseas cash now with shares currently trading for less than 00NUMBER00 forward earnings. corporate tax reform thus represents a significant source of upside risk for apple stock. if apple is allowed to bring all of its overseas cash home while paying a repatriation tax rate 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 it could potentially boost the value of its stock by 00NUMBER00 more. a secret billion dollar

services segment continued growing rapidly. but some of the most interesting tidbits from the quarter arguably came from the companys earnings call not apples quarterly press release. apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. during apples third quarter conference call ceo tim cook shared some key angles on the companys business. here are some of the most interesting takeaways from the call via a reuters  transcript. after pokemon go  inevitably surfaced during apples earnings call cook shared insight into the companys view of augmented reality or a technology that presents a digital image within a users real world view not to be confused with virtual reality. it also does show as you point out that ar can be really great and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. we are high on ar for the long run. we think theres great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity and so were investing. but investors shouldnt jump to the conclusion that apple will soon launch an ar dedicated product. cook went on to emphasize that the no. 00NUMBER00 thing when it comes to investing in ar is to make sure our products work well with other developers kind of products like pokemon. in 00NUMBER00 greater china revenue was down 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter a notable pullback considering the segment accounts for about 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue. but cook explained during the earnings call that this pullback doesnt capture apples performance in the important market. indeed cook says he is very optimistic about the long term opportunities in greater china. apple store in china. image source the motley fool. in china specifically cook said switchers and first time smartphone buyers represented the lions share of our iphone sales in the quarter and our installed base of iphones in china has grown by 00NUMBER00 over the year alone. further cook was quick to bring some bigger picture context to the situationbut to keep things in perspective when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment over the last couple of years they are truly remarkable. in the first three quarters of this fiscal year our total revenue from greater china was 00NUMBER00 billion up 00NUMBER00 from the same time frame just two years ago while iphone units were up 00NUMBER00. apples services segment which includes revenue from internet services applecare apple pay licensing and other services was the companys best performing product segment during 00NUMBER00. revenue was up 00NUMBER00 year over year. this growth easily trumped apples second place product segment ipad which saw 00NUMBER00 revenue growth. all of apples other segments iphone mac and other products reported lower revenue than in the year ago period. with services consistently growing at rapid rates the segment is becoming more important to the tech giants business. cook highlighted some useful perspective on how the segment is representing a larger portion of apples businessbecause of this continued growth for the first nine months of our fiscal year services increased from 00NUMBER00 of our total revenue a year ago to 00NUMBER00 this year. and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability. the key takeaway from this quote is that services represents an even higher percentage of apples profitability. this means that apples services segments reported share of revenue actually understates the segments impact on profits. overall cooks sentiment for apples current situation and the companys future was optimistic. while managements take on augmented reality prospects in china and the importance of its services segment were helpful theres more takeaways that can be gleaned from the call. investors can listen to a

why apple is a unique case when it comes to comparisons and how looking at the companys numbers a little differently paints a much different picture of its current growth. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

click here. this podcast was recorded on july 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewis  why dont we start out talking about apple im a shareholder youre a shareholder a lot of fools are shareholders a lot of people that own mutual funds wind up being shareholders whether they realize it or not because its such a large component of the sp 00NUMBER00. apples top line came in at 00NUMBER00 billion which beat estimates by about 00NUMBER00 million. earnings came in at 00NUMBER00 a share which also beat estimates of 00NUMBER00. i know i was pretty happy to see that because after the last quarterly report i think there was some pessimism following the company in the market. looking at whats going on with their iphone line the company sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones. sell through was 00NUMBER00 that was expected. we knew that was going to be happening with where theyre at in the iphone line and the life cycle there and the product rollouts. asp average selling price for the iphones was 00NUMBER00 is down from what weve seen in the mid 00NUMBER00 of the other lines. overall the category made up about 00NUMBER00 of revenue. we see sell throughs down revenue is down. is this something we should be worried about daniel i think no. what do you think   daniel sparks  this has definitely been a trend for apple 00NUMBER00 watching the company turn to these year over year declines in revenue. i think its something we need to put into perspective of last year. like you said iphone is 00NUMBER00 of revenue so its the key driver here. when iphone sales hurt so does total revenue. and thats been the case. lately iphone sales are down. during this quarter iphone sales were down about 00NUMBER00 which also happens to be in line with the companys year over year decline in revenue. but you have to put that in the context of last year. last year was a monster upgrade cycle for apple. the iphone 00NUMBER00 huge. the holiday quarter which is always apples biggest quarter iphone unit sales were up about 00NUMBER00. that was up from a previous record. and were talking one of the biggest companies in the world. when you have a segment like this posting this sort of growth its not going to be easy to live up to that. so when you zoom out and look at iphone you look at apples business on a two year basis youre actually still seeing revenue headed upward and even net income headed upward. apples third quarter net income of 00NUMBER00 billion was up 00NUMBER00 million from 00NUMBER00 billion two years ago. its still generally a healthy business but we have to put it in comparison to this monstrous year last year. lewis  and you talked about how if you look at things relative to two years ago the numbers actually look pretty rosy. i think thats kind of how you have to look at a business that we expect to issue a major overhaul to their namesake huge product flagship line every two years. the 00NUMBER00 was not a huge incremental change in form factor and they were going up against years where they had rolled out 00NUMBER00 plus line which was a totally different form factor. of course apple ceo tim cook has zero interest in getting into the details on what we can expect for future product launches. but based on the cadence weve seen in the past theyre almost a company you want to see a two or three year comp look at rather than just a straight year over year. i know its tempting for investors but i think its something to be mindful of. daniel sparks  owns shares of apple. dylan lewis  owns shares of apple. the motley fool owns shares of and

next big thing apple  snasdaq aapl ipad has been in a multi quarter slump with revenues continuing to plunge despite the idevice makers best efforts. last quarter apple finally reported a return to growth in ipad revenue as expected. ipad sales rose to 00NUMBER00 billion up from the 00NUMBER00 billion a year ago. units were actually down once again plunging 00NUMBER00 million to just 00NUMBER00 million. the revenue increase implies an increase in ipad average selling prices which ceo tim cook attributed to the release of the relatively pricey 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro during the quarter. is apples ipad business out of the woods or is this just a short term uptick in an otherwise long term declinethe return to modest growth in the quarter was hardly impressive. even with the ramp of a new product the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro the company still  couldnt deliver on a year over year unit increase. the company relied on the introduction of the newer 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro a product more expensive than its immediate predecessor to drive that growth. theres nothing wrong with apple driving revenue growth through average selling price increases increases in average selling prices are often good as they show that customers find increased value in the companys product offerings. the ramp of the new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro clearly provided some stabilization last quarter. its not clear when apple will refresh the rest of its ipad lineup but i wouldnt be surprised to see such refreshes fairly soon in order to keep ipad revenueunits in reasonable shape over the next couple of quarters. over the longer term the future for ipad looks cloudy. with long upgrade cycles and continued competition for share of wallet against the companys own macbook and iphone lineups its difficult to see ipad becoming a business segment that can grow consistently year in and year out. upgrade cycles are seemingly long in the tablet market and it would seem that bringing out new and interesting products year in and year out hasnt helped to offset this fundamental market dynamic. in my view apple should continue on trying to develop compelling products for this segment as it still represents a large if perhaps potentially stagnant revenue opportunity. this way apple can still rake in steady cash flow from ipad sales and if market dynamics change for the better the idevice maker will be well positioned to capitalize on such an opportunity. from an investment perspective its probably best to not count on much in the way of good news for ipad for the foreseeable future. ipad is a relatively small part of the companys overall revenue profile and thats not likely to change. instead it should be monitored as just one part of a much larger iphone dominated business. a secret

stellar desert near the middle of the milky way galaxy which is also called the extreme inner disk is completely devoid of young stars. this was discovered by two groups of scientists using a near infrared telescope. the distance extends roughly 00NUMBER00 light years from the center of the galaxy and its unknown why its like this. a near infrared telescope had to be used in the research due to the lack of visibility around the area. this is due to interstellar dust that can block out light and hide young stars from view. the telescope that was used for the researcher is based in sutherland south africa. scientists did find a few young stars 00NUMBER00 light years of very center of the galaxy but the stellar desert around it not containing any young stars is strange to say the least. some radio astronomers have also reported no new stars being born in this region of the milky way galaxy. the current results indicate that there has been no significant star formation in this large region over hundreds of millions years giuseppe bono an author of the research into the stellar desert said in a statement. the movement and the chemical composition of the new cepheids are helping us

only growing product segment during the quarter which is somewhat surprising just because generally apples ipad segment has been one of its hurting product segments. but recently we know that apple introduced the ipad pro. this looks like its playing a pretty solid role in helping apples ipad business. when we look at the segment we see unit sales down 00NUMBER00 and revenue is up 00NUMBER00. so the only way for this to happen is the average selling price of ipads is trending higher. the ipad pro is definitely a very premium product for apple. it could be said that its cannibalizing mac sales but thats always been part of apples business   innovate as much as possible in each product segment. in that case it looks like its playing a good role in ipad. lewis  yeah. its nice to see asps

highs this morning. but after two years of volatility its still too early to say if pcln has broken out for good. first the good news the online travel booking company posted adjusted second quarter earnings of 00NUMBER00 per share a 00NUMBER00 from the same quarter a year ago and well ahead of consensus analysts expectations of 00NUMBER00 per share. sales also increased 00NUMBER00 year over year though they were a tad shy of wall street estimates. improvements in the global economy certainly helped. online bookings at pricelines three travel websites pricelinecom kayakcom and bookingcom were up a cumulative 00NUMBER00 highlighted by a 00NUMBER00 increase in hotel room bookings. ceo jeff boyd called it a solid start to the summer travel season. 00NUMBER00 no name tech stocks that will make you richinvestors have responded favorably to pricelines strong quarter driving pcln stock up nearly 00NUMBER00 before the opening bell this morning and pushing it above 00NUMBER00 for the first time all year. the stock is now firmly above its 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 day moving averages. so thats the good news. the bad news is that despite the bottom line beat pclns earnings actually grew at their slowest year over year rate since the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 and sales growth actually slowed from the first quarter 00NUMBER00. but thats nitpicking a bit. the real issue that gives me pause with priceline stock has to do with the behavior of the stock itself. pcln has been up and down for two years. every time it appears the stock has finally broken out for good like when it rocketed to 00NUMBER00 last november it comes crashing back down. to wit after that push to 00NUMBER00 in november pcln stock plummeted below 00NUMBER00 over the next two months. a month later it was back up to 00NUMBER00. as recently as late june it was down 00NUMBER00. now its suddenly back above 00NUMBER00. so forgive me if im a bit skeptical of pclns latest move. the kind of wild volatility the stock has demonstrated over the last nine months with a range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 and a beta of 00NUMBER00  makes it hard to have a lot of confidence that pcln can sustain any kind of momentum for longer than a month or two. the cold hard truth is that prior to this mornings post earnings bump pcln stock was trading at almost the exact same share price it was a year ago. thats a trend not a brief lull. its the kind of lackluster trend that makes me think pclns best days late 00NUMBER00 through early 00NUMBER00 when the stock exploded from a mere 00NUMBER00 per share 00NUMBER00 are clearly behind it. back then pricelines sales routinely grew in the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 range even topping 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. the sales growth is still more than respectable but at 00NUMBER00 lacks the same wow factor. companies cant grow the way priceline did during its glorious six year run forever and neither can their stocks. just ask apple inc. nasdaq   aapl. as market penetration expands eventually growth slows and the romance phase on wall street ends. it seems the romance is over for priceline stock however. but that doesnt mean pcln still cant be a solid long term addition to your portfolio. it just needs to prove itself first. if pcln stock continues riding an earnings wave well into next week rivaling its 00NUMBER00 week high then it might finally have some staying power. twtr stock owners dont be so fast to count out steve ballmeruntil that happens id wait to buy pcln stock. seven years removed from the global recession global travel is a good place to be invested. but you dont want to have to wait on a stock if its going to be up and down for another two years. yesterdays earnings beat was a nice start for pcln. now lets see what it does

recovered 00NUMBER00. much of this gain followed the companys better than expected fiscal 00NUMBER00 third quarter earnings report in july. while the stocks rebound may be nice for shareholders some investors who were on the fence about buying shares may feel like theyve missed out. but a closer look at the stock reveals shares still look attractive. image source the motley fool. here are three reasons im still bullish with shares trading under 00NUMBER00. apple stock  isnt priced for growth. in other words apple shareholders can still earn meaningful returns if apples business fails to grow. a basic discounted cash flow valuation of apple stock even a valuation with very  conservative assumptions built into the model easily illustrates this point. for instance a discounted cash flow valuation projecting apples trailing 00NUMBER00 month free cash flow will increase by just 00NUMBER00 or about in line with the historical rate of inflation pegs the present value of apples future free cash flows at 00NUMBER00 per share when using a 00NUMBER00 discount rate to account for the time value of money and the risk associated with investing in stocks. and what really makes this valuation conservative is that it leaves apples excess cash totally out of the equation. so based on the underwhelming projection that apple can only boost free cash flow by about 00NUMBER00 annually over the long haul shares are trading at approximately a 00NUMBER00 discount to fair value today leaving a meaningful margin of safety for investors who buy at 00NUMBER00. worries are overblown. the main concern in the media today about apples business is the companys declining iphone sales in recent quarters. the problem was official in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 with iphone revenue up just 00NUMBER00 it was clear the year of apples iphone 00NUMBER00 likely fail to live up to the iphone 00NUMBER00 precedence. and this is exactly what proceeded to happen. 00NUMBER00 iphone revenue was down 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 was down 00NUMBER00. ouch. rightits not as bad as it looks at least not to investors willing to zoom out and look at the bigger picture. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. iphone sales in the year of apples flagship iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle arent weak by any means. theyre just coming up shy of the companys year ago blockbuster iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. during this year iphone sales skyrocketed with year over year growth between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 in each quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. this makes for very  tough comparisons in 00NUMBER00. and heres another way to look at it. zooming out two years provides a different perspective apples iphone sales in 00NUMBER00 are up 00NUMBER00 from the same quarter two years ago. 00NUMBER00. apples brand can carry over to new segments. theres an enormous benefit to apples relentless focus on the consumer experience. the company can enter new segments with clout that even established industry incumbents can only dream about. for instance apple successfully entered and subsequently dominated both the 00NUMBER00 and cellphone market with its ipod and iphone. as the company grows apple could bring the same brand and pricing power to other segments such as the nascent wearables segment and autos. when viewing apples excellent track record in combination with its cheap valuation apple stock still looks like a steal under 00NUMBER00. sure there may be some volatility ahead but investors willing to hold for five or more years will likely look back and be happy they bought a slice of this incredible brand. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

ramp up as september approaches. thats the time when apple typically updates its mobile devices and when its expected to release new versions of its apple watch as well. yes i said versions  within an s. according to a new investor note sent out by kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo apple will unveil two new versions of its apple watch this year. kuo has a pretty solid track record for apple predictions so you can take these rumors a little more seriously than many of the others that tend to pop up around apple devices. in his note kuo said that the first new version of the apple watch 00NUMBER00 will have gps capability and a barometer sensor both of which are absent in the current version of the apple watch. this version will also sport a larger battery improved water proofing a thinner display though the device thickness will remain the same and include a faster 00NUMBER00 nanometer processor. if true the addition of gps and a barometer would be significant upgrades over the current apple watch. a faster processor is also welcome. but notably missing is a redesign of the device that debuted nearly two years ago. perhaps apple will give its wearable tech longer design cycles than it does its iphones which it redesigns every two years or maybe kuo is wrong and well actually see an apple watch redesign this year. anythings possible at this point. the second version of the apple watch kuo mentioned will essentially be a slightly enhanced version of apples current smartwatch. dont expect gps or a barometer in this one but do expect some level of increased water proofing and a 00NUMBER00 nanometer processor as well. also kuo expects some sort of price cut for the device though its still unclear how. apple might cut the existing apple watch price again or it could sell the slightly improved apple watch 00NUMBER00 at a lower price. either way it sounds like consumers will be able to get their hands on an apple watch for at least a little bit cheaper than the current 00NUMBER00 price tag. at face value im a bit skeptical that these changes will convince consumers who are currently sitting on their wallets to open them up. heres whyapple is the no. 00NUMBER00 selling smartwatch right now but sales have fallen 00NUMBER00 since its initial launch according to idc. worldwide smartwatch shipments are down 00NUMBER00 year over year for the first time ever. that could be because people are waiting for the apple watch 00NUMBER00 to come out or it could mean that almost everyone who wants an apple watch already has one. apple is always pushing thinner and lighter iphones to prospective buyers every two years and i think consumers might push back if apple isnt providing the same thing for its apple watch which is already a bit too thick. some rumors do suggest the new apple watch could be up to 00NUMBER00 thinner. if so then i think apple has a much better chance at getting its smartwatches to fly off the shelves again. additionally kuo doesnt say that either apple watch 00NUMBER00 will have its own cellular connection. which means of course that the device will still be dependent on the iphone. i think that might keep consumers away from the device as well as they wait for the next  upgrade. were still at the beginning stages of the smartwatch market so theres not really any past consumer sentiment we can go on for what people expect out of new smartwatches and how often those changes should come. it appears apple as usual is taking the conservative route and issuing incremental changes at this point. apple has the ability to take it slow right now as its nearest smartwatch rival samsung   shipped 00NUMBER00 million fewer smartwatches in the most recent quarter. but i think this slow pace if true could also backfire if apple doesnt offer enough new hardware features. smartwatches still arent a must have product for most people and adding gps and a barometer without a full redesign might not be enough to fix that. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  weve seen quite a few philosophical debates in this advisor forum recently and an article published on todays sa brings up a not so commonly addressed point that may resolve some of this tension. i am referring to sa contributor vishal khandelwals interview with india based fund manager rajeev thakkar. it is one of the great benefits of seeking alpha that our site offers wide exposure to ideas including those more apt to be covered in the dalal street investment journalthan in the wall street journal and it behooves serious value investors to learn from mr. thakkar an acolyte of benjamin graham and warren buffett. but for our purposes here i was intrigued by his views on the advisor client relationship to witthe first key thing if youre managing other peoples money is to get the right kind of investors. if there is a mismatch between what you can deliver and what your clients expectations are then you are headed for trouble from day one. although we run an open ended mutual fund from day one we have been communicating that if your investment horizon is less than 00NUMBER00 years then this is not the place for you. numerous points emerge from this pithy statement. for one thing some diy readers reacted skeptically to advisors posting comments in this forum about the importance of investor education. but thakkars experience attests to the value of clients being on board with the advisors philosophy. that implies that a an advisor must have a clearly defined method and b if the client doesnt already subscribe to that same philosophy the advisor who in this case possesses superior investment knowledge must educate the client or the relationship is not likely to last. i know of one advisor who proudly relayed to me a few years ago that not one of his clients begged for mercy during the market crisis of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 specifically because he put a tremendous emphasis on educating clients on the value of a long term globally diversified equity heavy portfolio and they believed him. and to date have been rewarded for their faith in their advisor. a second implication of thakkars point is the simple reality that investors are a jittery bunch. and therefore an incompatibility between advisor and client will express itself in investor flight. especially in todays age with such high divorce rates maritally and commercially few are those seeking to make the relationship work. a robust market covers many sins but when the market tanks as it eventually will look for many of these relationships to break up if not based on a broader philosophical compatibility. a third implication of thakkars statement is that there is a quantitative aspect to advisor client matching that is based on investment horizon. i think that point is key. it may not be effective for the advisor to tell the client to hold stocks for the long run. thakkar is putting a number on it essentially saying you dont need a quarterly statement twice a decade will serve you better. so investor education groundedness and a clearly defined time frame would appear to be critical elements of the advisor investor relationship. do you think these items will preserve the relationship or is there more we should be looking at to ensure we have a match please share your thoughts in the comments section. and speaking of advisor client matches sa contributor david pinsen who works with advisors and other investors through his portfolio armor hedging program has asked if there is an advisor using his app in the fort wayne ind. area whom he might match with an investor client there. apple aapl doesnt identify the geography of his apps users. please get in touchhere are todays advisor related

just 00NUMBER00 years ago would be worth more 00NUMBER00 today. since apple went public in 00NUMBER00 shares have split four times. in june of 00NUMBER00 apple stock was split 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. whether it was on purpose or not the split changed apple stocks pre split all time high from a few dollars above 00NUMBER00 to about 00NUMBER00 after accounting for the split. apples initial public offering price was 00NUMBER00. adjusted for splits however the ipo price is 00NUMBER00. generally stock splits are purposed to make shares easier to buy for individual investors. this was particularly the case with apple during its last split as shares went from trading 00NUMBER00 to under 00NUMBER00. in a 00NUMBER00 earnings call apple ceo tim cook specifically said that the company was splitting its shares to make them more accessible to a larger group of investors. in the end however splitting a stock does nothing for the overall value of a business. this really depends on how shares perform in the future but its unlikely to happen anytime soon. given that when apple split its shares last it didnt do it until the stock hit an all time high of 00NUMBER00 a stock split is probably the last thing on the boards mind with shares currently trading at just 00NUMBER00. apples stock splits over the years are a testament to its market crushing return. without these splits

a notable purchase because the two companies have been in a bitter and expensive pricing war in the country for the past few years. didi was already winning most of the battles while uber was spending 00NUMBER00 billion in two years just to keep up. the deal is essentially the best of both worlds for both companies. in exchange for uber chinas brand business and all of its data didi is investing 00NUMBER00 billion in ubers global business and uber gains a 00NUMBER00 stake in didi. the two companies will also share board seats with each with didis founder and ceo cheng wei joining ubers board and uber ceo travis kalanick going to didis. didi chuxing already delivers 00NUMBER00 million rides every single day in china and says it has 00NUMBER00 of the ride hailing market. thats now closer to 00NUMBER00. didis presence is in more than 00NUMBER00 cities across china and received a 00NUMBER00 billion investment from apple  back in may as well as a slew of other investments  that put didis valuation at 00NUMBER00 billion. but the uber deal pushes up the companys valuation to 00NUMBER00 billion. thats impressive but still far short of ubers 00NUMBER00 billion. ubers biggest gain in the deal is probably in the fact that its now much freer to pursue an ipo. the companys investors reportedly wanted uber to get out of china before the company went public because the uber was spending so much money in the country. didi not only gains uber chinas business in the deal but it also eliminates a key competitor in the county. now didi is free to dominate the space as it sees fit. but it also gives didi a stake in yet another ride hailing company. didi has already partnered with ola the largest ride hailing service in india and grab the largest in southeast asia as well as lyft the second largest in the u. s. apparently lyft is getting cold feet about its current partnership with didi after the uber deal and has said its reevaluating its relationship with didi. before lyft users could use their app to hail didi rides while traveling in china and vice versa. lyft never entered china saying that it realized there were too many policy changes and regulations in the country. so didi has essentially won the ride hailing war in china and uber walks away with a large stake in didi and a significant investment. meanwhile dark clouds appear to be forming over lyft. itll be interesting to see how didi expands once the deal is completed it still needs to pass regulatory approval. china is the largest automotive market in the world and the ride hailing segment is still at the beginning stages. the better didi performs in china the better uber will now do in china as well. and with a possible ipo on the horizon thats far more than uber could have ever asked for. a

has been demand for the iphone   especially when this is expected to be the first non s year without a major upgrade. analysts have long been trying to reassure investors about the iphone 00NUMBER00 will do ok and possibly even bring a return to growth. now one analyst has bumped up his price target for his increased outlook for the iphone 00NUMBER00 but not for the reason you think. rbc capital markets llc  analyst amit daryanani bumped his target for apple stock  up from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share after increasing his estimate for iphone units in the december quarter. he adjusted his target price because he expects the company to sell more iphones in the quarter than he was previously expecting. however its not because he suddenly expects the iphone 00NUMBER00 to do much better than what most of wall street expects. its because he has learned that apples first fiscal quarter the december quarter has an extra week than usual. he noted that usually apples december quarter has 00NUMBER00 weeks but explains that this year the quarter will have 00NUMBER00 weeks instead. daryanani expects the extra week to bring in sales of an 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million iphone units and make it easier for the company to see a return to unit growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00. as a result he now pegs the number of iphone units for the december quarter at about 00NUMBER00 million units which is about a 00NUMBER00 increase from last year. his estimate is now higher than the consensus 00NUMBER00 million units. he expects december quarter revenues to come in at 00NUMBER00 billion well ahead of the consensus of 00NUMBER00 billion. his earnings per share estimate for the quarter is 00NUMBER00 compared to the consensus of 00NUMBER00 per share. 00NUMBER00 tech stocks that will pop 00NUMBER00 or morehe noted that having one extra week is only a transient positive impact and actually will make the quarter over quarter decline between december and march look worse than usual. however he sees the extra week as making his model look more attractive with year over year growth for iphone units returning for the first time in the december quarter. additionally he said the extra week should add between 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 basis points of incremental growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00 looking at a year over year basis. daryanani believes  apple stock  will keep moving higher for the foreseeable future because the company does face easier year over year comparisons. additionally the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch is expected next month and there are signs that the companys gross margins are stabilizing or possibly improving. thursday apple rumors gold iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 images leakdaryanani also noted that sentiment on apple stock has improved in the wake of the iphone makers june beat and raise quarter. he said investors are becoming more comfortable that the companys story is intact especially in terms of gross margins and channel inventory. he added that channel inventory dynamics from the june quarter should have alleviated concerns about iphone units average selling prices  and gross margins for the second half of the year. shares of

revenue were down 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. this was an extension of a similar quarter of declines for the segment in the prior quarter. apple investors are still getting used to this new dilemma as iphones sales didnt start to decline until this year. unfortunately 00NUMBER00 will likely deliver more of the same. heres what to expect from apples iphone segment this quarter. apple doesnt provide a forecast for quarterly iphone sales so the best way to get an idea of what management might expect from the segment is to look at managements guidance for total revenue. because iphone sales represent about 00NUMBER00 of revenue the trajectory of iphone sales during a quarter strongly drives the trajectory of apples total revenue so their trajectories should be similar. for 00NUMBER00 apple guided for revenue between 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion representing a 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 decline compared to apples revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion in the year ago quarter. if iphone revenue follows a similar trajectory 00NUMBER00 iphone revenue will be somewhere around 00NUMBER00 billion down from 00NUMBER00 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00. where would this put iphone unit sales taking into consideration the fact that iphone revenue will likely decline at a slightly steeper rate than iphone units because apples lower cost iphone se   which was introduced in march is driving average selling prices lower the trajectory of apples guidance suggests that iphone unit sales will likely be somewhere around a range 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million units. this is down from 00NUMBER00 million units in the fourth fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. notably if apples guidance for total revenue does reflect the companys expected trajectory for iphone revenue during the quarter 00NUMBER00 would mark a moderation to apples trend of declining iphone revenue compared to the previous two quarters. however even if apple expects a smaller year over year decline in iphone sales in 00NUMBER00 this may not be indicative of improving comparisons for the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. another potential explanation for a smaller expected decline during the quarter could simply be an earlier launch for its flagship iphone which usually launches toward the end of the tech giants fiscal fourth quarter. image source apple. industry blogger evan blass which appleinsider asserts  has a solid track record speculating about upcoming smartphone releases said on twitter that iphones will be available in stores and ship to customers on friday september 00NUMBER00 giving apples new flagship phone about one extra week in the quarter to sell. in 00NUMBER00 for instance it wasnt until september 00NUMBER00 that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus began shipping to customers. an extra week for apples newest iphone to ship to customers during the companys fiscal fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 could give iphone sales during the quarter a significant boost. if blass is right about apple planning for an early iphone launch its worth wondering just how steep the year over year decline in the companys guidance for 00NUMBER00 would have been without the help of an extra week of sales of the upcoming flagship iphone. looking beyond fiscal 00NUMBER00 fourth quarter apples guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 will likely be even more interesting as it will help investors get an idea of whether the tech giant expects iphone sales to continue to decline even after it launches its newest smartphone. a secret

iphone proves to be an extremely compelling product. one area in which i expect the next iphone which ill refer to as iphone 00NUMBER00 to be substantially improved relative to its predecessor is the display. apple has historically done major display upgrades in its iphone lineup every two product generations so its about time for an iphone display upgrade. earlier this year i outlined  three major display upgrades that i expect to see in iphone 00NUMBER00 a true tone display that varies color temperature based on ambient lighting a panel with support for a greater color saturation that is a wider color gamut and an anti reflective coating. although the next iphone could feature the first two items theres some evidence to suggest that the third isnt likely to happen this year. several photos purportedly of the next generation iphone have hit the web over the past month or so. heres one thats supposed to be of the next generation iphone 00NUMBER00 plusimage source kkj. cn via my drivers. notice that the front of the device is heavily reflecting its surroundings. if the device shown in the image represents what the final version of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will be then i think that we can forget about having apple bring the anti reflective coating that it uses on its ipad pro lineup to the iphone this year. an anti reflective coating particularly the one found on the current generation ipad pro would have been a very nice addition to the next generation iphone. as a user of both an iphone 00NUMBER00 and a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro i really appreciate the anti reflective coating found on the ipad and wish it were on my iphone. apple clearly has the technology to implement this feature  if it can be implemented on a large 00NUMBER00 inch screen then it can be implemented on smaller 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch screens. so why would the company potentially leave it off of the next generation iphonei believe it ultimately comes down to economics. adding this coating probably leads to a modest increase in the bill of materials cost of the phone relative to leaving it off. additionally adding the coating might lead to decreased manufacturing yields. if the coating isnt applied properly the front panel of the phone could need to be scrapped. at this point given that the company really needs to put the iphone back on a growth path it might be a good idea to sacrifice gross profit margin a bit by adding in features that could help drive upgrade activity andor share gains at the high end of the smartphone. however i suspect that apple is still trying to be very  careful about what features it adds in particularly if those features bring non trivial increases in costs. sacrificing margin for features is fine if those features drive additional sales but if the odds arent high that they will drive incremental sales or share gains then thats just an unnecessary destruction of shareholder value. the ipad pro on the other hand doesnt ship in anywhere near the volumes a flagship iphone does. additionally ipad sales as a whole dont make up anywhere close to the percentage of apples top and bottom lines that iphone does. this gives apple a bit more freedom to add features to the ipad relative to the iphone. apples new iphone is expected to be announced on sept. 00NUMBER00 to bloomberg so it wont be long until we know whether the new iphone has an anti reflective coating. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

life is rarely that simple. all value managers are not alike nor are all growth managers. importantly the distinctions are complicated by a lack of standardization. for example the following table shows how style index firms currently disagree on three popular stocksclick to enlargegood chance youve picked the style you agree with but do you know why apple aapl is not a growth stock if you use its current priceearnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 but it is growth if you use its 00NUMBER00 times pricebook. choosing your style provideras you can see style providers can disagree so how can you decide which one you like you could start by learning their rules by visiting these websitessprussellsurzill spare you some time and pain by summarizing the key classification variables used by these firmsclick to enlargeso it really boils down to a choice between pricebook and priceearnings. the rationale for pricebook is that a stock trading at a price near or below its cost basis is inexpensive a good value. but as laurence siegel clarifies in a cfa research foundation monograph book value is mostly ahistorical accident. it is the accounting professions estimate of the companys value it reflects what the company paid for assets. siegel calls book value a stock variable in contrast to earnings which are a flow variable. earnings are about today whereas book value is history. serious distortionscan be caused by the use of book value. during the financial crisis in 00NUMBER00 the prices of distressed banks fell while their book values remained unchanged so these very risky stocks became deep value by the russell and sp pricebook definition. by contrast these very same banks were classified as aggressive growth by the surz definition because their earnings plummeted much faster

more apple  nasdaq aapl stock according to a sec filing. apparently berkshires 00NUMBER00 billion position in the tech giant the company initiated earlier  this year wasnt enough. with berkshire hathaway upping its stake in apple should individual investors do the samewarren buffett. image source the motley fool. during 00NUMBER00 berkshire hathaway increased its stake in apple 00NUMBER00 million shares or 00NUMBER00. this brings the companys total apple shares to 00NUMBER00 million. at the end of berkshires second quarter these shares were worth 00NUMBER00 billion. shares are worth closer to 00NUMBER00 billion as of tuesday thanks to the stocks 00NUMBER00 since the end of june driven largely by the companys better than expected second quarter earnings report. after another significant purchase of  apple stock  during 00NUMBER00 the tech giant is becoming one of berkshires largest equity holdings. berkshire has only 00NUMBER00 equity positions in publicly traded stocks worth more than its apple stake. notably berkshires apple position is now worth more than its stake in general motors   which is valued at about 00NUMBER00 billion at the time of this writing. berkshire first started buying apple stock in the first quarter of 00NUMBER00. so this makes two quarters in a row of apple stock purchases for the company. investors should note that berkshires move to buy more apple stock during the second quarter likely wasnt buffetts decision. as part of the companys plan to prepare berkshire for an inevitable future without the famed investor buffett has brought on hedge fund managers todd combs and ted weschler to begin managing some of the companys money. buffett has said most of the investments made with 00NUMBER00 billion or less are likely investments by the two new investment managers. and this was the case with the companys apple investment buffett specifically confirmed with the wall street journal  in may that berkshires nearly 00NUMBER00 billion investment in apple stock in 00NUMBER00 was made by one of his lieutenants. with the companys initial position in apple stock started by one of buffetts lieutenants and not the oracle of omaha himself the second quarter investment was likely made by the same former hedge fund manager. while an investment decision made by buffett himself could carry more weight for investors than one made by one of his lieutenants its still notable to see berkshire upping its stake in the tech giant. though buffetts lieutenants may sometimes have different opinions than the ceo they still share common investment principles namely a commitment to buying undervalued businesses with the intention of holding for very long periods of time usually decades. further berkshires two quarters in a row of significant purchases of apple stock suggest the company has a high level of confidence in the investment. apple store. image source apple. its easy to see why berkshire likes apple stock. with a price to earnings ratio of under 00NUMBER00 the stocks valuation is wildly conservative. apples powerful brand long history of excellent capital stewardship and undeniable pricing power easily justify this valuation. in this case imitating berkshires apple investment seems to make sense. sure berkshire may have not yet made a name for itself when it comes to tech investments and buffett himself may not have made this investment decision but apple stock already looked like a no brainer investment opportunity on its own. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest

company on july 00NUMBER00. the stock has gained nearly 00NUMBER00 since then rising from 00NUMBER00 per share to nearly 00NUMBER00 as of the time of this writing. in terms of market capitalization this means that apple has added approximately 00NUMBER00 billion to its market value after reporting earnings. this impressive performance over a relatively short period of time cannot be attributed to one single factor. however apple ceo tim cook said in the post earnings conference call that demand for the iphone se outperformed expectations and the device is particularly successful at attracting new customers to the apple ecosystem. this is clearly good news for investors in apple and arguably one of the main reasons the stock is doing so well. apple launched its iphone se model in march and the 00NUMBER00 inch device is considerably cheaper than previous iphone models. the iphone se has a starting price of 00NUMBER00 without a two year contract. as a reference the iphone 00NUMBER00 starts at 00NUMBER00. apple devices are typically much more expensive than products from the competition and this can be a major disadvantage for the company in competitive terms. this is especially relevant in emerging markets where income levels are much lower than in the u. s. and the carrier subsidy business model is not as prevelantthe iphone se substantially reduces apples pricing disadvantage in smartphones so it could be a powerful move to attract new customers to the apple ecosystem. in fact thats one of the main reasons apple launched the product in the first place. according to tim cook demand for the iphone se exceeded supply during the june quarter. the company managed to balance demand and supply in september and this bodes well in terms of sales going forward. importantly the iphone se is bringing in plenty of new customers to apple when it comes to both first time smartphone buyers and switchers from other platforms. cook provided a lot of detail on the launch of the iphone sewe had a very successful global launch of iphone se and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. we brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply demand balance as we entered the september quarter. at its launch we said that the addition of the iphone se to the iphone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a four inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. in both cases that strategy is working. our initial sales data tells us that the iphone se is popular in both developed and emerging markets and the percentage of iphone se sales going to customers who are new to iphone is greater than weve seen in the first weeks of availability for other iphones launched in the last several years. overall we added millions of first time smartphone buyers in the june quarter and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iphone sales weve ever measured. in absolute terms our year to date iphone sales to switchers are the greatest weve seen in any nine month period and our active installed base of iphones is up strong double digits year over year. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was an extraordinary success for apple in 00NUMBER00. many customers were eagerly awaiting a iphone model with a larger screen size and the iphone 00NUMBER00 was a game changer in that area. during fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple sold over 00NUMBER00 million iphones an impressive increase of 00NUMBER00 versus fiscal 00NUMBER00. most customers dont upgrade their iphones every year so massive sales in 00NUMBER00 represent quite a challenge for apple 00NUMBER00. to put the numbers in perspective the company sold 00NUMBER00 iphone units in the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 which is a 00NUMBER00 increase versus the same period in 00NUMBER00 but still down by 00NUMBER00 versus the third quarter in fiscal 00NUMBER00. data source sec filings. the fact that the iphone se is attracting new customers to the apple ecosystem shows that apple can gain ground versus lower priced competitors reducing the companys dependency on renewal sales. besides apple users are typically very loyal to the brand so chances are that a considerable share of these new iphone buyers will continue being apple customers in the future. in a nutshell the iphone se is not only selling better than expected but its also attracting lots of new customers to apples famously sticky ecosystem of products services and applications. this has strong positive implications for investors in apple going forward. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

a social network for investors. it’s also a trading platform. and it offers up news fundamentals charts and sentiment. plus it allows traders and investors to monetize their knowledge and skills. such an offering is unusual for a company that’s barely over a year old raising the question “who’s behind all this”benzinga spoke with the man responsible peeptrade founder and ceo juan mendoza to learn exactly how he’s done it. benzinga what is peeptrade how does it workjuan mendoza we think of peeptrade as a one stop shop for financial information and investing. it’s also a real social network for the retail investor and trader. social trading links traders from all over the world. they can interact with each other and they can actually trade on the platform. investors can list their portfolio on peeptrade share that knowledge with someone else and if they want monetize that knowledge. can you share a little about your backgroundsure. first of all i’m an engineer. i started working for jp morgan in mexico for five years in market risk credit risk and liquidity risk. at that time i finished my mba at the university of texas. then i started working at bbva the largest financial institution in mexico. i was project manager in charge of all their structured products. i am also an investor. i have always been a fan of the financial markets. juan mendozahow did the idea for peeptrade come aboutwe started developing the product a little over 00NUMBER00 months ago. it began one day while talking to a friend. we came up with the idea of creating a social network for investors. the idea was to allow users to monetize their own knowledge. we saw a good opportunity raised some money and founded the company in austin texas. later we moved to chicago where we have been for six months. we are a work in progress and spend a lot of time developing the things our users request. we want to be the most complete social information financial platform on the market and i think we are accomplishing that. what’s an investor and what is a “peeper”investors are all those who have uploaded their portfolios. peepers are those who have not uploaded a portfolio but just want to see – or “peep” at the portfolios and investments of successful investors and traders. we just integrated with – pretty much – all the brokers in the u. s. when you upload your portfolio we provide real time updates and news to help you invest. in addition you have the ability to “peep” at other investors and see what they are doing. are there qualifications investors have to meet or can anyone be an investoranyone can upload their portfolio. peepers and other investors can give star ratings or post a review on an investor’s profile. we also make sure there is performance information like return versus standard poor’s track record and other metrics. how much do investors charge others to “peep”we leave that up to the investor. we have everything from 00NUMBER00 to an ira that charges 00NUMBER00. it’s up to them. we don’t suggest. we want to be a marketplace where supply meets the demand. i would say the average charge is probably around 00NUMBER00 per month. what do you get specifically when you pay an investor to see their tradesseveral things. first you have access to the investor’s actual portfolio. this is not paper trading. this is real money. peepers receive notifications about trades – securities bought or sold. you can also interact with the investor. actually you can interact with everyone on the site but when you pay you have access to premium content. some investors post their trades publicly. others post only to their peepers. can you give a real world example of how trading on the platform workssure. we have an api that integrates us with the largest brokers. let’s say you see an investor trading apple aapl. you click on apple and you see all the data including what people are talking about what analysts recommend and so forth. you say “i think it’s a good call to buy apple right now. ”so you then click there and place your order through third party integration. you put in your broker’s credentials and the trade is executed. you don’t have to go into your broker’s website or software. you mention data that you get. what kind of information is available to investors on peeptradelet’s say you bought apple and you have your portfolio uploaded and linked with peeptrade. every time there’s a news release you’ll get a notification. every time the stock moves up or down over a certain threshold you’ll receive a notification. if it is a trending stock you’ll receive a notification. this is much more complex than a watch list. it is actual information. the idea is to keep users informed about their holdings. what are some enhancements that have taken place on the peeptrade platformwhen we started we were integrated with just one broker. now we are integrated with virtually all brokers. that’s a big improvement. another enhancement is the improvement in the quality of the news we get. our users are getting news from more sources and more reliable sources. the integration that allows you to trade from the platform is another. the notifications especially with regard to news is another major improvement. what about the futureour goal is to be the one place you go to when you want to trade or invest. we don’t want to be a brokerage but we want to be in the middle of all the brokers. we want to concentrate all the information in one place. we believe social trading will become very important and we want to be part of it. this article is exclusive to nasdaqcom. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source the motley fool flickr. applenasdaq aapl is running low on street cred and rocket fuel. does the consumer electronics giant have another run left in the tanksure apple is still the largest company in the world by market cap. but the former hypergrowth darling has hit a brick wall leaving investors frustrated. apple shares are stuck at prices it first reached in november 00NUMBER00. if you bought the stock at the wrong moment in 00NUMBER00 you might have as little as a 00NUMBER00 gain to show for your patience. in both cases apple has trailed far behind the sp 00NUMBER00 market barometer. at the same time both the iphoneand ipadlines seem to have peaked with sales for both tracking lower year over year. this is of course the chief cause for those disappointing stock returns. iphones account for more than half of apples quarterly revenue after all slower sales in that crucial department hurts both the company and its investors. youll find investing legends on both sides of the apple conundrum right now. according to regulatory filings warren buffetts berkshire hathawayrecently upped its apple holdings by a massive 00NUMBER00. but george soros exited his entire apple stake in the second quarter david einhorns greenlight capital reduced its apple bet by 00NUMBER00 and michael burrys scion asset management mirrored soros move. none of these investing titans have explained their moves in public but buffett is betting that apple can bounce back while the others appear to have soured on the companys risk reward ratio. its rarely wise to bet against warren buffett but i think the oracle of omaha is playing the wrong side here. apple has been dead money for two years and is in dire need of an inspiring product launch. the next iphone model is apparently arriving in late september and could indeed give apple the kick start it wants. but last years iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus models failed to light a growth fire under the company despite introducing some interesting new features. early rumors and leaks for the upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 havent shown anything more exciting than a new stereo speaker setup and the lackof a 00NUMBER00 mm headphone jack. i just dont see how this model could get apple back to serious sales growth. image source apple. likewise ipads have not introduced a whole lot of innovation in recent years. apple fans are even growing restless about the aging macbook pro line of laptops which was last updated in 00NUMBER00. yes apple has a lot of cash and the pile is still growing. the company can afford to sit on its hands for quite a while resting on its laurels until the next world beater product comes along. meanwhile investors must guess whats really going on inside the infamously tight lipped company. is there an apple branded tv set under development has cupertino designed its own car or at least a self driving tool package for traditional car makers to use will the company make a big bet on the internet of things. . . or none of the abovelook i dont think that apple would be a good short at this point. the cash pile alone is enough to keep the company alive and relevant for many years to come and the stock is unlikely to dive off a steep cliff. but its equally unlikely to move up to any significant degree unless ceo tim cook has some real magic up his sleeve. the worlds largest and richest company really should be able to pull a nice rabbit out of the hat once in a while and it could happen at any time. still it would surprise me. the company doesnt seem interested in doing anything radically new and you dont win big without taking the occasional risk. so ill stay on the sidelines next to george soros and david einhorn. apples mojo is probably not coming back anytime soon. a secret billion dollar

that ceo tim cook has said revenue from services will be the size of fortune 00NUMBER00 company next year shareholders may be seriously undervaluing this portion of the company. after the companys most recent earnings services revenue grew 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 billion and in the last 00NUMBER00 months its generated more than 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue for the company. thats an enormous amount of revenue more than what yahoo box salesforce generate in a quarter combined. as apples active installed based of devices continues to grow its now more than 00NUMBER00 billion services revenue led by things like apple music itunes icloud the app store apple care and others will continue to grow. its important to keep this in mind as the iphone continues to plod along growing not as sharply as it did a couple of years ago. if rumors and speculation wind up being true about what the iphone 00NUMBER00 will feature apple shareholders can expect another slow year of iphone revenue and unit growth but services will continue to move along just nicely. this is a valuable source of revenue especially when you factor in that ios users spend two and half times more on things like in app purchases than android users im guilty of spending quite a few dollars myself. after listening to apple execs in particular eddy cue talk about apples media and content plans its clear that apple music in particular will be a growth driver for the services business especially as it adds video content. with more than 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers and counting apple music is poised to be the content hub for apple going forward helping drive the services business. with the release of more innovative iphones the 00NUMBER00 year anniversary iphone is rumored to be a must have the return to growth albeit revenue if not units for the ipad and the mac continuing to perform well apples services business not its hardware business is likely to cause a re rating of shares considerably higher than they are today for patient shareholders. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq

inc.  whether you understand it or not or like elon musk you even fear it artificial intelligence promises to become one of the most important areas of technology in coming years. image source getty images. though certainly far from creating anything bordering on skynet tech giants including alphabet microsoft facebook amazon and many others have plowed headlong into the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. following suit tech giant applenasdaq aapl  recently demonstrated its own interest in the space by acquiring ai start up turi for a reported 00NUMBER00 million. lets see why. as a number of major publications have noted apple purportedly purchased the seattle based turi in early august for an alleged but unconfirmed 00NUMBER00 million. when asked about the buyout apple predictably responded with the same boilerplate statement it offers for virtually all acquisitions apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans. however it also doesnt necessarily require much in the way of reading between lines to unpack apples intentions with turi. previously known by the name of dato turi provides machine learning capabilities for web and mobile applications. among its numerous offerings turis technologies analyze massive data sets to help companies better understand and optimize key business drivers like the expected click through rate for a marketing campaign the likelihood that a marketing lead will convert to a paying customer and the chances that a current customer will unsubscribe from a companys service. these represent just a few of the capabilities turi offers its customers and they appear to be mostly geared toward developers presently. either way purchasing turi will likely benefit apple in at least two distinct ways. considering apples historic penchant for secrecy surrounding its acquisitions parsing apples intentions with turi requires a certain degree of reading between the lines. but it seems turi probably benefits apple in a few ways. image source apple. for starters integrating turis machine learning capabilities into several apple products will help improve their usefulness which should strengthen apples ecosystem in the process. as was widely noted on the companys most recent conference call apple ceo tim cook cited several ways in which artificial intelligence improves the ios user experience. for those who missed it cook saidmachine learning enables siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. . . were also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services including recommending songs apps and news. machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. the consistent theme here is that apple can apply ai to its services to make them more useful in some way for its customers. by removing or reducing minor pain points like incorrect autocorrect suggestions in text messages apple strengthens its ecosystem relative to its smartphone competitors. particularly in light of impressive recent offeringsin the form of samsungs galaxy 00NUMBER00 and note 00NUMBER00 the pressure is clearly on apple to continue to improve its own user experience in ways both large and small. additionally apple could also bake in turis analytics and big data capabilities into its own third party app development platform. this isnt a guaranteed potential move as integrating turis technology into apples own products. however providing app developers with more robust analytics also seems like another way apple can bolster ios appeal as a destination for developers which carries its own benefits to apples overall software ecosystem. with turi apple seems better positioned to improve its own software products in a host of smaller ways. this might sound insignificant but with billions of dollars on the line each quarter minor differences can translate into a major impact for a financial behemoth such as apple. furthermore the companys demonstration that it understands the importance of building out its own suite of ai capabilities also bodes well for its competitive position in a future where machine learning and artificial intelligence will play an increasingly prominent role in our daily lives. because of that the decision to purchase turi seems like a small but potentially meaningful win for apple and its shareholders. a secret billion dollar stock

the last 00NUMBER00 years. this chart shows the complete aapl history. aapldata by ycharts. impressively apple stocks outperformance during its long history has largely been driven by less than 00NUMBER00 major achievements and innovations all of which proceeded to drive significant long term success for the company. key events behind aapl stock historydatesteve jobs returns from next

which was steve jobs first consumer facing product after his return to apple. the second was ipod along with more affordable models to follow including ipod mini shuffle and nano. and apples most game changing product ever was arguably iphone. along with its annual refreshes that followed the first version iphone can be largely credited as the key driver behind the bulk of apple stocks market crushing performance. before these products began meaningfully impacting apples bottom line the company struggled. indeed between its ipo in 00NUMBER00 and the end of 00NUMBER00 the stock actually underperformed the sp 00NUMBER00. after jobs was forced out of apple in 00NUMBER00 the tech giant struggled from a lack of product focus and faced major headwinds from competition namely the game changing release of microsofts windows 00NUMBER00 operating system. aapldata by ycharts. the last 00NUMBER00 years have been particularly lucrative for apple shareholders with the stock outperforming the sp about 00NUMBER00 times over. investors can thank the iphone for much of this periods return. iphone sales have soared since the devices introduction. in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months alone apple has sold a whopping 00NUMBER00 million iphones. this compares to about 00NUMBER00 million iphone sales during the devices first year. with a stock history as impressive as apples you can bet the

importantly all the returns discussed in this article were adjusted for splits. with apple delivering such impressive returns for shareholders in the past its tempting to conclude investors should expect similar results in the future. but investors should note that apple is a much larger company today. in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months alone the tech giant has earned a whopping 00NUMBER00

sometime in 00NUMBER00. while project titan is a bit of an open secret its still unclear if apple plans to sell the car rent it as a car as a service business or sell its technology to automakers. heres a rundown of the key aspects of apples car project and why the company could make a lotof money from it. apple has revealed nothing about the details of project titan or even that it exists but that hasnt stopped the leaks. the first to break most of the news about apples car project was the wall street journal. the paper first saidthe vehicle was expected to debut in 00NUMBER00 but more recent detailsfrom the information paywalled now points to a 00NUMBER00 release. the vehicle is widely believed to be electric and a recent rumor says that a south korean company is making cylindrical lithium ion batteries with hollowed out centers. the design is expected to make them lighter and protect against overheating according tosouth korean etnews. apple has already been in talks with companies about building charging stations and has hired its own battery charging experts away from bmwand google as well according to reuters. earlier rumors suggested the car may be fully driverless but its much more likely that the apple car will have some level of self driving capability like teslas model s and x or hondas inexpensive semi autonomous civic. ihsautomotive predicts that 00NUMBER00 million vehicleswill have some level of driverless capability by 00NUMBER00 so it makes sense that apple would include some of that technology at the cars debut. apple wont build the cars itself of course and is reportedly working with a canadian australian company called magna steyr to do that. bmw and daimlerwere originally in talks with apple about producing the vehicles but those talks fell through when apple reportedly didnt want to share any of the vehicles data with the automakers. apples car project has gone through at least a handful of leaders since its inception or so we think. theres been speculation that apples chief designer jony ives was heading up most of the car project but its also been reportedthat steve zadesky formerly a fordengineer that helped oversee ipod and iphone teams was heading up project titan. the latest buzz is that apple has actually brought back bob mansfield to oversee its car project. mansfield was a longtime apple executive who backed off of daily involvement with the company several years ago and previously headed up hardware engineering for the ipad imac and macbook air. apple reportedly has about 00NUMBER00 people working on the project and was even able to snag teslas vp of vehicle engineering chris porritt. he was reportedly in charge of the project after zadesky left but is likely working under mansfield now. apple also hired a key deep learning expert jonathan cohen away from nvidia. the company makes graphics processing units gpus mainly for the gaming market but its also emerging as a major player in the driverless car space. cohens addition adds more fuel to the fire that apple is serious about pursuing driverless car features. to date there have been exactly zero good mockups of what a possible apple car will look like. motortrendtried to guess at how the vehicle might eventually look but it came up with some pretty terribly concepts to be honest. so far the best guess the motley fool has is that itll look something very close to this. heres where things get reallyinteresting. selling a car directly to consumers isnt out of the question but morgan stanley analyst katy huberty believes apple might eventually release its car as a service. huberty and her research team think apple is planning to enter the shared mobility market  which is expected to be worth 00NUMBER00 trillionby 00NUMBER00 where consumers rent out vehicles and share them rather than own them outright. huberty said in a research note earlier this summer that apple is increasing rd spending far faster than carmakers are and most of the money is going to a shared mobility play. apple is spending about 00NUMBER00 billion in research and development right now three times more than it did four years ago indicating that its gearing up for a major product. and huberty thinks an icar could bring in massive revenue for the company. with apple outspending the major auto oems on this opportunity we believe apple could gain at least 00NUMBER00 percent of the shared mobility market similar to the companys share in smartphones today. thats a substantial percentage and it could bring apple an amazing 00NUMBER00 billion in annual revenue and 00NUMBER00 in earnings per share by 00NUMBER00. apple investors shouldnt dismiss the apple car rumors as just another pet project apple is toying with. the tech giant has seen its iphone sales slip and its become increasingly clear that selling smartphones may not be the companys key revenue driver in the coming years. were still a few years away from seeing what apples been working on but its likely the companys next product segment will be cars. or as apple chief operating office jeff williams referred to the segment last year the ultimate mobile device. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

waterproof and can charge wirelessly. but apples nearly one year old iphone still beats or more accurately crushes samsungs latest and greatest in an app speed test. galaxy note 00NUMBER00. image source samsung. samsungs newest phones poor performance against the iphone 00NUMBER00 was demonstrated in an app test by phonebuff on youtube via macrumors. the iphone 00NUMBER00 has had itself quite the year when it comes to speed tests said phonebuffs david rahimi in the video. he went on to cite the apple phones impressive track record at outperforming many of the worlds fastest smartphones. but rahimi wanted to see if the note 00NUMBER00 could take back the speed test title that the note 00NUMBER00 lost or if the iphone 00NUMBER00 could pull off what has never been done here at phonebuff and go undefeated in its lifecycle. in phonebuffs app speed test which included a succession of apps the two phones would have to open and one video to be rendered the iphone 00NUMBER00 achieved one of the biggest leads rahimi had ever seen on a speed test at phonebuff by the time there were only a few apps left to open. and after finishing its first lap of opening apps the iphone 00NUMBER00 proceeded to complete another lap before the note 00NUMBER00 even finished its first. as for the note 00NUMBER00 time during the test it finished its first lap in two minutes and four seconds or 00NUMBER00 seconds after the iphone 00NUMBER00 finished its secondlap. while this does mark the first time a smartphone in phonebuffs app speed tests a smartphone upheld its record during entire first year lifecycle the iphones stellar performance isnt entirely surprising. thanks to the companys relentless focus on the user experience apple is already known for separating itself from the pack when it comes to performance in pcs and laptops a lead over competing pc manufacturers that has actually increased during the past decade. and now apples same approach to tightening integration of design software and hardware seems to be paying off with iphone. interestingly one of the iphones advantages stems from a bold bet the company made years ago to begin developing its own a series chips based on arm holdings based architecture. designing its own chips the move took the companys vertical integration for iphone one step further than its mac lineup since macs still use intelchips. apples increasing investments over the years in its a series designs have yielded impressive results turning the iphone maker into a formidable chip designer in its own right and helping iphones user experience best competition. with results from this new speed test making rounds just weeks before apple launches its latest iphone which is rumored to include an even faster and more efficient

price of an ordinary or typical house called the benchmark home by the canadian mortgage housing corporation in vancouver b. c. to 00NUMBER00. this despite the fact that the average income in the city below the national average is in the neighborhood of 00NUMBER00. to put this into some perspective the monthly payment would be nearly 00NUMBER00. a typical citizen of vancouver would have to devote his entire income to the mortgage payments cant pay property taxes or eat. but since this benchmark price is 00NUMBER00 higher than it was a year ago why wouldnt wealthy foreign individuals and companies want to play house in canada as a bonus governmental authorities are busy researching the phenomenon with gusto since theres plenty of evidence that no taxes are being paid on these windfall trades. in canada you need only put the property in the name of a friend son or daughter and have them live in the house to avoid capital gains taxes. everything seems rosy when riding a hot investment until one thing goes awry. we never seem to know what thatll be but experienced money managers usually get the heebeejeebies just before it happens. i felt the same way when everyone i talked to like my brother in law seemed to own apple aapl shares were self proclaimed experts on the companys products and strategy and were always buying more of it. at the time for us whod seen the movie many times before it was an accident waiting to happen. all it took was one disappointing quarter to knock the wind out of the companys shares. click to enlargetwo potential threats to housing in canada are becoming evident. the canadian real estate association released a number of stats recently. this trend in particular is worrisomethe number of homes trading hands via canadian mls® systems fell by 00NUMBER00 percent month over month in july 00NUMBER00. with similar monthly declines having been posted in may and june national sales activity in july came in 00NUMBER00 percent below the record set in april 00NUMBER00. one of the more serious indications in my experience as a portfolio manager of trouble pending for a security is when the price continues to rise but there are fewer and fewer trades. there are more scientific reasons but my own explanation is there are fewer and fools. the next leg is many trades mostly selling. this may also be why the inventory of homes for sale is declining or sales as a percent of new listings has been rising. housing has an interesting dynamic differing from actual securities. as we see from the vancouver situation above there comes a point at which potential sellers from the home market are constrained from transacting providing supply. despite a ridiculously attractive price it will be impossible to find a home to buy and move in to that isnt also ridiculously priced. click to enlargeclick to enlargethe other pin that will inevitably puncture canadas inflated housing market not to mention bond and stock markets that are almost universally considered overvalued is a move by the fed to test a bump in interest rates. below is the yield curve for government of canada bonds in 00NUMBER00 at about the same point in time as my h d was featured in the financial post pictured above. click to enlargei am using 00NUMBER00 for two reasons. one is that i consider it to be more or less a normal time keeping in mind that the concept of normality is very subjective. back in the early 00NUMBER00 mortgage rates in canada peaked at 00NUMBER00. at that time 00NUMBER00 interest rates were becoming pretty normal in the minds of people. the other reason is that although it seems likeages ago 00NUMBER00 is fairly recent. the financial crisis isnt so long ago that people have forgotten how bad things got and the mess was ignited by a major meltdown in the u. s. housing market. what many especially younger folks dont realize is that we go through mini meltdowns in housing markets quite frequently. we humans have a tendency to rely too heavily on what just happened when trying to guess what will happen next. it gets us into lots of trouble. a money manager spends his whole life fighting off this behavioral flaw and those that cant suppress it usually end up having very short careers as money managers. now take a look at this years yield curve for canada bonds. click to enlargethe yield curve this year not exactly up to date but captures the overall lower structure of rates is still very much a product of the financial crisis. pressure by governments and central banks to keep interest rates low encourage borrowing and spending have not abated in years. it is natural but dangerous to assume that in future years or even months interest rates will remain at levels not too far from where they have been in recent years. why is this important because mortgage rates are typically a few percentage points higher than government bond rates as we know. just for fun what if you have a 00NUMBER00 year mortgage with an interest rate of 00NUMBER00. long term government bond yields are actually lower right now than indicated in the chart. and what if suddenlythings change and youre forced to negotiate a new normalrate of 00NUMBER00. ill keep the math really simple annual compounding rather than semi annual and lax rounding among other things. the average price of a house in canada is around 00NUMBER00. say 00NUMBER00 of this is financed by a mortgage or 00NUMBER00. at 00NUMBER00 the annual payments are very roughly something like 00NUMBER00 or very roughly 00NUMBER00 a month. bump the mortgage rate to 00NUMBER00 which doesnt sound so much higher and the annual payment grows to well over 00NUMBER00 or somewhere around 00NUMBER00 monthly. i can promise you its unlikely your take home pay will increase 00NUMBER00 to help soften the blow. and if that isnt bad enough suppose you can no longer make the higher payments and want to sell the property you paid 00NUMBER00 for a house that you could now sell for only 00NUMBER00 which is what you owe. you might correctly argue that this sort of wholesale change in market rates is unlikely to happen overnight. maybe not but the result is the same. home or investment property youve pretty much lost 00NUMBER00 when you were hoping to make money. ouchthe hot housing market has not only been fueled by foreigners investingtrading in canada but also by canadians using as much leverage as they can to participate as well. the amount of debt assumed by households has ballooned. rising home prices makes net worth look like its also skyrocketing enabling regular homeowners and speculators to borrow more. no doubt foreign investors have taken advantage of low mortgage rates to help finance their purchases but theres not enough data to determine to what extent. bottom line when the fed moves so will the bank of canada and profitable trades will suddenly become losses. especially foreign investors the fast money will do what all traders do under these circumstances sell rapidly desperate to avoid even steeper losses. but doesnt everyone expect a bump in interest rates is on the horizon so shouldnt markets already have this built in again its that recency bias that slows the corrective mechanisms. yes its expected but the consequences are grossly underestimated because housing prices have been rising for so long and mortgage rates have been so low for so long everyone imagines a lowering of the tide rather than a tidal wave. i know its going to happen i just dont believe it will be that bad. its human nature. after all there are no signs of runaway inflation global growth is slow but looking better and there are still difficulties with the banking sector in europe. theres no need for higher interest rates evidenced by the reluctance of the fed or any other central bank to increase interest rates. everybody who bought into canadian real estate is making money and everybody is still buying into real

portfolio best mutual funds or etfs and the best investment season of your life behind you and blow it all in a moment by selling in a panic or by not selling before a panic there are oh so many ways depending on your unique personality and situation. it is this behavioral risk weve recently been discussing that may point successful people in the direction of a professional financial advisor whose role would essentially be to get between you and your money so you dont self destruct. i recall one fellow i knew a neighbor on my block whom id see very frequently. he was very intelligent had a hit movie way back when that he was still living off quite nicely and an investment portfolio of which he was very proud. when he first asked me about it or elements of it such as his investment in apple aapl i was happy to discuss it with him at length. i got less enthusiastic after the 00NUMBER00 time and as the years went by i found myself sometimes rushing to my car in avoidance. nice warm friendly guy but obsessed in an unhealthy way i thought with his portfolio. his problem was that as his portfolio continued to get ever larger so too did his fears of ruin grow in proportion. he was intrigued with the idea of getting a good financial advisor i recommended one of the best i knew whom i thought suitable they discussed his portfolio for a session lasting something like six hours. ultimately though he just couldnt accept the idea of paying the advisors fee given how well he had done on his own amassing those assets. im sure his portfolio has grown enormously since that ill fated meeting with the advisor but im also certain the fellow has little peace of mind as he tortures himself daily with stock market reports. if youve not already picked this up from previous posts of mine ill make explicit here that i believe investment success often has deeper roots in ones personality than ones portfolio. i dont assume my neighbor will enjoy all that wealth im certainly rooting for him because as i see it hes invested at least as much emotionally as he is financially. in an article titled how to retire on 00NUMBER00 marshmallows sa contributor t rail investor describes the famous stanford marshmallow experiment by psychologist walter mischel. in a nutshell mischel offered preschoolers the choice of a marshmallow right away or two if they could hang on for about 00NUMBER00 minutes. the significance of the study was not in the data showing the proportion of kids who were able to defer gratification for a greater reward later about a third but in the future life outcomes he observed by tracking them over time. the two marshmallow crowd had higher sat scores higher educational attainment favorable body mass index lower propensity to addictive behavior etc. i think t rail investor is correct in assuming that mischels research insight is applicable to investors. controlling for the correct variables in investment selection is one factor but can investors control themselves at all the right times e. g. buying selling and all points in betweenif by extrapolation from mischels study one assumes that a third of investors can do so then it would behoove the other two thirds to find a way impose the needed discipline externally. hiring a good advisor may be one way to do that. please share your thoughts as always in our comments section.

largest segment in its most recent quarter. its large share of apples top line highlights its importance to the companys business. indeed apple management noted in its most recent earnings call it expected its services revenue to be the size of a 00NUMBER00 company by next year. but the segment wasnt always this important to apples results. in the same quarter three years ago apples services revenue was the companys fourth largest segment and accounted for 00NUMBER00 of revenue compared to 00NUMBER00 of revenue in the third fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. going forward it looks like apples services segment will only become more crucial to apples business. heres where the segments growth is coming from and why its likely to continue to steadily grow in the coming years. apples services segment includes revenue from itunes apple music the app store licensing service parts icloud and apple pay. notably however while the segment includes revenue from a range of apple services revenue from the app store may represent the most exciting opportunity for the segment. app store. image source apple. the importance of app store revenue for apples services segment is highlighted by the companys non gaap installed base related purchases metric which adjusts apples services revenue by accounting for app store sales and certain content sold through the itunes store on a gross basis instead of the net basis they are accounted for in apples services segment. this single adjustment nearly doubles apples services revenue in 00NUMBER00 and it helps the segment achieve impressive 00NUMBER00 year over year growth. comparatively apples year over year growth in services revenue without this adjustment is just 00NUMBER00. despite the app stores increasing importance to apple highlighted by the difference this adjustment makes other newer contributors to apples services segment hold promise as well as potential future add on services. recent examples of new services apple has tacked on are apple pay and apple music. pointing to just how well newly launched services can resonate with its installed base of users apple said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter that tens of millions of users are now using apple pay and that monthly active users of the service were up 00NUMBER00 compared to the same month one year ago. investors betting apples services segment will be more important in the future dont have to base these forecasts on speculation. recent performance from the segment clearly portrays an optimistic narrative for the segment. first consider the accelerating year over year growth rates in apples non gaap installed base related purchases. since apple started tracking this method in the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 the metric has moved higher every quarter. in apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 installed base related purchases were up 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter. and this growth rate hit 00NUMBER00 by fiscal 00NUMBER00. second keep in mind that apples services segment grew faster than any other product segment in 00NUMBER00. apples second fastest growing segment was ipad tracking at 00NUMBER00 year over year revenue growth. as apples services segment continues to grow investors should pay more attention to it. in addition investors should keep an eye on any new services apple launches to see whether they could be a catalyst for even more revenue in the segment. currently apple may generate the majority of its revenue and profits from iphone but investors should expect services to become more important as the company continues to tap into its loyal active installed base of users. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but

expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  for investors examining applenasdaq aapl its critical to understand how the technology giants devices are selling and the calculation that perhaps best expresses the health of apples products is their average selling price asp. image source apple. apples overall asps have trended downward in recent quarters. what does that mean for apple investors today lets review apples asp metrics and see how the figure drives apples broader financial performance. a products asp is the revenue from its sales divided by the number of units sold in a single period. for product driven companies like apple asp calculations provide pivotal information about its financial performance and by extension the performance of its stock price. in fact theres a clear relationship between apples iphone asp and its stock price movementsimage sources apple investor relations and yahoo finance. the iphone accounts for the majority of the tech giants revenue and profit. in apples most recent quarter the iphone segment alone produced 00NUMBER00 billion of the companys 00NUMBER00 billion in sales about 00NUMBER00. moreover the iphones share of apple revenue exceeds two thirds of total sales in some quarters following new device handset launches. and the iphones asp matters even more when you begin considering how each device drives overall profitability. apple consolidates its operations under a single profit and loss statement meaning investors cant tell how costs such as marketing and rd are spread among the companys various products. since the iphone has the highest gross margin in apples device family though its safe to assume that the device generates the lions share of apples profits. that makes the iphone crucial in determining apples overall financial performance each quarter. keeping in mind that the iphone ipad and mac the three devices for which apple provides individualized data are at different phases of their product life cycles heres how asps changed in apples most recent quarter. apple average selling price asp by 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 o y 00NUMBER00 source apple investor relations. if the iphone figure alarms you heres some context. the financial impact of the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se landed during the quarter and since the base 00NUMBER00 gb version retails for 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 less than the introductory price for the 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00  a decline in apples asp was almost inevitable. cfo luca maestri said as much on apples conference call though he said he expects iphone asps to improve during the current quarter. looking further out the anticipated debut of the iphone 00NUMBER00 next month and perhaps a radically redesigned 00NUMBER00 anniversary iphone in late 00NUMBER00 seem likely to drive a renewed interestin apples more expensive and profitable handsets. so i think concerns about a prolonged decline in iphone asps seem overblown. as for apples other core devices the ipad and mac the ipad continues to struggle for meaningful volume growth with unit sales falling 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. however the introduction of the higher priced 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro has helped bolster ipad asps in the face of that weakness. its unclear how much the ipad pro has affected mac sales. with small updates to the mac lineup in recent quarters it could be that consumers are waiting on the sidelines. in any event investors will want to watch the shipment data in apples third largest reporting segment in the coming quarters. however both the ipad and mac divisions pale in comparison with the iphone so investors would do well to focus the bulk of their efforts on the asps in apples largest division. a

suggests it will the tech giant could be sending out invitations for a september launch event on thursday or friday of this week. as the launch event approaches heres a look at why apple investors are always so interested in iphone and why this particular iphone refresh is so important. the no. 00NUMBER00 reason apple investors are interested in the iphones success is simply because it represents by farthe largest portion of the tech giants revenue. indeed during apples most recent quarter iphone accounted for about 00NUMBER00 of the tech giants total revenue. notably however even this metric understates the share of apples revenue iphone captures. in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months a period that better captures the full seasonality of iphone sales apples iphone segment accounted for a whopping 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. data retrieved from apples quarterly sec filings. chart by author. apples other segments pale in comparison to iphone. none of apples other segments ipad mac services or other products accounts for more than 00NUMBER00 on its own. even more apples ipad and mac segments together only add up to a fifth of the tech giants total revenue. another reason iphone is so important to investors is because its one of the companys most profitable segments if not the most profitable. while apple doesnt break down operating margin by product management has indicated on a number of occasions that iphones share of the companys operating profits is even larger than its share of revenue. considering iphone accounts for the lions share of apples revenue and an even larger share of profits the product segment truly can make or break the stocks future. for instance if iphone revenue increases over the next decade apple shareholders will likely see excellent returns. on the other hand if iphone revenue struggles to grow or even worse declines even apples price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 today may be too high of a price to pay. but theres a more specific timely reason for investors to be interested in apples rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 launch next month. iphone revenue has been declining for two quarters in a row. many apple investors therefore may be wondering have iphone sales peakediphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. apples year over year declines in iphone revenue started in the second quarter of the flagship year for the iphone 00NUMBER00 highlighting its failure to live up to the blockbuster flagship year that the iphone 00NUMBER00 had had. in apples second fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 iphone revenue decreased 00NUMBER00 year over year. and this trend worsened in apples most recent quarter with iphone revenue falling 00NUMBER00 year over year. adding fuel to the fire apple guided for total revenue in the current quarter the final quarter for the flagship year of the iphone 00NUMBER00 to decline about 00NUMBER00 suggesting management anticipates another difficult year over year comparison for iphone. combine the iphones huge share of apples revenue and profits with its declining sales in recent quarters and its easy to see why iphone 00NUMBER00 in particular is so important. if the new smartphone fails to reinvigorate growth in the segment investors could lose confidence in the tech giants ability to grow its business from current levels. apple is expected to announce its newest iphone lineup on wednesday sept. 00NUMBER00. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres

weeks later but he clearly hasnt moved on in the eyes of those who are now critical of cook. apple investors have been served reasonably well under cooks care. the stocks return including dividends has more than doubled over his five year reign up 00NUMBER00 in that time. thats slightly behind the tech heavy nasdaqs return but it compares favorably to the sp 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gain. his run hasnt been a runaway success. the iphone product line jobs introduced nine summers ago continues to be the primary driver here accounting for 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue and likely even more of its operating profit. outside of the perpetual refreshing of the iphone ipad apple tv and mac lines there isnt a lot that wasnt around when jobs himself was still around. the one new major consumer product line last years apple watch dominates its niche but it hasnt done for the smartwatch what the ipod did for portable media players the iphone did for smartphones or the ipad did for tablets. throw in apple sorely overpaying for its beats acquisition and the ipad peaking in popularity two years ago and you dont have a very flattering snapshot of cooks reign. but that view is wrong. its incomplete. cooks wooden anniversary as ceo comes at a crummy time. apple is just coming off of a year over year decline in quarterly revenue for the first time in 00NUMBER00 years. however with apple generating far more revenue and earnings than it was under jobs its undeniable that things couldve been worse. theres a fate far worse than merely being unspectacular and it is it pains me to say what may have happened under jobs if he had been calling the shots over the past five years. this isnt meant to come off as blasphemous or disrespectful to the man who made it all possible. i live surrounded by my apple products today because of the genius that was oneman. however every ceo has a season and these past five years likely wouldnt have been much of a harvest with jobs and his headstrong ways. he likely wouldve pushed through the high def tv he was working on before his passing he had cracked it after all even as the market was falling more in line with cheap set top devices like the apple tv the tech giant already had. he possibly wouldve resisted making iphones larger a move that caused a huge spike in business two years ago or ipads smaller a move that may have extended its fleeting success. he once derided the ipad mini sized tablets put out by rivals as tweeners for being too big to be smartphones and too small to be tablets. apple got a big boost by stretching the middle and going plus with the iphone and mini with the ipad. its also easy to see the stock lacking some of the support it has today if it lacked the generous yield it now commands. jobs never seemed to warm up to payouts. he preferred to hoard money. apple hadnt paid a cash dividend since 00NUMBER00 but that changed within months of cook taking over. its certainly possible that jobs couldve dreamed up the next big thing in these past five years. there may even be a good chance of that. obviously we will never know. however visionaries with confidence can sometimes gamble a fortune away. jobs was the right kind of leader to take apple as far as he did but the transition to a new ceo came at the right time when apple needed something else. heres a tip of the hat to cook for being the kind of dutiful steward that makes sure the baton isnt dropped or carelessly squandered and an even bigger tip to jobs for getting the baton that far. a secret billion dollar stock

just weeks away media attention has been shifting to what comes next for apple inc. nasdaqaapl. and what comes next could be rattling for some. bloombergis now reporting that the iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 will lose the iconic home button. aapl is expected to to take the wraps off the iphone 00NUMBER00 by mid september. normally the rumor mill would be in overdrive at this point filled with speculation about apples new iphone. it isactive â€¦ however much of the posting is looking ahead to 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is getting less attention than normal because it has every indication of being boring. for months spy shots and insider info have seeped out visions of a new iphone that looks virtually identical to last years model. and the one from the year before. internals will be tweaked and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will likely get an improved dual camera system. but theres little excitement around it. in fact the current speculation around the iphone 00NUMBER00 is that it wont be called that at all. instead apple might dub it the iphone 00NUMBER00. if that one pans out it would feel like even aapl was shrugging. the best etfs on the planet a special reportthe iphone 00NUMBER00 could be radically different. so with little excitement around the iphone 00NUMBER00 attention is starting to be filtered even further into the future. apple is moving to a three year product cycle on its iphones making 00NUMBER00 and the iphone 00NUMBER00 the next big release. there have already been multiple claims that the company is adopting a curved oled displayon at least one iphone model taking a page from the design book of rival samsungotcmktsssnlf. now a new report from bloombergis suggesting the iphone 00NUMBER00 will adopt an even more radical change. one element that has remained consistent since the original iphone was released in 00NUMBER00 is the home button. year after year the physical button is there on the bottom of the iphones front face. sure apple has improved it. notably building in the touch id fingerprint sensor was a big leap forward. but it has always been there. however bloombergsmark gurman reported yesterday that the iconic button is on its way outapple is already at work on a major redesign of the iphone for 00NUMBER00 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the home buttonas macrumorspoints out apple design guru jony ive has long wanted to build an iphone with a front that lacks bezels and looks like a single sheet of glass. the home button destroys that minimalist aesthetic. not to mention that the physical button is a point of failure anda potential access point for water. in the quest for a more durable and waterproof iphone eliminating the home button would definitely help. however home button functionality is critical to ios so apple couldnt literally scrub it. instead apple would need to use improvements to the 00NUMBER00 touch pressure sensitivity introduced with the iphone 00NUMBER00 to create a virtual home button and fingerprint scanner integrated into the display. 00NUMBER00 is a huge year for apple. its the first launch year in the new three year iphone release cycle. more importantly it also marks the 00NUMBER00 of the iphone. and it comes as iphone sales critical to aapls bottom line continue to lose momentum. those are three big reasons why aapl is expected to pull out all the stops. apple touch disease is a ticking time bomban iphone 00NUMBER00 with a slick glass front that eliminates bezels and ditches the old school home button would definitely make a splash. as of this writing brad moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. what we think we know about the iphone 00NUMBER00 expected to release a third

whether aging tech giant applenasdaq aapl can deliver the same juicy returns for which its so famous. though still certainly a force in the investing world todays apple relies on a more diverse playbook including share buybacks and dividends to generate returns for its shareholders rather than relying solely on torrent earnings and profit growth as it once did. case in point apple has emerged as something of a share buyback and dividend powerhouse since initiating its capital return program in 00NUMBER00. thanks to its truly monumental financial resources 00NUMBER00 billion in net cash and investments as of its most recent quarter  apple has developed an impressive track record of returning cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. heres a quick snapshot of apples share repurchase history over the past four fiscal years. apple stock buyback history asr open market purchasesfy 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of shares in 00NUMBER00 repurchase 00NUMBER00 amounts in us 00NUMBER00 source apple sec filings. as of its most recent quarterly report apple has utilized roughly 00NUMBER00 billion of the 00NUMBER00 billion the company has earmarked for stock buybacks. thats an absolutely incredible about of capital committed to repurchasing apples shares especially considering the companys entire market capitalization of 00NUMBER00 billion. it demonstrates how apple can utilize its massive financial resources to continue to create returns for its investors even if its days of breakneck growth lie behind it. it also bears noting that apple has allocated a disproportionate amount of its capital return program toward stock buybacks instead of dividends. in fact apple has earmarked 00NUMBER00 of the 00NUMBER00 billion in its capital return program specifically to fuel share buybacks. as such apples clear preference toward stock buybacks also suggests they contain some kind of advantage over dividends. why is thatwith chapters of corporate finance textbooks dedicated to the subject breaking down the advantages and drawbacks of stock buybacks especially when compared to cash dividends can quickly grow esoteric. i dont want to put you to sleep here but its handy for investors to have a general framework for why companies pursue stock buybacks so lets quickly review. at their most basic buybacks are one of two principle methods through which a company can reward its shareholders with their excess cash flow the other is dividends. generally speaking stock buybacks benefit investors by helping increase a companys stock price. here its helpful to think of companys profits as a pie. buying back stock reduces the number of shares entitled to a companys profits. its akin to reducing the number of slices of the pie making each slice more valuable. as homer simpson would say mmmmm. pie. additionally stock buybacks carry an additional tax advantage. investors who own a stock for more than a year are taxed at the lower long term capital gains rate when they sell their stock compared to dividends which are taxed as ordinary income. so as a general rule of thumb stock buybacks help increase a stocks price and typically result in a lower tax bill when investors sell their shares. stock repurchases can also be viewed in theory as a sign that a company sees its shares as undervalued though this can prove tenuous in practice. companies are aware of this exact effect and some will attempt to use this signal to support their stock price. for example the now defunct lehman brothersfamously instituted a stock buyback in late january 00NUMBER00 in an attempt to instill confidence in its rickety stock price. ten months later the company no longer existed. to be sure many companies use buybacks to reward their investors in a rational and ethical manner but its important to caveat that some companies use it for more self serving aims as well. either way at a high level stock buybacks should be thought of as a more tax efficient way for a company to reward investors than dividends in cases when its shares are undervalued. companies with low pe ratios like apple can benefit tremendously from stock buybacks. but its important to note were just scratching the surface on this important and somewhat complex topic. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

news stock advice trading tipsa week ago we published a story about a problem surfacing with the  apple inc. nasdaqaapl iphone 00NUMBER00 lineup especially the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. so called touch diseasewas rendering apples first generation of larger smartphone useless and the company had no fix. now reports say touch disease occurrences are surging to the point where it is the single biggest iphone issue that apple stores have to deal with. apple insider analyzed data from four of aapls high traffic apple stores and discovered that touch disease is becoming an increasingly growing problem. according to apple  insider between aug. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 apple technicians were diagnosing touch disease at an alarming pace. in the four stores where the data was collected 00NUMBER00 of iphone 00NUMBER00 owners who had brought their device in for service were suffering from touch disease. a whopping 00NUMBER00 of iphone 00NUMBER00 plus owners faced a touch disease diagnosis. thats 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 plus smartphones in three days at just four apple stores. and there are 00NUMBER00 apple stores in the u. s. alone. by the way touch disease means the end of your iphone it eventually renders the device unusable and is not repairable. 00NUMBER00 companies that could go bankrupt soonwhen the numbers were tallied apple  insiderfound that touch disease was accounting for 00NUMBER00 of overall iphone service traffic in the subject apple stores. that makes it the most common iphone issue being dealt with by aapls genius bar. there is no fix for the problem which has been traced to a chip that breaks off the iphone 00NUMBER00 series flexible motherboard over time. the only option aapl has been able to offer is a replacement iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 plus. this isnt exactly a popular solution because the replacement phones are usually refurbished. in other words the replacements might be further along their way in suffering from touch disease too. in fact the  apple insiderpost quotes an apple store employee who says touch disease appears to be widespread among those refurbished replacement unitsits about time that the apple press got a whiff of the problem one apple genius said to us. im getting tired of pulling service stock out of the box and seeing the exact same problem that the customer has on the replacement before i leave backstage. also because many iphone 00NUMBER00 units are out of warranty at this point aapl is charging many customers for those replacements. the data was collected from apple stores after the initial story broke. that doesnt take into account things like iphones diagnosed by third parties. apple has sold nearly 00NUMBER00 million iphones in the past two years alone. a big part of that success has been a carefully cultivated image of premium design and high quality hardware. touch disease and the high failure rate of its flagship iphone 00NUMBER00 plus after just two years is a big black eye thats threatening to get worse. the timing is horrible too as aapl is getting set to unveil its newest iphone lineup. apple still has no official repair or replacement program in place. with iphone 00NUMBER00 and especially iphone 00NUMBER00 plus failures reaching epidemic levels apple needs to do something. touch disease threatens to overshadow the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch. as of this writing

invitations sent out to press on monday. see you on the 00NUMBER00 reads the invitation which pictures the top half of an apple logo. apples 00NUMBER00 product launch event. image source apple. heres what apple will likely unveil at its event next week. the main product expected to debut at apples wednesday event is its flagship iphone. given that the company refreshes the iphone every year in september this is basically a given. as for what features to expect from the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus macrumors is anticipating the phone will keep the same overall form factor introduced two years ago with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus a form factor it carried over to the iphone 00NUMBER00 as well. however macrumors expectsseveral changes to the exterior for both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus mainly the elimination of a headphone jack a flush pressure sensitive home button and redesigned antenna bands. but the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus are expected to receive more substantial performance upgrades including an upgraded processor improved water resistance higher storage capacity and an improved camera. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in particular is expected to get a dual lens camera. the iphone will likely be the product investors are most interested inat the event as it accounts for well over half of apples revenue and profits. another possible product to debut during apples event next week is a new version of the apple watch. macrumors juli clover explainsapple may use the event to debut a second generation apple watch said to include better waterproofing an improved processor and a built in gps chip. design changes are not expected for the next generation apple watch but new materials and new bands are always a possibility. apple rotates its apple watch band offerings on a regular basis and we expect to see new designs this fall. the apple watch. image source apple. unlike the iphone the apple watch represents a very small portion of apples revenue. it is lumped into apples other products segment which accounted for 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in apples most recent quarter. but a refreshed apple watch could still be important as the category is still new and it could represent a growth opportunity for apple. both apples macbook pro and its desktop mac lineup are about due for an update but rumors dont point to new releases for these segments at the event. beyond these rumors its difficult to predict any new services or updates for its existing services such as apple pay icloud apple music itunes or siri. its arguably easier for apple to keep new services secret since they dont always require collaboration with third party suppliers so its still possible that apple has something in the works the ever active apple rumor mill isnt aware of. furthermore the tech giant hasnt completely lost the ability to keep some hardware designs secret this was the case with the companys 00NUMBER00 launched mac pro and even the 00NUMBER00 introduced apple watch. a hardware surprise however is unlikely apples sprawling global supply chain makes keeping these ventures out of the limelight difficult. apple will livestream its event on wednesday sept. 00NUMBER00 at 00NUMBER00 a. m. pdt. stay tuned at the motley fool for analysis of any announcements the company makes. a secret

time when losing your cell phone meant racing to have your provider turn it off before whoever stole or found it ran up a big bill by making calls on your plan. that scenario largely went away when limited minutes stopped being a thing but wireless phone makers still wanted to be able to protect phone owners when a device fell into the wrong hands. many of them have done that by adding kill switches the ability to remotely turn off a lost or stolen phone. the addition of that technology serves as a major deterrent to theft. a thief has little use for a phone that gets bricked by its manufacturer or service provider. as kill switches become more common and laws mandating them have begun to pop up phone theft may become a thing of the past. applenasdaq aapl however wants to take things a step further. instead of merely rendering a stolen iphone or ipad useless the company wants to catch the person who stole it. to make that happen apple has filed a patent for biometric capture for unauthorized user identificationtechnology which would use an iphones or ipads touch id module camera and other sensors to store an unauthorized users information. basically apple wants to do the high tech version of using a video call to get a look at the person who stole your phone which carries the threat of them being caught. apple has filed for a patent for a new security feature. image source apple. your iphone and ipad both have the needed sensors and cameras to record information that could help catch thieves. now the company wants to use that technology to make that happen. apple laid out how that would work in the patent application which detailed that first an event would have to happen to trigger the recordinga computing device may determine to capture biometric information in response to the occurrence of one or more trigger conditions. the trigger condition may be receipt of one or more instructions from one or more other computing devices detection of potential unauthorized use by the computing device normal operation of the computing device and so on. the company explained how it would use the technology embedded in its devices to help catch whoever stole itthe computing device may obtain biometric information and may store such biometric information. such biometric information may be one or more fingerprints one or more images of a current user of the computing device video of the current user audio of the environment of the computing device forensic interface use information and so on. the computing device may then provide the stored biometric information for identification of one or more unauthorized users. its a simple though perhaps technically complicated idea that could end iphone theft. its one thing to swipe a device that might end up useless. its another thing entirely to steal something that could get you caught. a patent application does not mean that apple will ever actually implement this technology. that said this type of feature simply makes too much sense for the company to not pursue it. iphones and ipads that can foil their own theft may tip some consumers toward those devices. this is a natural

author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  investorplace investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tipsafter three years of investigating the european commission recently levied a 00NUMBER00 billion bill at the foot of  apple inc. nasdaqaapl for unpaid back taxes to ireland. tim cook for his part remains steadfast in his belief that apple has paid what it owed to ireland and that the decision will be reversed. its not the first time that aapl has been accused for its unpatrioticdodging of taxes by keeping the majority of its massive cash hoard overseas. tim cook however does not see it as such. according to cook its not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. it doesnt go that the more you pay the more patriotic you are. but when it comes to ireland cook claims that apple was not given special treatment and that its tax arrangement was purely legal. the investigation claims that aapl went from 00NUMBER00 on its european profits 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. after the european unions decision tim cook took to the internet to pen a thoughtfulopen letteron the matter describing steve jobs establishment of a factory of 00NUMBER00 employees in cork irelandwe have operated continuously in cork ever since even through periods of uncertainty about our own business and today we employ nearly 00NUMBER00 people across ireland. the vast majority are still in cork  including some of the very first employees  now performing a wide variety of functions as part of apples global footprint. countless multinational companies followed apple by investing in cork and today the local economy is stronger than ever. aapl along with ireland has appealed the decision which he believes has far reaching implicationsthe european commission has launched an effort to rewrite apples history in europe ignore irelands tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. the opinion issued on 00NUMBER00 alleges that ireland gave apple a special deal on our taxes. this claim has no basis in fact or in law. we never asked for nor did we receive any special deals. we now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we dont owe them any more than weve already paid. no matter the decision cook states that aapl is committed to ireland and will continue to operate with the same level of passion and commitment. as of this writing john kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. potash corporation spikes on agrium merger

2016-08-31 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.2556277165778686,0.2245354040889166,-0.0001811253495128,companies have a number of ways they can spend their excess cash including acquiring companies paying dividends and repurchasing shares. tech giant applenasdaq aapl does all of these. but it spends far more repurchasing shares than it does making acquisitions or paying cash to shareholders. indeed since the company initiated a dividend and share repurchase program in 00NUMBER00 it has bought back a whopping 00NUMBER00 billion worth ofapple stock. with 00NUMBER00 billion of its 00NUMBER00 billion authorized for share repurchases left after the end of its fiscal third quarter how many shares could apple repurchase in fiscal 00NUMBER00 best way to guess how many shares apple could repurchase this quarter is to look back at how much apple has been spending on repurchases recently. in fiscal 00NUMBER00 apple repurchased about 00NUMBER00 billion worth of its own shares. while this is a huge sum its notably about in line with the companys average spending on repurchases since april 00NUMBER00 when apple gave its capital return program its first of four significant annual boosts to date. and repurchases havent cooled off recently in the four quarters leading up to apples most recent quarter the company averaged about 00NUMBER00 billion on share buybacks each quarter. data source quarterly sec filings for quarters shown. chart by author. going forward apples quarter to quarter spending on repurchases is likely to vary but money spent on share repurchases should continue to average around 00NUMBER00 billion each quarter. apples share repurchases in 00NUMBER00 therefore will fall somewhere around a range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. apples announcement earlier this year that it was increasing its share repurchase authorization from 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion highlights the companys ongoing commitment to continue repurchasing shares and it further supports a forecast for more of the same when it comes to repurchases. despite the apple boards recent boost to the companys share repurchase authorization some investors may wonder if management might limit stock buybacks since shares have rebounded recently from around 00NUMBER00 per share in may to about 00NUMBER00 today. after all share repurchases make more sense when the stock can be bought at a discount to fair value. and a higher price means apples money spent on repurchases doesnt go as far. but there are two key reasons apple will probably continue to buy back shares aggressively even with shares trading around 00NUMBER00. first in calendar 00NUMBER00 when apple stock was trading mostly between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 apple averaged 00NUMBER00 billion per quarter on share repurchases. this suggests management believes apple stock is still a solid value at prices above 00NUMBER00. aapldata by ychartssecond despite apple stocks recent run up the stock still has a surprisingly low price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00. its difficult to argue that apple is overvalued with a valuation like this. with apple stock trading around 00NUMBER00 theres no reason for management to rethink its share repurchase program. investors therefore should expect apple to continue prioritizing share repurchases as the company decides how to allocate its excess cash. a secret

decision by european union regulators but the age of ireland based tax shelters may be coming to an accelerated halt. do you know how elaborate apples international tax structure actually is lets have a closer look. the company was an early adopter of the double irish with a dutch sandwich strategy back in the 00NUMBER00 some even say the company invented this tax evasion tool. the double irish depended on a quirk in irish tax laws where a company could be incorporated in ireland but avoid corporate income taxes by having its central management and control in another state. so you could set up one shell company with this physical center on the emerald isle taking advantage of irelands paltry 00NUMBER00 tax rate and european domicile. another company would technically be incorporated in ireland but have its base of operations in an entirely tax free jurisdiction such as the cayman islands or bermuda. crucially the second entity was assigned the rights to important intellectual property such as technology patents or design trademarks. the first company was set up to collect revenue from the american companys non u. s. operations. however most of this top line revenue would be spent on license fees and royalties for that intellectual property nugget allowing the 00NUMBER00 irish unit to report low profits or none at all while the caribbean business pocketed the real bottom line profits in a tax free haven. the dutch sandwich part of the grand scheme refers to a third business registered in the netherlands. this is a shim between the two irish companies working around irelands substantial taxes on transferring profits out of the country. but those taxes are waived when the target is based elsewhere in the european union and the netherlands does not tax profit transfers overseas so the dutch middle man makes for a smoother and lower cost transfer to that sun drenched tax haven. now the double irish is properly discussed in the past tense. the irish tax code got an overhaul in 00NUMBER00 removing the legal basis for registering businesses in ireland with tax domiciles elsewhere. this change removes the second half of the double irish destroying the whole tax evasion tactic. however the new rules currently only apply to starting a new business. existing companies are still grandfathered in until 00NUMBER00. so apples big european tax bill has nothing to do with cupertino overstepping its legal limits. instead the commission found that ireland was wrong to allow apples tax structure to exist in the first place. apple will obviously fight this outcome tooth and nail. in a strange twist the company has an ally in the irish government. ireland has also vowed to overturn the european commissions verdict which leaves the country fighting to keep apple from paying it money. this sounds silly at first glance but it makes sense when you consider irelands place as a favored business center under light taxation. irish regulators fear the apple decision may lead to a lemming trail of foreign businessesseeking new tax shelters elsewhere long before that looming 00NUMBER00 deadline kicks in. you may have heard apple complaining that it cant take profits home from overseas until the repatriation taxis lowered but the company has actually been preparing to shift some overseas cash back to domestic shores by pre paying some of the expected tax bills. five years ago longtime apple analyst katy huberty revealedthat the company indeed pays some domestic taxes on foreign earnings. at the time she used this fact as ammunition in favor of an apple dividend. the dividend policy followed a few months later and apple is still following its old policy of paying down some foreign repatriation fees in advance. heres the evidencefiscal yeartotal tax rateeffective domestic tax rateeffective foreign tax 00NUMBER00 source apples sec filings. the irish strategy keeps overseas taxes very low. however apple routinely pays nearly double the 00NUMBER00 federal tax rate on domestic pre tax earnings. this is a symptom of uncle sam collecting taxes above and beyond his federal and state levies to cover some of those troubling repatriation fees in advance. when i checked in on this phenomenon in 00NUMBER00 apples total tax rate stopped at 00NUMBER00. the foreign tax bill amounted to just 00NUMBER00 of overseas profits while the domestic tax rate ballooned to 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 reform seems to have steered apple in a new direction but the double irish is still working wonders. keep in mind that only 00NUMBER00 of apples pre tax profits come from domestic sales and the balance keeps tipping further and further overseas. in 00NUMBER00 the domestic portion of ebit profits was 00NUMBER00. apple spearheaded the charge into irish caribbean tax strategies 00NUMBER00 years ago. now pretty much every multinational business worth its salt has followed suit and now apple must lead the way to a new international tax strategy. the double irish has kept billions of dollars away from tax collectors around the world and some of it may get clawed back if the european commissions verdict isnt overturned. investors of all stripes should keep an eye on this conflict because the effects will spread far beyond apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

people familiar with the matter recently revealed one of the major enhancements that applenasdaq aapl plans to deliver with its next generation ipad devices. the new ipad hardware will include a faster display technology that allows for smoother zooming panning and scrolling bloomberg reports. although this doesnt appear to tell us much its pretty clear what apple is planning to introduce here a display with a faster refresh rate. a typical display updates or refreshes itself many times in a given second. the displays on most personal computers smartphones and tablets refresh 00NUMBER00 times per second or 00NUMBER00 hertz. however on high end computer displays particularly those targeted at gaming applications that refresh rate can be much higher reaching 00NUMBER00 or even higher. the greater the refresh rate the smoother virtually everything gets. its one of those features that one doesnt realize is missing until one experiences a higher refresh rate display then it becomes quite difficult to go back to displays with slower refresh rates. bloomberg didnt indicate what refresh rate apples next generation ipad displays will run at but my guess is that it will be 00NUMBER00 or double the speed of current ipad displays. it makes sense that apple will debut this technology with the 00NUMBER00 ipad first. a display with a faster refresh rate is likely to be more difficult to build than one with a slower refresh rate meaning that costs could be relatively high and supply might not be all that great. this is certainly a feature that i would expect to come to the iphone at some point. keep in mind however that apple relies on the iphone for the majority of its revenue and gross profit dollars meaning that apple cant introduce the feature until it can be implemented at a reasonable cost structure. also note that the ipad is a much lower volume device than the iphone so building enough panels to meet ipad demand is probably much easier than building enough panels to meet iphone demand. that means it could be a while before apple can bring a faster refresh rate to the iphone. i wouldnt expect it until the 00NUMBER00 iphone at the earliest and it wouldnt be a shocker if iphone customers have to wait until the 00NUMBER00 iphone model to get a zippier display. one of the problems that apple has faced with its ipad product lineup is that to some extent they have been cannibalized by large screen iphones. to combat this trend apple seems to be working to make products into compelling complementary devices. i have to hand it to apple rather than scaling back its efforts on the ipad and going all in on the iphone the company appears to be going full steam ahead with both the iphone andipad. other hardware makers seem to have shifted focus away from their tablet lineups and toward their large screen smartphone offerings as tablet sales have fizzled. over the long term apples tenacity could pay off. even if the tablet market itself doesnt even return to huge growth rates apple may be poised to capture additional share at the high end of the market as other companies simply give up. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the

street junkies tune in for apple inc. s nasdaqaapl annual event. some investors care because aapl stock tends to follow a certain pattern leading up to and immediately following the september reveal. according to yahoo for exampleapple stockhas fallen on the day of the event in the last few years. others care because they see the reveal as indicative of the companys health and prospects. more broadly the hype and press that accompany the event remind us that aapl stock is a special breed. even if you want to argue that apple has lost some shine it has retained a certain level of cult following and obsession. while apple itself is always pretty hush hush about what exactly will be revealed at the event the mystery adding to the hype plenty of aapl followers have been speculating about what we will see. with that in mind lets break down what exactly iphone enthusiasts can expect out of the upcoming apple event. 00NUMBER00 stocks caught in the trump clinton election wariphone 00NUMBER00 star of the sept. 00NUMBER00 event is hands down going to be the iphone 00NUMBER00 aapl experts are all expecting a new iphone and are expecting it to follow the normal naming convention. this is a big deal for investors in apple stock because as ive mentioned many times before aapls slowing upgrade cycle is one of the biggest concerns on the horizon. analyst colin gillis of bgc noted as much writing there is risk that the upgrade rate for the next iphone may slow even more than the upgrade rate cycle of 00NUMBER00. whether the iphone 00NUMBER00 speeds up the upgrade cycle depends in part on what new features the new phone sports. so far most reports suggest a pretty similar form factor compared to the iphone 00NUMBER00. some reports have suggested the new iphone 00NUMBER00 will have a thicker dual lens camera will offer new color choices will have two speaker grills and wont have a headphone jack. also the phone is expected to sport a 00NUMBER00 while the 00NUMBER00 models will no longer be offered. apple watch 00NUMBER00 apple watch doesnt follow a consistent upgrade cycle like the iphone and thus hasnt gotten a refresher since it was first revealed two years ago. thus many expect some much needed improvements will be debuted at the sept. 00NUMBER00 event mostly practical additions like the addition of gps. new macbook prothere is also some speculation that new macbook pros are coming at some point this year but its far from confirmed that they will be announced at the september event. 00NUMBER00 pointed out that this fall event tends to focus heavily on the iphone so aapl may save its new refreshed macbook for later in the year. keep an eye on what is revealed and what press and followers react to when sept. 00NUMBER00 rolls around. apple will be livestreaming the event on iphones ipads and ipod touch devices running ios 00NUMBER00 or later and on apple tv. hilary kramer is the editor of gamechangers  breakout stocks under 00NUMBER00

most valuable company by market cap and as for his anniversary he received a load of shares. hes apparently been quick to cash out his anniversary present as he raked in about 00NUMBER00 million from selling a huge chunk of the shares he received. between august 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 cook sold more than 00NUMBER00 shares of his companys stock at prices ranging between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 per share according to filings with the securities and exchange commission. all of the sales were done under a rule 00NUMBER00 w trading plan which cook adopted on may 00NUMBER00. the share sales also came after a fresh 00NUMBER00 million restricted stock units vested on august 00NUMBER00. after the vesting of the new rsus cook held almost 00NUMBER00 million shares ofapple stock but following all the sales over the last week he now has about 00NUMBER00 million shares. the iphone maker withheld about 00NUMBER00 shares after the rsus vested for tax purposes which left cook with more than 00NUMBER00 million shares of apple stock  after the required tax withholding according to street insider. in other words it means he dumped 00NUMBER00 of his stake in the company over the last week. cook still has plenty of skin the game however as the shares he still holds are worth about 00NUMBER00 million. for the record apple svps daniel riccio and craig federighi also moved some shares of the company around over the last couple of weeks according to regulatory filings. most of cooks income comes in the form of apple stock as his salary was only 00NUMBER00 million last year which is small by silicon valley standards. he may have just wanted to take some profits in light of the fact that most of his income is in stock but one person whos not selling is cnbchost jim cramer. 00NUMBER00 blood in the streets stocks to buy nowthis week he described apples stock chart as the worst in the book but he also said that hes not ready to dump it. he noted before the news about the eu slapping the company with a 00NUMBER00 billion tax bill that the chart technicals suggested that apple stock was about to dive. cramer added that not only does the chart look horrible and the iphone 00NUMBER00 sound very inspiring he still sees plenty of things that could happen for it. investorplacecontributor chris tyler also advisesinvestors to buy on the pullback in apple stock ahead of next weeks iphone 00NUMBER00 unveiling. he pointed out that the stock broke higher than the 00NUMBER00 day simple moving average and down channel resistance level which then created the setup for a nice rally. the shares reversed then but tyler explained today that now a doji decision candle points to a low for a minor correction backed up by the bollinger band and past channel resistance. why

number of shares sold short has fallen sharply since mid may. the stock itself is also on the rise in recent months. this is all happening as were now just four days away from the consumer tech giants unveiling of its new smartphone placing perhaps too much pressure on a device that many industry watchers say will be a modest update as apple saves its iphone upgrade ammo for next years refresh which will coincide with the products 00NUMBER00 anniversary. volatility may be just around the corner. bears are taking to the sidelines. the number of shares of apple sold short peaked at 00NUMBER00 million at the end of may. it has dropped all the way down to 00NUMBER00 million my mid august. it was 00NUMBER00 million a year earlier. one can argue that its right for those betting on a slide inapple stockto bail. shares of apple have now soared 00NUMBER00 since bottoming out in may and theyre up 00NUMBER00 since the end of may when short interest almost poked into nine figures. the rub is that apples fundamentals arent necessarily better now than they were then. the cupertino giant cranked out a horrendous quarterly report. revenue clocked in with a year over year decline for the first time since 00NUMBER00 tosp global market intelligence data. earnings took an even bigger spill. wall street isnt necessarily seeing things through rose gold colored glasses. analysts think apple will earn less for this quarter current fiscal year and next fiscal year than they did three months ago when short interest was nearly twice as substantial. wall streets profit targets for fiscal 00NUMBER00 have gone from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 a share over the past three months. the prospects arent any brighter for the smartphone industry in general and the iphone in particular. apple has now posted back to back quarters of year over year declines in smartphone units and thats problematic since the phone accounts for the lions share of the tech bellwethers business these days. industry tracker idc trimmed its forecast for global shipments in june expecting just 00NUMBER00 in overall growth and the iphones first ever annual decline. its always possible that apple says or does something on wednesday that turns heads making the marketplace think we didnt hit peak iphone sales in 00NUMBER00. we could even see a game changing development outside the iphone. apple is an innovator and these are the situations it lives for. sales may be going the wrong way for the first time in more than 00NUMBER00 years and its biggest product is current losing market share. it may be

00NUMBER00. though a wednesday unveiling for the device is less certain than the closely followed iphone recent purported leaks about a new version of the apple watch support the possibility of a launch and provide some hints about what changes the new version may feature. apple watch. image source apple. little is known about apples next version of its apple watch. while apple teased its newest operating system for the device watchos 00NUMBER00 this summer at apples worldwide developers conference the company didnt specify any features that would be unique to its next version of the watch or even say when a new hardware would be unveiled. in addition apple watch leaks are simply hard to come by since the device ships in much smaller volumes than the iphone. this means the company can more easily keep product leaks under wrap. of course apples sprawling global supply chain makes it nearly impossible for at least some leaks not to slip. and this is what has happened with apple watch 00NUMBER00 just about a week before the devices expected unveiling. as macrumors reportedon sept. 00NUMBER00 a british apple certified accessory and repair reseller for ios devices byte recently posted new photos and a video of what looks to be apple watch 00NUMBER00 parts. based on the photos the device looks as if it will feature thinner display technology and a 00NUMBER00 larger battery than the original apple watch battery. beyond these purported hardware leaks the apple rumor pros over at macrumors expect apple watch 00NUMBER00 to include a gps a faster processor and improved water resistance. but changes to the watchs exterior are unlikely according to macrumors. while the ever active apple rumor mill doesnt seem certain that apple watch will make its debut on wednesday the best reason it could is simply that the device is due for an update. apple ceo tim cook at an apple product event. image source apple. the first version of the apple watch was first unveiled in september 00NUMBER00. deliveries of the device however didnt begin until april last year. this puts apple at well over a year since its last apple watch hardware update a long product cycle for a new apple product. the iphone for instance is consistently refreshed every year and the company even introduced a new lower priced iphonemidway through its annual cycle earlier this year. the apple watch serves an interesting role in apples business. probably accounting for about 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue the device wont do much either way for apples overall business. but that doesnt mean investors should forget about the segment. investors are looking to see whether the company can grow its newest product category to meaningful levels in the same way it did with the ipad which now represents 00NUMBER00 of the companys total revenue. if apple watch sales or at least a broader wearable segment if apple chooses to launch more wearable technology in the future can grow to around 00NUMBER00 or more of revenue the new category could both help apple grow its business and diversify its hardware offerings. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech

event is almost here. the company has an event scheduled on wednesdaywhere it is expected unveil its iphone 00NUMBER00. while the iphone will almost undoubtedly be the main focus of the event the tech giant may give one of its newer brands some love too. one rumor points to an unveiling of new beats by dre products. beats headphones. image source beats. apples plans to unveil new beats products at the event were discovered by igeneration via macrumors in an email accidentally sent by beats public relations team. after posting a screenshot of the email igeneration was quickly asked to remove it reports macrumors juli clover. while the email didnt specify which beats products would be unveiled at the event they are likely to be headphones. not only is beats primarily a headphone company but apple has incentive to launch new headphones if rumors about the company ditching the headphone jackwith iphone 00NUMBER00 really are true. speculation about apple eliminating the headphone jack on iphone 00NUMBER00 also suggests the company plans for headphones to connect either wirelessly or with the iphones lightning connector. since apple owns beats apple presumably plans to update its beats headphones to work with a lightning connector. interestingly however if igeneration is right about apple planning to debut new beats products at the event any new headphones deserving of meaningful time during the companys keynote will likely include more than a simple change to the adapter. perhaps new beats headphones will feature a design overhaul. if apple does overhaul its beats headphones the move could be the first major update for the headphone lineup since the tech giant acquired beats in 00NUMBER00. while beats headphones have evolved during the past few years the changes have arguably only been incremental. its worth noting that if apple does give its beats headphones a major update it could help the company demonstrate why eliminating the headphone jack makes sense. apple wouldnt be the first company to highlight the advantages of lightning connected headsets cirrus logic recently announced a headset development kit for lightning based audio accessories arguing the technology enables high fidelity audio and better interaction with ios apps for custom audio experiences. beats headphones. image source beats. of course its also possible that new beats headphones will be mentioned during the keynote but only briefly. with the limited information igeneration received this is definitely possible. and if this is the case changes to the headphones may only be incremental. new beats headphones might be more important than investors think at least in the near term. sure beats products likely only represent a sliver of apples revenue beats products along with apple tv apple watch ipod and apple branded and third party accessories all fall under the companys other products segment which account for just 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue. but apples move to ditch the headphone jack could spark a surge in orders for new compatible beats headphones. still it would be nothing more than speculation to predict beats headphones will become meaningful to the companys business. chances are they will remain mostly unimportant to operating results. and even if there is a surge in beats headphone sales after the launch of an iphone 00NUMBER00 higher demand likely wont be sustainable as other headphone makers will probably quickly make their own lightning based headphones. ultimately of course where apple needs to shine is the iphone itself. at about 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months its the primary driver of the companys business. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot

for applenasdaq aapl. the consumer tech giant will introduce the iphone 00NUMBER00 hoping that its a compelling enough update to inspire a fresh wave of upgrades. digitimes is hearingfrom taiwanese iphone supply chain sources that apple has recently revised its orders for parts higher by 00NUMBER00. that is an encouraging development but its important to frame that uptick in perceived initial demand correctly. the same digitimes report also points out that apple was originally targeting to ship just 00NUMBER00 as many iphones during the latter half of the 00NUMBER00 calendar year as it did a year earlier. there is clearly a lot riding on this device as the iphone continues to account for the lions share of apples business these days. anything that suggests strong smartphone sales out of apple this cycle is a bonus especially since more company watchers have pointed to next years update 00NUMBER00 years after the original iphone hit the market as the update that could be a game changer. however apple has a history of surprising the market when it least expects it. that could happen tomorrow but it may also want to be careful about not making its shiny new iphone too much of an improvement. the same chatter of new features has been swirling in recent weeks. the most controversial tweak is that tomorrows debutante wont have a headphone jack. owners will reportedly have to settle for earbuds that plug directly into the charging port or pay up for bluetooth headsets. other oft rumored features include the elimination of a home button in favor of haptic feedback sensors more storage capacity and a dual lens camera that can take enhanced snapshots and videos. everyone seems to agree that it will have the same form factor as the current model. the specs may impress the market especially at a time when the consensus appears to be that apple will be pardon the pun phoning it in as it saves dry upgrade powder for next summers milestone. however even some of these seemingly rumored updates could pose near term financial challenges for apple. lets take the talk about tomorrows iphone 00NUMBER00 being more water resistant than previous models. that will come as a great relief to anyone that has dropped a smartphone in the toilet or accidentally kept it in a swimsuit pocket while entering a swimming pool but isnt that also a problem water damage ruins a lot of iphones but that also finds those same people scrambling to buy replacement devices. then we get to claims of beefed up capacity. most reports are suggesting that all three options will be increased peaking at 00NUMBER00 gigs of internal storage. that is twice as much as todays model. thats great in theory but will too much capacity eat into folks paying a premium for icloud storage plans apples icloud platform offers just five gigs of free storage and subscriptions start at 00NUMBER00 a month for 00NUMBER00 gigabytes. the merits of having a cloud based bank to back things up are clear but a lot of iphone users turn to the cloud to free up space on their devices. that may become less necessary with 00NUMBER00 gigs of storage in your hand. the bullish counters are obvious. eliminating the headphone jack will beef up sales of headphones including those put out by apple owned beats. more capacity will give iphone owners the flexibility to go crazy on itunes and app store purchases. these are important considerations naturally but lets not assume that all iphone 00NUMBER00 advantages will be benefits to apples top and bottom line. things are never that easy. a secret billion dollar

since deliveries of the device started apple is reportedly ready to introduce its second version of the wearable device. little is known about a possible second generation apple watch. rare rumors and leaks boil down to thinner display technology a larger battery a barometer and a gps. despite 00NUMBER00 rumors suggesting apple watch 00NUMBER00 would include a facetime camera and expanded wi fi capabilities its looking less likely these features will debut this year no recent leaks or reports have surfaced suggesting these features are coming to the newest version of apple watch. beatsa recent email sent accidentally by beats public relations team to igeneration says apple will unveil a selection of new beats by dre productsat the event. in light of speculation about apple ditching the headphone jack on the iphone 00NUMBER00 in favor of lightning based and wireless headphones it makes sense apples 00NUMBER00 acquired headphone company beats is ready to unveil new products on wednesday. interestingly the fact that new beats products may get some keynote time suggests the new hardware could represent a significant improvement over previous models rather than a small incremental update to the adapter. in addition to announcing new products apple should follow its typical annual routine of providing the release dates for its latest software. ios 00NUMBER00 preview. youtube video posted by apples official youtube channel. teased at apples software focused worldwide developers conference this summer apple is expected to announce release dates for ios 00NUMBER00 macos sierra tvos 00NUMBER00 and watchos 00NUMBER00. if the releases are scheduled in a similar manner as they were last year the latest versions of ios and watchos should go live around the middle of september and macos sierra may get its official start toward the end of the month. its more difficult to predict when apple may make a tvos 00NUMBER00 update live but the companys website currently says coming soon. the event comes at an important time for apple. the company has reported two quarters in a row of year over year declines in revenue and guided for another year over year decline in the current quarter which ends at the end of this month. investors may be hoping some of apples announcements on wednesday will help reverse this negative revenue trend. investors can tune into apples

some investors may have will the tech giants next iphone sport the gusto needed to reverse the segments declining revenue apples new iphone unveiling this week may not directly answer this question but it could or could not be enough to give investors hope. apples iphone segment has been under the magnifying glass recently. two quarters of declining iphone revenue have investors wondering if the segment has peaked. data retrieved from apple sec filings for quarters shown. chart source author. to be fair the huge success of iphone 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00 has made year over year comparisons incredibly tough. investors therefore should maintain perspective iphone sales are still higher than they were two years ago highlighting continued health in the segment. but its iphones growth potential from here thats in question. its easy to see why a decline in revenue for apples iphone segment could be concerning. iphone is without a doubt the companys most important product. in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months iphone accounted for a whopping 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue leaving the companys other segments far behind. tied for second and third place at 00NUMBER00 of revenue is mac and services. ipad comes in third at 00NUMBER00. and apples other segment which includes sales of apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and apple branded and third party accessories according to the companys third quarter unaudited summary data only accounts for 00NUMBER00 of revenue. another reason iphone 00NUMBER00 will be so interesting is because for the first time its launch follows a mid cycle introduction of a lower cost iphone the iphone se. with a starting price of 00NUMBER00 well below the typical 00NUMBER00 starting price for apples flagship lineup some investors may be wondering if the cheaper iphone will cannibalize sales of the rumored iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. if speculation about the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which are expected to launch on wednesday is correct there doesnt seem to be any new must have features on the device doing little to soothe any concerns about declining iphone sales. apple september 00NUMBER00 event invitation art. image source apple. indeed iphone 00NUMBER00 is expected to mostly sport the same form factor as both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 making this the third iphone with the same outer design. the ever active apple rumor mill anticipates redesigned antenna lines a flush home button the elimination of the 00NUMBER00 headphone jack and a new glossy black option. expected internal upgrades are more notable but not game changing. rumors point to a faster processor improved camera more ram higher storage options and better water resistance. while there may be some surprises when the new iphone is actually unveiled available information may have investors doubting the new device can solicit the monster upgrade cycle needed for the segment to return to iphone 00NUMBER00 sales levels. fortunately expectations for apples iphone segment are low. this is particularly evident by the stocks price to earnings ratio of under just 00NUMBER00 at the time of this writing. the stock simply isnt priced for iphone to return to growth. but if iphone 00NUMBER00 can drive a bigger than expected upgrade cycle apple shareholders may do well over the next year.

image source apple. form factor driven costs how might keeping the iphone 00NUMBER00 form factor around another year help apples gross profit margin a brief look at apples gross profit margin history when the company launched its iphone 00NUMBER00 provides some clues. apple investors following the tech giant closely when the company launched iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 may recall discussions of costs driven by new form factors in earnings calls following the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch. the iphone 00NUMBER00 new form factor simply cost more to manufacturer than its predecessor. the higher cost was driven by a significantly different form factor than the iphone 00NUMBER00 that came before it. notably the iphone 00NUMBER00 display size jumped from 00NUMBER00 inches to 00NUMBER00 and included a retina display with more pixels. in addition the iphone 00NUMBER00 body adopted an anodized aluminum back and diamond cut chamfered edges. higher costs for the iphone 00NUMBER00 of course ended up negatively affecting apples gross profit. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source the motley fool. apples cfo at the time of the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch peter oppenheimer explained in the companys fiscal 00NUMBER00 fourth quarter earnings call how new products particularly those with new form factors start out production with heightened cost curves and ultimately mean a narrower profit marginas you pointed out this is the most prolific product period in apples history. we have an unprecedented number of new product introductions over the last six weeks and this has led to record levels of demand. new or repriced versions of our products announced during this time frame represent over 00NUMBER00 of the total expected december quarter revenue. but there are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand. the iphone 00NUMBER00 ipad mini imac macbook pro 00NUMBER00 inch ipod touch and ipod nano have completely new form factors with great new features and weve never before introduced so many new form factors at once. all of these products have higher costs than their predecessors and therefore lower gross margins as they are at the height of the cost curve. this has been the case with new products in the past so nothing new. the difference this time is the sheer number of new products we are introducing in a very short period of time. sure enough apples gross profit margin in the quarter following this discussion was 00NUMBER00 down significantly from its gross profit margin of 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. the negative impact radically redesigned products were having on apples business was unmistakable. with these lessons in mind theres a possibility apple could benefit from the opposite scenario in which its product form factors are generally remaining the same for a longer than usual timeframe. in other words keeping the iphone 00NUMBER00 form factor for yet another year could potentially mean apples margin on the device will compare favorably than the margin on its flagship iphone in the year ago quarter. while further per unit iphone cost reductions could be minor since apple may have realized the bulk of them during the form factors second year iphone 00NUMBER00 gross margin history suggests a margin tailwind is likely if the iphone 00NUMBER00 truly keeps the iphone 00NUMBER00 form factor. and even if per unit iphone cost cant be improved any further keeping the same form factor at least means apple can milk a 00NUMBER00 introduced iphone design for another year before the devices cost curve jumps again when the form factor finally gets overhauled. of course this all assumes the iphone 00NUMBER00 announced on wednesday really does generally keep the same form factor as iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. a secret

contrary to a report from nikkei asian review. given the lack of practical value and given apples proclivity to adopt its own unique look and feel i dont see any motivation whatsoever for apple to buy curved amoled displays hibben writes. though i respect hibbens view i dont agree. heres why. samsungs galaxy 00NUMBER00 was reportedly a disappointment in the marketplace. in fact the wall street journalreported back in late 00NUMBER00 that sales of the 00NUMBER00 came in a whopping 00NUMBER00 below expectations. however things seemingly began to turn around for samsungs mobile group with the launch of the galaxy 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 was fairly well received and in particular the variant with a curved display seemed to catch consumers attention. then earlier this year samsung released two variants of the galaxy 00NUMBER00 the vanilla model with a flat panel display and the edge model with a curved display. samsung said in its most recent earnings release that it enjoyed an improvement in its product mix because of increased portion of edge in 00NUMBER00. customers clearly find value in the curved displays on samsungs phones. in fact samsungs renewed success in the premium portion of the smartphone market comes at a time when apple is struggling to get its iphone business back on a growth path. coincidence i dont think so. at the end of the day its apples job to produce compelling and competitive products. if customers are attracted to the curved displays found on samsungs latest phones then i see little choice on apples part but to adopt a similar technology in future iphones. the good news for apple is that its very likely that management recognizes this competitive deficiency relative to samsung and the other smartphone vendors that are adopting samsungs curved displays and will engineer future products to eliminate that deficiency. perhaps the bigger issue for apple is that it seems to be very poor at predicting trends in display technology and size trends. the company was woefully late to bringing out phones with larger screen displays its late to transitioning to oled displays and now its behind the curve in a transition to curved oled displays. apple will eventually catch up and once it does it should be able to regain some lost business in a similar fashion as to what happened when the company finally launched the large screen iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus devices. however if the idevice maker wants to avoid being put in a position where it is losing market share to competitors it needs to invest more aggressively in future display technology development. that said though apple is hardly perfect the company does seem to be able to learn from its mistakes. i wouldnt be surprised to find out that apple has indeed been investing much more heavily in display technology to ensure that in the future its a leader in this area and not just a not that fast follower. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the

apple fans everywhere when it announced that the new iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus devices would not include the industry standard 00NUMBER00 headphone jack. instead of the familiar headphone plug iphone 00NUMBER00 users will connect to the phones lightning port which is also used for charging the device. apple will include a pair of earpods with a lightning connector as well as an adapter for analog headphones with every purchase of its latest phones. as if we werent already confused enough by apples decision the companys marketing chief phil schiller left us scratching our heads when he attempted to explain apples rationale for moving away from the standard headphone jack. the reason to move on courage. the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us said schiller onstage. excuse me for my cynicism but i dont quite see how apples new headphones will better us all. in fact the decision reeks as an attempt to force users towards the companys own accessories instead of buying third party headphones. along with the new lightning based headphones that will come with the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple announced its new airpods today. with a similar design to its iconic earpods minus the cords apples airpods are wireless in ear headphones that are equipped with infrared sensors and will only play when they detect that they are in a users ear.

for the next iphone so we shouldnt bother with this event or so they thought. then the event started and the naysayers were proved wrong once again. though the event largely centered around improvements made towards the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus the surprise announcement of the day belonged to nintendo. in addition to super mario stickers coming for messages the japanese gaming company announced it will be bringing super mario to the app store in a new game super mario run coming later this year. with the success of pokemon go more than 00NUMBER00 million downloads to date this is sure to help apple and nintendo as well grow app store revenue. the app store has been mentioned repeatedly by ceo tim cook and team helping grow the companys service revenues a key highlight as smartphone sales inevitably slow down. during the presentation cook mentioned more than 00NUMBER00 billion apps have been downloaded to date and the growth rate seems to be accelerating over the past two months apple has seen 00NUMBER00 year over year growth rates remarkable when you consider many have said the app download boom is over. though mario was largely the star of the show and a star in my heart the iphone managed to garner significant attention especially its camera improvements. now that over 00NUMBER00 billion iphones have been sold with cook calling it the â€œbest selling product of its kind in history of the world minor upgrades to the internal parts are what primarily drive sales. coming in new colors jet black with a stainless steel apple logo black as well as the traditional gold silver and rose gold say bye felicia to space grey the iphone 00NUMBER00 has a completely redesigned camera system one that may wind up taking on more expensive dslr cameras. it boasts an optical image stabilizer a wider 00NUMBER00 aperture lens a 00NUMBER00 mp sensor thats faster and more energy efficient the ability to detect and compensate for lighting that flickers and an image sensor processor that uses machine learning to generate better photos. couple that with the 00NUMBER00 mp facetime hd camera on the front and all of this means that this is the best camera youve seen on a smartphone and then some. if that werent enough the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is basically getting a 00NUMBER00 camera showing real time deep depth preview on screens optical zoom at one or two times with a button and ten times via software. andreessen horowitz analyst ben evans postulated apple may be getting closer to virtual reality with these latest advancements. these upgrades plus the better battery life new headphones stereo speakers 00NUMBER00 chip and a starting size of 00NUMBER00 are all likely to drive iphone sales in the interim especially the holiday quarter. the new airpods 00NUMBER00 new beats 00NUMBER00 wireless headphones beats x wireless and the higher memory sizes 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 up from 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 are likely to help keep margins high something thats important for apple investors. so much for being boring and mundane huhthe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. tim cook has only been at applesnasdaq aapl helm for five years but during that time hes offered some snippets of advice on leadership and apples future. we can probably all glean something from his thoughts considering theyre coming from the ceo of the most valuable company in the world. here are just a few tim cook quotes you shouldnt miss. cook built his apple career on managing the companys sales and operations positions that are knee deep in cold hard numbers. but when it comes to life and leading cook says intuition is the most important thing to consider. cook addressed his alma mater in 00NUMBER00 telling auburn university graduatesbut there are times in our lives when the careful consideration of cost and benefits just doesnt seem like the right way to make a decision. there are times in all of our lives when a reliance on gut or intuition just seems more appropriate when a particular course of action just feels right. and interestingly ive discovered its in facing lifes most important decisions that intuition seems the most indispensable to getting it right. cooks shared his style of leadership with dukes fuqua school of business in 00NUMBER00 when he said he looks to bring people around him that can analyze different view points and who are constantly excited about their work. he said in an interview at the schoolyou look for wicked smart people. you look for people who appreciate different points of view. people who care enough that they have an idea at 00NUMBER00 at night and they want to call and talk to you about it. because theyre so excited about it they want to push the idea further. and that they believe that somebody can help them push the idea another step instead of them doing everything themselves. of course apples ceo has his own ideas about where technology is going and how his company will benefit. speaking about smartphones and their evolution into artificially intelligent devices cook told the washington post recentlythatlook at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future like ai. ai will make this product even more essential to you. it will become even a better assistant than it is today. so where you probably arent leaving home without it today youre really going to be connected to it in the future. that may be good news for the future of apple which is so closely tied to its iphones sales. the companys smartphone sales have been slipping lately but cook has stuck to a long standing apple philosophy of not focusing on the numbers. speaking to fast company last year cook saidtheres this thing in technology almost a disease where the definition of success is making the most. how many clicks did you get how many active users do you have how many units did you sell everybody in technology seems to want big numbers. steve never got carried away with that. he focused on making the best. this approach has left some investors nervous at times when it appears apple isnt doing enough to boost sales or introduce new products. but cook has remained resilient in his approach to apples future device iterations. cook said in that same interviewwe werent first on the 00NUMBER00 player we werent first on the tablet we werent first on the smartphone. but we were arguably the first modern smartphone and we will be the first modern smartwatch the first one that matters. cooks comments at least for smartwatches have proved true so far. the apple watch is currently the best stelling smartwatchon the market by far. with many years likely ahead for apples current ceo we can expect to glean much more advice from cooks quotes in the future. but his thoughts are already shedding some light on how cook approaches leadership and how hell continue to run apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show

applenasdaq aapl has taken the opportunity to brag about how well the iphone sold during its launch weekend. this figure has been steadily climbing over the years as apple released its latest and greatest every year. yearmodellaunch weekend 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 milliondata source apple. well it looks like the mac maker is calling it quits with these disclosures. in a statement to various media outlets including reuters apple says it will stop sharing launch weekend sales this year. the company says that launch weekend sales are not a good indication of demand as iphones at launch are supply constrained. in other words the metric only measures supply and not demand and as such is not particularly useful for investors anymore. these initial sales will be governed by supply not demand and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers according to apple spokeswoman kristin huguet. the thing is that iphone sales have longbeen supply constrained at launch but that has never stopped apple from sharing the data before. so the companys rationale for discontinuing the disclosure seems a little weak. most years there is some crucial component that creates some bottleneck within apples supply chain that limits production and shipping times on new models typically slip pretty quickly. its probably not a coincidence that iphone unit sales have seemingly peaked with apple expectedly putting up its second decline in unit sales last quarter. instead what may really be happening here is that apple expects the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch weekend sales to be less than or equal to last years figure in which case it already knows ahead of time that it doesnt want to share a number unless its larger. this all plays into a broader storyline thats been happening over the past year or so. apple has been trying very hard to shift the narrative away from quarterly unit sales and toward recurring revenue sources like services and digital content purchases. what better way to accomplish that goal than to share less data around unit salesa secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

morning trading thursday following the relatively poor public reaction to its latest keynote event on wednesday. although the tech giants latest mobile phone has yet to even begin shipping consumers everywhere are furious over the companys decision to remove one key feature from the device. in front of a packed crowd at the bill graham civic auditorium in san francisco apple unveiled a variety of new products and services including the iphone 00NUMBER00. while the new iphone boasts new colors water and dust resistance and improved camera capabilities people are upset about the companys decision to remove the industry standard 00NUMBER00 headphone jack. also read heres everything we learned from todays apple eventinstead of the familiar headphone plug iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00

with every purchase of its latest generation of phones. also read apple claims it took courage to remove headphone jackthis is clearly a big change in the industry and as big changes oftentimes go people arent immediately excited about it. people also seem frustrated with apples new wireless headphone option the airpods which will retail for around 00NUMBER00. since the announcement yesterday the internet has been in an uproar about apples decision. here are just a few of our favorite reactions on twitteraaplspends billions and billions on rd yet has introduced nothing new for years and new iphones have nothing exciting. snoreyawnwhen you try too hard to be different forward 00NUMBER00 wireless headphones will be lost within the first month. me what about a screen that doesnt crack

links applefbswitching back to android why would i want an adapter to plug in my headphones what if im charging and want to listen to music. appleits probably fair to say that apples decision was at least partially motivated by the desire to move users away from third party accessories and while i doubt that apple designed any product specifically to be lost or broken it cant be denied that the company will benefit from repeat sales. so what do you think about the new iphone 00NUMBER00 and the airpods let us know by joining the conversation at zacksresearch onstocktwitsandtwitter. want the

rumor mill today is news of the ios 00NUMBER00 golden master public beta being released. today well look at that and other apple rumorsfor wednesday. ios 00NUMBER00 golden master apple has released the ios 00NUMBER00 golden master of its public beta to testers reports macrumors. this release comes just a couple of days after developers received their own version of the ios 00NUMBER00 golden master. the update can be downloaded over the air using the software update feature. the golden master version of ios 00NUMBER00 is the final version that will be released to normal users on sept. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. the previous version of the ios 00NUMBER00 public beta was released about two weeks ago. jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 apple fans that are interested in buying the new jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 should be mindful of a few things bgrnotes. the first thing to note is that the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 will wont include a 00NUMBER00 version for either the iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 plus. its also important to remember that the glossy finish on the device means that it will be easier to scratch than the other colors. aapl itself has pointed out the issue on its website and warns users that they might want to look into a case for the smartphone. however this would kind of defeat the purpose of buying the newest color it offers for the iphone line. listening to music while charging the iphone 00NUMBER00 listening to music while charging the iphone 00NUMBER00 will be more difficult than it should be reports 00NUMBER00. owners of the iphone 00NUMBER00 will have two options when listening to music and charging the smartphone. these are the new bluetooth airpods and the apple lightning dock. the airpods will set customers back 00NUMBER00 but other bluetooth headphones could be used as well. the lightning dock costs 00NUMBER00 and includes a 00NUMBER00 headphone jack. however its not really portable which limits its uses. the post thursday apple rumors

nasdaq inc.  iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. applesnasdaq aapl new iphone 00NUMBER00 is here and its looking good. here are four reasons the device stands out from its predecessors. as silly as it may seem new color options really do serve as key selling points for apples iphone launches. this was particularly the case of the white iphone 00NUMBER00 and the gold iphone 00NUMBER00. both turned out to be very popular and arguably played a meaningful role in driving sales. for iphone 00NUMBER00 apple introduced two new colors black and jet back and eliminated its space gray option. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. the two new black colors are well received in initial reviews of the device. famed video tech reviewer marques brownlee capturedoverall enthusiasm for the new black optionthe black is this purely all black matte look. and i gotta say this feels really good and looks good in person. . . im gonna be grabbing that matte black. something about stealth look just speaks to me. iphone 00NUMBER00 can be submerged one meter deep in water for 00NUMBER00 minutes. water resistance is a particularly important selling point as samsungheavily promotes the water resistance of its newest flagship phones. both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sport a 00NUMBER00 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization and an improved aperture and lens for brighter more detailed photos and videos. but the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus also has a 00NUMBER00 megapixel telephoto camera giving the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the ability for optical zoom at two times. the new iphone is blazing fast. a new custom designed apple 00NUMBER00 fusion chip sets the golden standard for smartphone processors continuing to highlight apples growing lead over competition when it comes to performance. as if the iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 jump in processing speed compared to the 00NUMBER00 before it wasnt good enough the new 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 faster than the 00NUMBER00 or twice as fast as the 00NUMBER00 in the iphone 00NUMBER00. importantly this jump in performance wont take a hit on battery life. indeed the opposite is the case. its unique quad core technology integrates two high performance cores and two high efficiency cores capable of running one fifth the power of the high performance cores. this all new architecture enables faster processing when its needed and the ability to use less power when possible making for two more hours of battery life on the iphone 00NUMBER00 compared to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and one more hour on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus compared to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. image source apple. of course these arent the only new features of the iphone 00NUMBER00. other notable upgrades include a wide color system on the display dust resistance the first stereo speakers in an iphone and a redesigned home button. but its likely the iphone 00NUMBER00 new colors water resistance and improved camera and processor that will drive sales. iphone 00NUMBER00 may not represent a major overhaul to the lineup but its new features and improvements certainly look compelling enough to help apple continue to generate far more profits from its smartphones than any of its competition. more importantly for investors the iphone 00NUMBER00 looks poised to continue to justify the stocks conservative valuation. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat

the company focused primarily on just two products the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the apple watch series 00NUMBER00. while the iphone was the clear headliner the opening act was notable in what was missing. the new series 00NUMBER00 of the apple watch edition now features a white ceramic case while the original gold case is no more. the shift from gold to ceramic is telling as it suggests that apples efforts to sell smartwatches that cost 00NUMBER00 or more have been relatively unsuccessful. the new ceramic model starts at 00NUMBER00 about the price of a new mac and apple says it is four times as hard as stainless steel. thats a pretty big change in pricing strategy. presumably the market for 00NUMBER00 smartwatches that become technologically outdated in short order is pretty small. say hello to the ceramic apple watch edition series 00NUMBER00. image source apple. originally i thought the high price point of the edition would offset low unit volumes not that apple has ever shared detailed financial results around its nascent smartwatch business. the most obvious impact is that average selling prices will decline but apple will also modestly reduce its exposure to the volatileprice of gold. incidentally apple recovered approximately 00NUMBER00 million worth of gold through its recycling program last year. you can think of the original gold edition as an experiment testing the waters of high fashion. it took quite a bit of courage even to try such an ambitious pricing strategy and no other original equipment manufacturer attempted to go quite as high. the move to ceramic will probably be well received as it rationalizes the product line in a compelling way particularly as series 00NUMBER00 includes various other performance improvements. but that was always the rub. people know that tech gadgets depreciate quickly as performance gets better with new versions and 00NUMBER00 is a lot to ask for a product that you know will suffer such a fate. a secret

nasdaq inc.  image source apple. after a not so successful iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle applenasdaq aapl needed to release a pair of compelling smartphones with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. there were numerous reports in the press ahead of the launch that suggested that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus wouldnt be all that interesting. well the new phones are here. although the phones might not be a radical departure from the prior generation models apple appears to have done a really good job in delivering a lot of improvements in areas that really count. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was a bit of a mixed bag in terms of competitive positioning. it easily had the most robust processor of any of its contemporaries and this now only gets better with the 00NUMBER00 fusion and the 00NUMBER00 touch feature was unique and innovative although apparently not really all that appreciated given that apple saw a year over year sales decline during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. however the iphone 00NUMBER00 family of phones werent quite leading the pack in terms of display technology and perhaps most surprisingly given its historical positioning here camera technology. with all of the enhancements that apple says its brought to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and in particular the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cameras both front facing and rear facing it seems reasonable to expect that apple has remedied any competitive deficiencies with respect to the camera subsystems though well have to wait for third party tests to verify that hypothesis. as far as the displays go apple says its made two major improvements support for the wider dci 00NUMBER00 color gamut and significantly improved brightness. according to the specifications page for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the contrast ratios on the displays remain the same as the ones found on the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 smartphone families. well have to see how the new iphones stack up in terms of display performance but i suspect that phil schillers apples senior vice president of worldwide marketing  claim that the displays on these phones are the best displays on any smartphone might not hold up to objective scrutiny. however i do think apples competitive positioning improves in this area so thats a plus. in addition to an improved competitive positioning the new iphones get better in other ways that should make them more attractive both to potential non iphone users looking to jump ship as well as to users of current iphones that apple is trying to get to upgrade. apple has finally done away with the space grey color and has instead replaced it with a black color as well as with a cool jet black phone. although the color of the device might seem like a trivial thing its probably more important than you might think. the new colors and generally improved aesthetic theres no more antenna lines running straight across the backs of these new phones could help demand. perhaps more importantly though apple is touting improved battery lives on these new devices relative to the prior generation iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the company claims that iphone 00NUMBER00 delivers a two hour battery life improvement over the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus lasts a full hour longer than the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. better battery life is hardly a whiz bang feature but its of genuine practical use. if third party reviews verify that apples battery life claims hold up then this could not only serve to compel users of older iphones to upgrade but it could get users of other phones who have desired iphones but wanted better battery life to move over too. all told the new phones represent a solid if straightforward smartphone release from apple. there arent any earth shattering improvements at least as far as the typical customer is concerned the engineering that went into the 00NUMBER00 fusion chip is nothing short of breathtaking to this chip geek but these look

nasdaq inc.  image source wikimedia foundationthough hes certainly not without his detractors applenasdaq aapl co founder and former ceo steve jobs would appear on many peoples lists of the worlds all time great business leaders. and as investors we can learn invaluable lessons from those iconic individuals. fortunately for us jobs wasnt shy about sharing his musings on life technology work and much more. here a just a handful of steve jobs top quotes. perhaps more than anything else under jobs guidance apple became famous for its obsession for building the best products possible. if fact jobs often disregarded market research on consumer preferences trying to push the envelope beyond what consumers thought possible. heres how jobs summarized his thinking on product design and its relations to business strategya lot of companies have chosen to downsize and maybe that was the right thing for them. we chose a different path. our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers they would continue to open their wallets. however apples brilliance under jobs extended beyond designing great products. he was also one of the most adept and shrewd marketers. his vision for and ability to project apples brand in creative ways to consumers is why apple ranks as the worlds most valuable brand. though long the following quote from jobs about apples think different campaign beautifully captures his philosophy on marketing. to me marketing is about values. this is a very complicated world. this is a very noisy world and were not going to get a chance to get people to remember much about us. no company is. and so we have to be really clear on what we want them to know about us. . . . the way to do that is not to talk about speeds and feeds. its not to talk about bits and megahertz. its not to talk about why were better than windows. one of the greatest examples of marketing the world has ever seen is nike. remember nike sells a commodity they sell shoes. and yet when you think of nike you feel something different than a shoe company. in their ads. . . they dont ever talk about the product. they dont ever tell you about their air soles and why theyre better than reeboks air soles. what does nike do for their advertisements they honor great athletes and they honor great athletics. thats who they are. thats what theyre about. apple at the core its core value is that we believe that people with passion can change the world for the better. a lot of things have changed. the markets a totally different place than it was a decade ago and apples totally different and apples place in it is totally different. . . . and we understand that. but values and core values those things shouldnt change. the things that apple believed in at its core are the same things that apple really stands for today. though he borrowed from the work of others  jobs helped usher several technological revolutions into the mainstream. one of the defining characteristics of apples approach to technology has been its commitment to an integrated hardware software product strategy. this preference ensured apple would lose the pc war to ibmclones running microsofts operating systems but its also what allows apple to capture nearly all of the profits from the smartphone market today. for better or worse its easy to tell where this strong preference originatedive always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do. however apples competitive advantages extend beyond technology. jobs attracted a deep bench of talent across software engineering hardware engineering operations design and more. being able to lure and motivate the best of the best became a self sustaining advantage for apple and thats something that jobs appreciatedinnovation has nothing to do with how many rd dollars you have. when apple came up with the mac ibm was spending at least 00NUMBER00 times more on rd. its not about money. its about the people you have how youre led and how much you get it. jobs perspective resonates with people because of its emotional slant. regardless of your opinion of him and he was both complex and imperfect its undeniable that jobs viewed his work at apple on a personal level. no quote that i know of better captures that this sentiment better than a passage from his 00NUMBER00 commencement address at stanford universityyouve got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do. if you havent found it yet keep looking and dont settle. as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it. however this merely scratches the surface of his perspective toward life and work. heres an older quote from jobs that echoes the same strain of optimismso the thing i would say is. . . when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world and to try to not to bash into any of the walls too much to try to have a nice family life have fun save a little money. . . thats a very limited life. life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence it you can build your own things that other people can use. . . once you learn that youll never be the same again. though he could be ruthless  or petty about certain financial matters  jobs public commentary generally framed business pursuits as a pathway to achieving meaning in life. even after he became a billionaire he still appeared far more motivated by the personal impact of his work than the financial windfalls it produced. this quote speaks to where his priorities laymy favorite things in life dont cost any money. its really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time. lists of great steve jobs quotes can go on indefinitely. however the sampling above nicely encapsulates the qualities of apples late leader. and given his enduring popularity his words and thinking on business and life will remain relevant well into the future. so as the man himself famously quoted stay hungry. stay foolish with a very intentional capital f. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss

it announced that its latest generation of phones the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus would not feature the industry standard 00NUMBER00 headphone jack. nevertheless apples keynote on wednesday didnt just focus on the iphone and among other things the company shared some surprising information about the growth of apple music. apple ceo tim cook started the event by flaunting apple musics impressive growth the relatively young music streaming service already has 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers after launching in june of 00NUMBER00. for comparison industry leading spotify has about 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers after eight years. also read which music streaming service is the best right nowhow is it that apple music has been able to outpace the rest of the music streaming industry look no further than the explanation cook himself offered onstage this weekapple music is the premiere destination for new artists and existing artists to launch their exclusive music cook boasted. setting aside any opinions on the practice of artists releasing their music exclusively on one platform cook is absolutely correct. apple has made a habit of signing the worlds biggest artists to deals that see their newest music remain exclusive on apple music until two weeks after the original release date. are you a big fan of drake taylor swift frank ocean future or dr. dre youll be needing an apple music subscription to keep up with their newest music. just take a look at the billboard top 00NUMBER00 albumslist right now. the number two album this week is florida georgia lines dig your roots which is only available to stream on apple music. last weeks number one album frank oceans long awaited blonde just debuted on spotify after remaining an apple music exclusive for weeks. shooting up the charts is travis scotts sophomore album birds in the trap sing mcknight another apple music exclusive. based purely on music apple music genuinely feels like the best option for users. spotify does not do exclusive releases and although tidal has deals with kanye west beyoncé and rihanna its overall library is limited. apple music is currently adding about one million subscribers a month thanks to its exclusive release strategy. thats definitely some good news in the face of the backlash from the removal of the headphone jack. for more coverage on apples

known as the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus respectively. the new phones represent a solid step forward for the iphone series delivering enhanced performance and features as well as a more refined aesthetic. the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones come in three storage tiers with the cheapest variant a version with 00NUMBER00 gb of flash memory starting at 00NUMBER00. from there it costs 00NUMBER00 to move up each tier. this is the same pricing structure that apple has employed with its iphones for quite a while now. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus however begins at 00NUMBER00 for the base model with 00NUMBER00 gb of storage and like the smaller iphone 00NUMBER00 series costs buyers an additional 00NUMBER00 per storage tier. this represents a slight premium over what the idevice maker had charged for previous large iphone models. what does this mean for apple lets take a closer look. it doesnt seem as though the additional 00NUMBER00 is going to impact demand all that much. relative to the pricing of prior generation base models this is less than a 00NUMBER00 price hike. for the higher end models the price increase is an even smaller increase with the price hike working out to just over 00NUMBER00 for the highest tier version. additionally a 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 price hike particularly given the scope of the hardware improvements and the bump in storage across all of the tiers 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gb has now become 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 gb can be very easily justified. so i dont think that the slight price increase will have any meaningful negative impact on demand. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cycle had driven continued growth the idevice maker it would be tempting to chalk up the price hike to apple simply wanting to improve gross profit margins and ultimately wring out additional profitability from these new higher end phones. however in light of the fact that the older iphone 00NUMBER00 plus didntdo that well i doubt that apple would do anything to risk unit demand although as i explained above i dont think the risk is particularly great. instead apple likely increased the pricing in an attempt to maintaingross profit margins generation over generation. both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus improved generation over generation but the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 plus arguably saw a more dramatic improvement. in particular the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus features a dual lens camera whereas the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus shared the same lens count and it also features 00NUMBER00 more system memory whereas the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus had the same amount of memory. that extra 00NUMBER00 likely serves to simply offset those increased bill of materials costs. at the end of the day i strongly suspect that high end smartphone buyers want additional innovative new features. moreover it seems likely that they are fairly willing to pay a premium for those improvements. in that context a 00NUMBER00 premium just doesnt seem like a whole lot and apples strategy here seems sound although well have to see how the new phone does in the marketplace

author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. at its product launch event on sept. 00NUMBER00 applenasdaq aapl revealed some updates to its smartwatch lineup. the new line of wearables which the company dubs apple watch series 00NUMBER00 features a number of enhancements over the first generation offering. lets take a look at these enhancements to see what consumers and investors can expect from the series 00NUMBER00. according to apple the new apple watch comes with a second generation system in package known as the apple 00NUMBER00 unsurprising since the prior generation apple watch used a system in package known as the 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 apparently features a dual core processor which the company claims makes it up to 00NUMBER00 faster in cpu tasks relative to the 00NUMBER00. perhaps more interesting apple claims that the 00NUMBER00 includes an entirely new graphics processor thats up to twice as fast as what the company included in the original model. while there were no disclosures around the manufacturing technology used to build the new processor inside of the 00NUMBER00 according to kgi securities ming chi kuo via digitimes the processor is manufactured using taiwan semiconductor manufacturing 00NUMBER00 nanometer process technology. the move to a newer much more efficient manufacturing technology was likely a key enabler of this significant performance improvement. apple says that the series 00NUMBER00 includes an improved display that according to coo jeff williams is more than two times brighter than the display found on the prior generation device. in fact he claims that it is the brightest display that apple has ever shipped on any product. it makes all the difference when youre outside in the bright sunlight williams said. apple also says that the new watch has a water resistance rating of 00NUMBER00 meters under iso standard 00NUMBER00. the company explains on its website that the device may be used for shallow water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean but with the caveat that activities involving high velocity water or submersion below shallow depth are not advised. given that the apple watch is pitched and likely used as a fitness device being able to use it during swims for example should be a nice selling point. on top of that the series 00NUMBER00 comes with a built in gps. at this point the company has one job to make the apple watch increasingly useful and appealing to consumers. cramming new features into such a device while at the same time keeping both battery life and size in check is no trivial feat so apples efforts with the second generation watch should be lauded. it remains to be seen how well the series 00NUMBER00 will be received by customers but my suspicion is that the new models should do better in the marketplace than the prior generation offering. the new features and performance enhancements appear to be genuinely practical and should improve the user experience so there is reason for optimism. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

pulled back about 00NUMBER00. while its not a significant sell off its worth noting since the stock was already trading conservatively. is this a buying opportunity or is a lower share price justifiediphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. its true that the iphone 00NUMBER00 may not represent a significant step change compared with its predecessor. sure its water resistant comes in new colors has a faster processor and sports a better camera. but with the same overall form factor as both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and the two year old iphone 00NUMBER00 the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch departs from the apples typical pattern of overhauling the phones exterior every two years. by keeping the same form factor some investors might feel apple is missing out on potential incremental iphone sales after all the significant form factor change to the iphone 00NUMBER00 compared with the iphone 00NUMBER00 before it sparked a monster boost in iphone sales. data for chart retrieved from apple sec filings for quarters shown. chart source author. for the quarters iphone 00NUMBER00 was apples flagship phone total smartphone unit sales during this period increased an impressive 00NUMBER00 compared with the prior years sales. on the other hand iphone sales during the iphone 00NUMBER00 first three quarters of flagship sales have largely been a disappointment. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 iphone unit sales were down 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 year over year respectively. and the revenue comparisons for the segment during these periods were even worse with year over year declines of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. since iphone 00NUMBER00 sported a new form factor and iphone 00NUMBER00 didnt the respective performance of apples iphone segment during these two phones flagship years provides context for why investors may be be concerned about iphone 00NUMBER00 prospects. while it was clear going into apples event that the iphone 00NUMBER00 probably wouldnt include any major changes to its outer design some investors may have been hoping for a more significant feature to set it apart akin to siri for the iphone 00NUMBER00. for example investors may have been hoping apple would deliver a bigger improvement is battery life. with some competing smartphones already outperforming iphone on this front a significant jump in battery life could have been a key selling point. but the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus two and one hour increases in battery life compared with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus respectively werent enough to get excited about. so should investors be worried about iphone or not i dont think so. sure the iphone 00NUMBER00 doesnt possess the characteristics needed to guarantee iphone sales will return to growth during the next four quarters. but there are two things apple shareholders should keep in mind to fully capture the stocks potential. image source the motley fool. first apple investors should realize that apples iphone segment shouldnt be judged solely by the performance of each years flagship phone. instead the segment should be viewed at a 00NUMBER00 foot level taking into consideration apples customer loyalty pricing power history of blockbuster product hits and an inevitable return to a more significantly redesigned iphone every now and then even if it may take more than two years sometimes. when investors zoom out and look at apples iphone business with a more holistic approach apples iphone business looks healthy. indeed the best explanation for lower upgrade rates for the iphone 00NUMBER00 compared with the iphone 00NUMBER00 is simply that customers are holding onto their iphones longer an unsurprising side effect of apples relentless efforts to create products with the best user experience. apple reiterated in its most recent earnings call its installed base of active ios devices is growing and the rate of people switching from other smartphone brands to the iphone is at the highest rate it has ever recorded. as it turns out apples planned new iphone for next year is rumoredto include a major overhaul to its form factor surprise. so while the street worries about the possibility of another year of declining iphone sales apple may be preparing for its best iphone upgrade option ever. secondapple stocks valuation simply doesnt price in growth anyway. with a price to earnings ratio of just 00NUMBER00 apples revenue could never grow from current levels and investors could still earn a good return on their investment from todays stock price of 00NUMBER00. apple can increase the intrinsic value of its shares over the years by simultaneously repurchasing shares and paying out dividends just as it has been doing since 00NUMBER00. its difficult to predict how iphone 00NUMBER00 sales will fare. and its even more difficult to predict where apple stock will go as the street contemplates the implications of quarter to quarter iphone sales. but this iphone 00NUMBER00 sell off definitely looks like a good opportunity for buy and hold investors to pick up shares. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds

speaking i really like applesnasdaq aapl latest iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus series. the phones offer leadership specifications they look quite nice especially in those two new finishes and i expect that the overall user experience of these devices will be unmatched by any rival smartphones. apple has done an incredibly good job with these phones and i look forward to seeing what else comes out of the idevice makers iphone innovation pipeline in the years to come. that being said although these new devices are extremely compelling i pre ordered a black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus this morning so i put my money where my mouth is there are two aspects of the new device that are a bit disappointing. earlier this year apple introduced a new 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. one of the best features of this device is something that apple markets as a true tone display. the idea behind this is simple the ipad pro is able to sense the color temperature of ones surroundings and dynamically adjust the color temperature of the display to match. its a reallyawesome feature and one that i had expected and hoped would make it into the new iphone. unfortunately apple omitted it from both the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. its not clear whether apple faced some technical hurdles getting this technology into the new phones or whether it was an issue with cost. nevertheless this is a feature that i hope apple brings to a future iphone as soon as possible. the good news is that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus employ displays that employ the wider dci 00NUMBER00 color gamut a significant improvement from the mere srgb color space coverage of prior iphone displays. apples new cameras also take photos in wide color so iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus users should be able to quickly generate a ton of content that takes advantage of that new display. its awesome. however one area that apple didnt seem to improve is the contrast ratios of the displays. according to apples tech specs page the iphone 00NUMBER00 display delivers a contrast ratio of 00NUMBER00 while the display on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus offers a slightly worse 00NUMBER00 contrast ratio. this essentially means that the color black is no deeper on these new iphones than it was on the last two iphones. this obviously isnt a deal breaker i still expect the displays on these new iphones to look quite good but it would have been nice to see some enhancements on this front. as a consolation next years iphone is expected to employ an oled display. this means that the contrast ratios on those phones should technically be infinite a marked improvement from the displays on this years iphones. to be blunt the fact that i only found these two things truly disappointing is extremely encouraging i like to think that im pretty critical when it comes to what i want from a flagship smartphone. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 i just cant find much to complain aboutitll be interesting to observe how well these smartphones do in the marketplace but i would hope that they fare better than the prior generation iphone 00NUMBER00 series because they really are that much better. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  applenasdaq aapl recently unveiled the new iphone 00NUMBER00 to mixed reviews and many analysts are busy debating its impact on the tech giants earnings this year. but investors should note that another major issue hangs over the company the â‚¬ 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 billion tax bill it faces in ireland. image source apple. in late august the eu ruled that  ireland gave apple illegal tax benefits which lowered its effective corporate tax rate on its profits from 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. in other words apple allegedly paid just 00NUMBER00 in tax for every 00NUMBER00 million in profits it booked in ireland. it also ruled that apple avoided higher taxes in other eu countries by reporting all its european profits in ireland. other reports indicate that  apple might have funneled two thirds ofallits overseas profits through the country to reduce its global tax burden. apple claims to have regularly paid irelands 00NUMBER00 corporate tax rate on those profits. ceo tim cook condemned the ruling as total political crap and claimed that the eu commission just picked a number. the company vowed to appeal the ruling but the irish department of finance recently admitted that it would likely need to collect the payment. if that happens it could hurt apple and other u. s. tech companies with irish ties. the eu ruling wont cripple the company since 00NUMBER00 billion amounts to just 00NUMBER00 of its overseas cash hoard of 00NUMBER00 billion. even if apple paid the full amount it would likely be written off as a one time charge and wouldnt be considered a major weight on its long term growth. the eu also stated that the final amount could be reduced by an agreement or if apple agreed to pay back the taxes to individual countries. however accepting the tax bill could trap apple between a rock and a hard place. back in the u. s. members of congress have called apple a corporate tax dodger for its  refusal to repatriate its overseas profits. apple gets tax credits for overseas taxes yet the company isnt taxed unless it brings the cash back home. apple argues that the u. s. corporate tax rate of 00NUMBER00 one of the highest in the world is unfair and discourages it from doing so. thats also why it funds its stock buybacks with debt instead of cash. image source getty images. but theres a silver lining to this dilemma if apple ends up paying the full amount it can  actually earn a 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 credit on those overseas payments againstits u. s. taxes. this means that if apple is forced to pay the bill it could repatriate some cash back to the united states while reducing its u. s. tax bill by 00NUMBER00 billion. microsoftalphabet andfacebook also have major presences in ireland. like apple all three tech giants have been accused of funneling overseas profits through the country to reduce  their taxes. this means that they could be next on the chopping block. all three companies already face plenty of other headaches in the eu. three years ago the eu fined microsoft over 00NUMBER00 million for failing to respect a previous antitrust settlement. the

these companies as well as many other multinationals to reevaluate the future of their european operations. if the eu continues to scrutinize ireland these companies could move to other regions that are willing to exchange lower tax rates for jobs and economic growth. the eu ruling against apple is a thorny issue. apple claims that it played by the rules but the industry practice of funneling

company has gotten rid of the headphone jack a bold move certainly but one thats not nearly as big a deal as many have made it out to be. thats at least partly because many people do not understand what apple has done. yes the iphone maker has gotten rid of the traditional 00NUMBER00 mm headphone jack but it has not as many people are assuming forced its customers to use much more expensive wireless headphones including its own 00NUMBER00 earpods. instead apple has actually made a very measured move to wean people off the headphone jack and push them toward a wireless future. apples new wireless earpods are an optional accessory. image source apple. the new iphone 00NUMBER00 will not have a 00NUMBER00 mm headphone jack. instead it will come with a set of apple earbuds designed to plug into the phones lightning connector port. and for people who already own headphones that plug into the the traditional jack the company has also included an adapter with all of its new phones. in addition apple has introduced its new wireless headphones which can be used with the new models or any phone that has bluetooth. this is not new technology and bluetooth headphones have been available for years. apple has made a big change in dropping the headphone jack but it hedged its bets and gave its customers a fair chance to adapt by offering them a set of headphones that connect via the lightning port and including an adapter. its also worth noting that the company sells additional lightning to 00NUMBER00 mm adapters for 00NUMBER00 on its website a price that third party providers both authorized and illicit will almost assuredly beat soon. there are two major negatives to what apple has done for people who use the headphone jack. the first is that if you have your headphones plugged into your lightning port you cannot use that port to charge your phone. thats a concern that may be somewhat overridden by the fact that according to the company the base model iphone 00NUMBER00 has two extra hours of battery life compared to its predecessor. of course for some this will still be an issue and while there are adaptersthat allow for charging and listening at the same time not having separate ports may sometimes be annoying. the second issue and this may be the bigger one is that many people lose their headphones a lot and buy cheap earbuds. for those people this change might be a bit expensive because using cheap headphones will require holding onto or buying more of the lightning to 00NUMBER00 mm adapter. sub 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 mm headphones can be had at pretty much every convenience store or rest stop. lightning headphones exist but they are much less prevalent and prices start at around 00NUMBER00. that essentially means that apple dropping the headphone jack will be an annoyance for people who like to charge their phone while listening to headphones and an expense for people prone to losing earbuds andor adapter dongles. there was a point when dropping the disk drive and later the cddvd drive seemed like an outrageous move that people would never put up with. over time however we have become used to not having disks cd or dvds and the idea of including one in a computer seems as out of date as buying a vhs player. apple may be ahead of the curve here but the headphone jacks days are numbered across all top tier smartphones. somebody had to lead the way and apple has done so in as painless a way as possible. consumers arent losing something here. theyre gaining a little bit more space in the phone for apple to cram other technology in at the expense of a jack that no longer serves a purpose. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  the new iphone. image source apple. as youve probably heard by now applenasdaq aapl is eliminating the standard 00NUMBER00 mm headphone jack in its latest iphone models the iphone 00NUMBER00 line. according to some this is a travesty unparalleled in the history of technology. rumors had already circulated that apple was ditching the 00NUMBER00 year old headphone port but a heavy backlash nonetheless ensued following apples confirmation during the phone release event. apple was roundly reamed across the mediai love you apple and i dont mean to sound like a baby but i really dont want to give up my headphone jack. apple has terrible reasons for removing the iphones headphone jackhttpst. 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 dont need special headphones to hear the griping about apple nixing the headphone jackhttpst. 00NUMBER00. twittercomuuprxxtyhathe kerfuffle boils down to one key issue convenience. every iphone owner already has a pair of 00NUMBER00 mm earbuds and almost the entire universe of existing audio components is compatible with the standard jack. importantly apple will provide a free adapter that attaches through the lightning charging port and essentially solves the compatibility issue though in a less convenient way. it would have been easy to stick with the traditional audio port after all but thats not how innovation works. every year apple introduces the latest version of its flagship product the iphone. theres no reason to release a new one without any changes or improvements. consumers who are happy with their current phone can just keep that one or if they wish to upgrade can move up to an iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 which have the standard jack. but apple has to keep innovating if it expects to stay ahead of the competition and sell new products. thats how the tech industry works and its how apple got to the top in the first place. the company repeatedly calls out the words best and innovative in its own press materials. apple has long been guided by the steve jobs mantra that consumers dont know what they want until they see it and innovation often requires making popular features and technologies obsolete. the company has done it before by for instance upgrading from the original 00NUMBER00 pin connector to the lightning connector and it will do it again. apple is leading consumers into a wireless future its doing that because it has to. paying 00NUMBER00 for airpods may not sound appealing today but wireless headphones are the future. and thats a blessing for anyone whos ever taken an iphone for a run or wasted minutes untangling a mess of earbuds shoved in their pockets. apple didnt simply eliminate the jack out of courage as executive phil schiller said during the presentation there are real benefits to doing so. taking it out allows the phone to be water resistant. thats no small detail one repair center said water is the most common cause of broken iphones and aside from impact damage like from dropping it on a hard surface liquid is the only real way a consumer can break one. water resistance is an improvement thats long overdue and consumers have been asking for it for years. the headphone jack also takes up valuable space inside the iphone competing with camera technologies processors and battery life as apple exec dan riccio told buzzfeed. in order to make the phone better which it needs to do to justify releasing a new one apple had to jettison an antiquated technology that was taking up empty space. because apple removed the jack battery life another major source of customer complaints is now 00NUMBER00 longer in the iphone 00NUMBER00 the camera is much more powerful and the speakers are better. you can argue that those improvements arent worth losing the headphone jack but they are significant. finally its worth noting that apple isnt even the first phone maker to remove the headphone jack. motorolas recent moto z comes without a jack and chinese phone maker oppo electronics had a jack less phone on the market as early as four years ago. apples decision should however hasten the shift away from the standard audio jack. the iphone maker has ditched key ports on other products before like the 00NUMBER00 floppy drive and the cd rom in macs the customer protests eventually subside and everyone moves along. this should be no different. its a credit to apples brand that its customers feel so connected that theyre willing to go to great lengths to protest this kind of move in ways that probably no one would for an android phone. but its worth remembering that passion means the protesters are likely the companys most loyal customers and will eventually buy other apple products when the time is right. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

program. the strategy has always been to use bond offerings to bolster its domestic cash position allowing it to keep the majority of its money mountain abroad and avoid repatriation taxes. in that short amount of time the mac maker has since accumulated approximately 00NUMBER00 billion in debt which is greater than the market caps of many companies. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. at the end of last quarter apple had 00NUMBER00 billion in total long term debt including current and non current. it then sold 00NUMBER00 billion worth of paper at the end of july bringing the total to nearly 00NUMBER00 billion. note that this total does not include commercial paper which apple started selling in 00NUMBER00. apple currently has 00NUMBER00 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to long term debt. the debt strategy has been quite successful thus far. apple has been able to fund its highly accretive share repurchase program without needing to bring foreign cash home of which there was 00NUMBER00 billion at the end of last quarter. meanwhile the interest and dividend income from apples broader investment portfolio actually covers the interest payments and more than services the debt so there is no net costto apple. metricamount mrqinterest and dividend 00NUMBER00 billioninterest 00NUMBER00 millionnet interest 00NUMBER00 milliondata source 00NUMBER00 q. mrq most recent quarter. but still there is some limit where enough is enough. apple cant just continue issuing debt ad nauseam even if its consolidated net cash position is still 00NUMBER00 billion. there are signs that tim cook is aware of this. in a recent radio interview cook mentioned that apple does expect to repatriate billions of dollars as early as next year. while the ceo didnt disclose an exact amount he said that apple has provisioned several billion dollars for taxes which suggests that the mac maker will be bringing home quite a bit considering the current repatriation rate of 00NUMBER00. apple has lobbied hard to get congress to lower that rate arguing that the u. s. would benefit from many companies repatriating cash and investing it domestically. its quite telling that apple is sharing its plans to repatriate a bunch of money warning investors to brace themselves for a hefty tax bill. its also possible that the eus recent decision that apple owes 00NUMBER00 billion in back taxes related to its irish tax breaks which apple is appealing calls into question the viability of the companys international tax minimization strategies. you know that apple wouldnt voluntarily choose to pay those taxes unless it absolutely had to which implies that it feels that its debt load is approaching some comfort limit. a secret billion dollar stock

apple. on sept. 00NUMBER00 applenasdaq aapl took the wraps off its next generation iphones the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. although the cosmetic changes to these phones werent huge the devices represent a very solid step forwardfor iphone and indeed the premium smartphone in general. the success of apples iphone business is really a function of two key metrics. the first is straight up unit shipments after all all else equal the more iphones apple sells the better. however the business also depends on the average selling prices of those phones the higher those are for a given level of unit shipments the better off apples revenue and gross profits should be. although its too early to tell what the unit shipment story for iphone 00NUMBER00 is going to look like there are early signs that the average selling price story could be quite positive for apple during this product cycle. here are three reasons why. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 and their plus counterparts the differentiation between the smaller iphone and its larger sibling was fairly limited. the bigger models had slightly sharper displays and a few additional but relatively minor camera features and they were a little bulkier. the choice between the smaller and larger models at least for those two generations of products really boiled down to screen size preference. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 generation apple has differentiated the two models a little more aggressively. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sports an innovative dual camera setup which means from a camera feature perspective the larger model is the clear one to get. though this might not seem like much the camera is easily one of the most important parts of a smartphone. based on that i think that the dual camera might be enough to get potential buyers to step up to the larger model this time around. for a given amount of storage the larger iphone is 00NUMBER00 more expensive than the smaller one so a mix shift toward the larger iphone as a result of this new camera feature could drive average selling prices up year over year. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus apple introduced two new casing colors black and jet black. the jet black version according to apple is accomplished through an innovative nine step process of anodization and polish for a uniform glossy finish. interestingly apple is offering this special jet black model only in iphone configurations with 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of onboard storage. if this model becomes particularly popular with customers apple could enjoy a richer product mix. and given that pre orders of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in jet black from apples online store arent expected to ship until november it is likely that it will be quite popular. both the smaller and larger iphones have traditionally come with the same amount of system memory 00NUMBER00 gb in the case of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus and 00NUMBER00 gb for the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. its widely believed that this time around the larger iphone will get 00NUMBER00 gb of memory while the smaller version will have only 00NUMBER00 gb. this isnt likely to matter to most consumers after all apple doesnt even market the amount of memory it includes inside its phones. however the more tech savvy buyers will likely learn of this from reading reviews or looking at tear downs of the devices. the additional memory in the larger model could be attractive to some of those customers. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the

showing up as the company prepares to release the final version of ios 00NUMBER00 to the public on tuesday. several of the apps are designed to add additional functionality to messenger. the company will also be launching a messenger app store tomorrow to give users an easy way to search for these types of apps. battery life a new report claims that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have better batteries than their predecessors appleinisdernotes. the report claims that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will come with 00NUMBER00 milliamp hour battery. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was powered by 00NUMBER00 hour battery. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will reportedly have 00NUMBER00 milliamp hour battery. this is an increase over 00NUMBER00 milliamp hour battery found in the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. this will hopefully help to keep owners from having to charge their smartphones multiple times per day. iphone 00NUMBER00 may have ceramic shell there are rumors floating about that the iphone 00NUMBER00 will have a ceramic shell reports bgr. according to this rumor the tech company may choose to use a ceramic case made of zirconia for its next major iphone. this report claims that zirconia would be a great fit for the smartphone due to its ability to better disperse heat than aluminum. it can also let radio waves through which would negate the need for antenna bands. the company has already announced an apple watch series 00NUMBER00 device that has a ceramic case. it has also filed a patent that showed the possibility of using ceramics for an iphone shell. the post monday apple

kill off 00NUMBER00 gb iphones for years arguing that such a paltry amount of storage was insultingly low. the critics are right on that front but apple was able to fend off the backlash for quite a while. last years iphone 00NUMBER00 started at 00NUMBER00 gb but this year apple has given in to consumer pressure and doubled all storage capacities with the entry level model now starting at 00NUMBER00 gb. the thing is that investors should have appreciated the stubbornness particularly after apple introduced a new pricing structure in 00NUMBER00 that strongly encouraged upsells. in 00NUMBER00 mid tier storage quadrupled to 00NUMBER00 gb for an extra 00NUMBER00. combined with the introduction of the larger plus models the net result was a strong lift in iphone average selling prices asps over the next two years. what happens now that the 00NUMBER00 gb model is deadits long been obvious that 00NUMBER00 gb of storage really is insufficient for the vast majority of modern smartphone users. apple defended itself by pointing to increased adoption of cloud storage and services but that defense doesnt hold much water once you add 00NUMBER00 video recording to the device. the real question is whether or not 00NUMBER00 gb is actually sufficient for peoples needs in which case the mid tier upsell which is now 00NUMBER00 gb is less compelling. quadrupling storage for 00NUMBER00 is still appealing but less necessary than before. simply put the upsell used to be a no brainer but now the customer actually has a decision to make. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. to be clear there are definitely some potential mitigating factors that could offset any lower uptake in storage upgrades. fellow fool contributor ashraf eassapoints to the fact that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models are getting a strong differentiating selling point in the dual camera system combined with the modest 00NUMBER00 price increase relative to prior plus models. on top of that the new jet black color that apple touted at length in the unveiling presentation is exclusive to the 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb variants. iphone asps did post a notable sequential decline last quarter to 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00 in the first quarter but this was driven primarily by the recent introduction of the iphone se. that entry level 00NUMBER00 inch device starts at just 00NUMBER00 while including pretty competitive internal specs. for what its worth apple expects asps to recover this quarter as the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launch but well have to wait to see by how much. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

capabilities of a car that does not need a driver to operate it. a new industry has been created that investors are watching as it will likely take off in the next few years. more and more companies are in the race to have the first completely self driven vehicle. tesla has created an auto pilot feature and uber has also gained momentum in the self driving car space by purchasing otto and testing actual self driving cars in pittsburgh. google is also in the mix of course pouring millions of dollars into their testing projects. the biggest question mark in the nascent industry thus far though has been apple. apple is facing declining iphone sales and therefore has reportedly decided to try and create a car themselves. however there have been setbacks with this initiative. apple just laid off dozens of workers involved with the car project and progress in their mission is looking slow and bleak. in a recent reboot of the project it seems apple is reportedly shifting away from designing the actual automobile and focusing more attention to the base technology of the vehicle. this shift could bring about an industry change where tech companies focus less on the car itself and more on the internal platform of the car and its operations system. with more emphasis being placed on batteries and underlying technology the future of transportation could eventually bring major changes for consumers. for the moment all electric cars are a priority for auto makers so apple’s move may take some pressure off the old school detroit trio. ultimately it remains unclear if the self driving car industry will have more in common with the technology industry rather than the automobile space. traditional auto companies have responded to the threat from ride sharing services by creating additional business lines and pushing for global operations. ford motor company just purchased chariot a shuttle service in the hopes of keeping their efforts in expanding to different transportation services. ford has also announced it is creating “ford gobike” a bike sharing service for metro areas. at the citi 00NUMBER00 global technology conference general motors company released progress on their new product the chrevolet bolt ev. the vehicle is an all electric long range car 00NUMBER00 miles on a single charge priced below 00NUMBER00 and contains enhanced features like pedestrian alert notification and wi fi. additionally there is a small fleet of the electric cars in san francisco testing self driving capabilities. for any major motor company actions like these are key. otherwise survival in producing traditional cars will prove difficult due to the competition from high tech firms. automakers now need to shift their view of themselves to more of a technology company and not just a car manufacturer. while there is no clear winner of the self driving car race at this stage investors definitely need to keep an eye on the space. it’s unclear at this stage if the future in autonomous vehicles will belong to tech companies or traditional automakers. both groups are investing heavily to create an autonomous vehicle and they are getting closer. apple’s reboot shows that there may be more ways to make money in the space than investors have considered thus far. this article was originally published on oilpricecom. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views

rumorsfor wednesday. iphone 00NUMBER00 reviews reviews of apples iphone 00NUMBER00 are starting to show up online reports 00NUMBER00. the general consensus is that the iphone 00NUMBER00 is another great additions to aapls lineup. however there are a few complaints that were present in most reviews. the first one is the missing headphone jack from the iphone 00NUMBER00. this was a controversial move to begin with and wasnt expected to be well received. the second major complaints was how easily the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 scratches. the final big complaint from reviewers was the poor

tucked away inside of nytsreview for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. the reviewer notes that two sources close to the matter said the 00NUMBER00 iphone will have a full frontal display and a virtual home button built into it. the sources didnt reveal their names due to the nature of the information. battery life apple fans upgrading to ios 00NUMBER00 will likely see a temporary decrease in battery life reports bgr. users are likely going to be using their ios 00NUMBER00 devices more after installing the update and this will drain the battery much quicker. however once they have become familiar with all the new features they are likely to return to more normal levels of using the device. theres also the fact that the mobile operating system will have to reindex all sorts of information following the update. this occurs in the background and will result in shorter battery life after the update but will finish in time. there are actually several optimization changes with ios 00NUMBER00 that should help increase the battery life of mobile devices. the post apple inc. rumors iphone 00NUMBER00 reviews are outappeared first oninvestorplace. the views and opinions

00NUMBER00. image source apple. hi my name is evan and i am an annual iphone upgrader. i never intended it to be like this. buying a new iphone every year is clearly a poor financial decision. i just found new ways to justify it every year and applesnasdaq aapl marketing department was always willing to enable me. one year it was siri. another year it was a bigger screen. then it was an even biggerscreen. last year it was 00NUMBER00 touch. enough is enough. the only iphone that i never bought was the iphone 00NUMBER00 released in 00NUMBER00. ive been an annual upgrader ever since but i wont be buying the iphone 00NUMBER00. last years iphone 00NUMBER00 upgrade actually disappointed me. apple touted 00NUMBER00 touch as the big new headline feature but its proven to be more of a novelty than a practical improvement that you use daily. kind of like siri. for a while there the performance improvements each year made it somewhat worthwhile as modern smartphones were still a relatively new product category. but as smartphones have matured in the years since the annual gains moderated in practical terms even if the new 00NUMBER00 fusion chip is technically 00NUMBER00 faster than the 00NUMBER00. this is no surprise. weve all seen this coming as new features and performance gains have increasingly leaned toward the evolutionary side of the spectrum peak smartphone as it were. this is true of the iphone 00NUMBER00 which includes a wide range of incremental improvements across the device but no real key selling point as in prior years. everything is just a little bit better. the strongest selling point is the new dual camera system on the 00NUMBER00 plus but i personally dont like phones that big. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 failing to impress a diehard apple loyalist like me i cant help but wonder how this may affect the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 upgrade cycle. the pressure is on now that iphone unit sales have seemingly plateaued and apple is testing the markets patience by using the same overall design. the good news for investors is that early demand appears strong at the carrier level and apples initial inventory looks to be sold out already. all of this being said its still highly likely that i will end up upgrading to the iphone 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 or whatever the hell apple decides to call the 00NUMBER00 generation iphone. i still consider it personal progress to move from upgrading every year to upgrading every other year like a rational human being. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

record when it comes to predicting changes in aapl devices. according to kuo the tech company will be adding more apps that use the pencil stylus. theres also talk that the device will get a base

back quarters with year over year iphone unit sales declines. this inevitability has been expected for quite some time as the product matures and smartphone adoption has soared in developed markets. theres still quite a bit of work for the mac maker to do on the emerging market front but i think its safe to say that theres no more low hanging fruit left in the global smartphone market. but are iphone unit sales really peaking or can the iphone 00NUMBER00 and future models potentially return apple back to growth one dayif you look back at the past couple of upgrade cycles youll notice that iphone launches tend to perform in pairs due to apples s cycles. a redesigned new model is introduced pushes unit sales to new highs and the subsequent s cycle roughly matches it the following year. this makes sense considering the average user upgrades their phone every two years and this two year s cycle was timed perfectly to capture most users in alternating years. the past two design cycles showed comparable unit sales in pairs. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. the 00NUMBER00 cycle in 00NUMBER00 was a bit different for a couple of reasons. at that time apple was still expanding carrier relationships making year over year comparisons less comparable. on top of that steve jobs died the day after the 00NUMBER00 was introduced triggering a global outpouring of support and sympathy for apples fallen founder. this likely resulted in additional sales. iphone unit sales more than doubled year over year in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 up 00NUMBER00 following jobs passing. the pattern for the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 launches is apparent though. if it continues all of the people that upgraded to the iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 are all due for an upgrade to the iphone 00NUMBER00. by the looks of it initial demand is quite strong as well with numerous carrier partners touting strong preorder activity. optimism around the iphone 00NUMBER00 has even now pushed apple shares to fresh 00NUMBER00 highs. however there is a curve ball. this is the first time that apple will use the same overall design for a third year. as unheard of as keeping designs around for two years was in the smartphone industry no other oem could get away with this keeping a design for three is unprecedented. its not clear how much value the market allocates to fresh designs since apple is offering other reasons to upgrade. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is a home run for people that loathe headphone jacks for instance. all of the aforementioned considerations about growth constraints still apply so apple still needs to focus on winning over android switchers in developed markets while also catering to first time adopters in emerging markets. but if iphone launches continue to perform in pairs the iphone 00NUMBER00 may be able to reclaim growth. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the

00NUMBER00 on wednesday topping one of the biggest three day rallies in the stock in recent memory. while apple stock might be somewhat overbought now in the short term this latest rally has put shares in a more constructive posture for the next few months. in other words aapl stock is becoming a buy on dips rather than a sell on rips. after last weeks new product announcements which included the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus apple initially traded lower for a couple of days. but this tone drastically changed on monday when the bulls stepped in with a vengeance leading to this three day 00NUMBER00 rally. this sudden rally has come on a plethora of its not so bad to its good commentary from the analyst community that may have changed the picture. this morning things look to continue as reports say apple has sold out of the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 and all colors of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. apple stock has seen a great deal of upside call buying over the past couple of days which shows how giddy traders have acted this week. as a side note aapl shares at 00NUMBER00 year to date are outperforming the sp 00NUMBER00. how about that. looking at the multiyear chart we see that aapl topped out in april 00NUMBER00 as it became too overextended above its longer term support line. the mean reversion move lower from april 00NUMBER00 into the may lows of this year measured more than 00NUMBER00. apples iphone 00NUMBER00 will be a 00NUMBER00 anniversary masterpiecethe summer months however brought about a wind of change as apple stock began to lift. by early august aapl managed to break past the diagonal resistance line from the 00NUMBER00 highs. the stocks rally so far this week has it forming a notable bullish outside candle. should apple close above 00NUMBER00 that would confirm the breakout past diagonal resistance and make the case for higher prices over the next couple of months. when i last mused about aapl stock on july 00NUMBER00 stock was just beginning to near the aforementioned diagonal resistance line. i wrote that a convinced push and hold above 00NUMBER00 could get the stock rallying toward 00NUMBER00. this 00NUMBER00 price target was reached yesterday from a swing trading perspective im at least taking partial profits right now. click to enlargelooking at the daily chart we see that after the initial breakout past the black diagonal resistance line in august aapl began to pull back. the friday and monday lows in apple coincided with the diagonal former resistance line now support as well as the red 00NUMBER00 day simple moving average. mondays rally formed a bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart which set the stage for the tuesdaywednesday rally. in other words the pullback in apple stock into early september acted as a retest of a former line of resistance. click to enlargeif apple stock can stick a landing on this bullish reversal candle on the weekly chart the stock again becomes a buy on dips rather than a sell on rips. that is if all else is equal and until we see a bigger weekly bearish reversal again. your next upside target on aapl is 00NUMBER00. like what you see sign up for our daily

stocks you need to dump right 00NUMBER00 stock splits investors are dying to seelet the stock picks come to youthe post apple inc. iphone 00NUMBER00 sales are brutalizing the bears aaplappeared first oninvestorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  for traders and investors conventional wisdom is a dangerous thing. not every winning trade comes from a contrarian attitude of course. momentum has a valid place in any trader’s toolkit but when everybody agrees on something for long enough you can be fairly sure that the opposite is about to happen. the logic behind that statement is actually fairly simple. once everybody agrees that something is going down for example and they position themselves accordingly there comes a time when you effectively run out of sellers giving the few remaining buyers the upper hand. that is where apple aapl got to recently but the mood is now changing and as the shorts get squeezed that could lead to a pretty impressive jump in the price. regular readers of my musings will be aware that i have been bullish on the cupertino colossus for some time now. i last wrote about the company back in may when i lauded the decision to take a stake in the chinese ride sharing service didi. what i also pointed out in that article though was that apple’s success has not really been based on stunning innovation. rather it has been a story of incremental improvement and successfully gauging what the public wanted at any given time. back then conventional wisdom was that apple had somehow lost their ability to do that and that some big bold innovation was needed if they were to continue to grow. the assumption contained in that view was that the mobile phone hardware market was saturated and that the iphone had had its day. fast forward to now and the absurdity of that argument is apparent. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is not really anything new in many ways but according to reports this morning the initial production run of the “plus” phone has already sold out and sales of the smaller version are beating expectations. now it seems everybody is coming around to the idea that apple’s growth model still has some life left in it. the flow of talking heads on the financial networks is shifting to those pointing out that at a trailing pe of around 00NUMBER00 apple is despite the recent rally ridiculously cheap. those of us that have been saying that since that pe was around 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 and the stock was trading at around 00NUMBER00 feel vindicated to some extent but must now ask ourselves how far aapl can go. the answer is probably further than most people expect. in my years of writing here i have generally stayed away from sensational claims and predictions. it is not that i haven’t been tempted. i mean nothing generates clicks like a headline claiming that a stock will double or that a “market collapse” is imminent but reality tends to be much more mundane. as a trader i learned a long time ago that that simple truth has a way of coming back to bite you if you ever buy into the hype. with that said though simple logic suggests that over the next few months aapl can smash through its all time high with around 00NUMBER00 being a reasonable target. that level would involve a roughly 00NUMBER00 percent increase in the stock which would approximate to a corresponding increase in the trailing pe. that would leave it closer to but still short of the average. i understand that apple’s trailing pe is low for a reason eps has been moving in the wrong direction for one thing and even if the sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 are enough to turn that trend around there is still the law of large numbers as it pertains to the stock market to deal with. for a relatively small company a ten percent increase in sales and profits is relatively easy to achieve. when annual revenue is measured in the hundreds of billions however you have to sell an awful lot of units to move the needle in percentage terms. in this case though because expectations had sunk so low it won’t take a huge increase in earnings to result in a big increase in the stock price. just returning to growth overall or even just expectations of growth would be enough to normalize aapl in pe terms and that means fifty percent from here is readily achievable. in some ways you can even make a case here that apple’s size will benefit the stock rather than hurt it. aapl has an outsized role in several indices because of that size so fund managers will be forced into getting on board as an upward move takes hold if they just are to keep pace with let alone beat their benchmarks. all in all while aapl at 00NUMBER00 looks on the surface to be a sensational claim it is in reality only logical. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily

reason to get new hardware just yet downloading ios 00NUMBER00 can give them the refresh they want without paying a dime. apples mobile operating system is the heart of almost everything it does with watchos tvos down the line macos being based off ios. its important apple keep adding new features not only to stay ahead of trends but keep its users active apple doesnt have over 00NUMBER00 billion active devices for no reason. that allows apple to keep users sticky towards the platform effectively creating a hardware as a service model with users buying new iphones and not switching to android. despite initial concerns about ios 00NUMBER00 bricking in less geeky speak making your phone useless iphones the latest operating system is now on nearly 00NUMBER00 of devices and is sure to climb over the coming days and weeks. as of sept. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 prior to ios 00NUMBER00 release 00NUMBER00 of idevices ran ios 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 ran ios 00NUMBER00 making it easier for developers to build and update apps and essentially ridding apple of the bifurcation issue android has so notoriously experienced. in honor of the iphones announcement in 00NUMBER00 here are the top 00NUMBER00 reasons ios 00NUMBER00 is worth downloading and what it means for apple its partners and its shareholders. 00NUMBER00. imessage as a hubin june at its worldwide developer conference apple placed huge emphasis on redesigning ios and turning imessage and its 00NUMBER00 million users into a hub. by doing so its keeping people more engaged on ios while borrowing popular services from social networks like snapchat and facebook. new to ios 00NUMBER00 are stickers pictures someone can place next to a message to help them communicate in a more fun way to whomever theyre talking to. super mario dc marvel and disney characters are just some of the sticker groups coming to ios 00NUMBER00. some of them are free like the ones for super mario run while others are paid like some from disney. this provides new revenue opportunities for apple and its partners kim kardashian has made a killing selling emojis while keeping apple at the forefront of messaging and communication trends. apples imessage is also opening up to outside developers letting companies like venmo or square allow its users to send and receive payments inside imessage. payments is an absurdly hot space and anything apple can do to get a piece of the pie is good for stickiness and potentially boosting revenue down the line. 00NUMBER00. siri has friendsfinally apple has opened up siri to outside developers and early results are that its working as expected. now siri works with a select group of apps transportation fitness messaging etc. to do things like let users send messages make phone calls or call a lyftuber. artificial intelligence in this case soft ai is a burgeoning space. apple wants to show it can use its voice assistant to stay ahead of the competition while not hurting user privacy at the same time. 00NUMBER00. maps magicits no secret maps are a hot space right now. everyone from uber to google to tesla are looking to improve their mapping capabilities. after early snafus with its platform apple maps has become one of the most if not the most prominent mapping app out there. with ios 00NUMBER00 apple maps lets its users order a lyft or an uber inside so they dont have to leave the app. sure thats been available on google maps for some time but apples user interface and ease of use are sure to be appealing to the ios user base. given that apple maps is more popular than google maps on ios this a welcomed feature. 00NUMBER00. photos smarter than youapple is working hard to make sure the smartphone is the best camera people own. while it cant replace your dslr just yet the software advancements made in ios 00NUMBER00 give it distinct advantages. thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning its now easier to find people places or points of interest in a users photos. if someone wants to find all their photos with their best friend bob in it just say hey siri find all my photos with bob in it and the camera software will find photos with bob in it. 00NUMBER00. shiny new apple musicapple music was much maligned when it was introduced last year with poor usability cited as the key negative factor. a year and more than 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers later apple music is getting a redesign. its much simpler to use music discovery is paramount and the company is working on adding exclusive and great content all the time see frank ocean carpool karakoke etc. . it also appears that with the oft rumored dr. dre series apple backed planet of the apps show and carpool karaoke apple is dipping its toes in the water of scripted content. does this pave the way for apple to produce its own tv shows and have apple music become apple 00NUMBER00. news you can useits no secret the media industry is struggling but apple is doing all it can to help. as part of ios 00NUMBER00 apple news and its 00NUMBER00 million monthly active users is getting a drastic redesign making it easier easier to find stories. it also added the ability to offer bold typography vibrant colors and distinct selections. 00NUMBER00. home is where the heart isgiven the success of the amazon echo family and the upcoming release of the google home apple is intent on winning its fair share of smart home users with an app at least until we get apples version of the echo. home is a new app that lets users easily manage their home automation products in one place like their nest thermostat smart lights garage door etc. its not a must have feature for most people yet and its unclear where apples ambitions lie in the smart home category but its a nice cherry on top feature to apples latest mobile operating system. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of

invested about 00NUMBER00 million in the china based ride hailing start updidi chuxing. by itself the news isnt all that surprising. tech companies like foxconn invest in other start ups all the time so why should this one be any different well because didi is the third most valuable tech start up right now and is one of the most powerful ride hailing companies in the world. in short didi is transforming the automotive landscape and large tech companies want in on the action. for those who havent been following along at home didi offers a myriad of transportation servicesacross china including taxi hailing services rental cars social sharing rides bus passes and of course its ride hailing services that are similar to what uber does here in the u. s. the company offers its services in more than 00NUMBER00 cities in china and completes about 00NUMBER00 million rides every single day. as if all that werent enough the company just bought ubers businessin china last month. that included ubers brand in china and all of the data it owned on its chinese customers. uber didnt walk away empty handed though. the company now has a 00NUMBER00 stake in uber and the ceos of each company are now on the others board. the foxconn investment through its foxteq holdings subsidiary adds yet another high profile tech company as a didi chuxing investor. the list now includes uber chinese tech juggernauts alibabaand tencent and apple. you may remember that the iphone maker threw 00NUMBER00 billion into didis pot just four months ago. all of those investments as well as the uber deal have helped push didis valuation up to 00NUMBER00 billion. for comparisons sake uber is valued at 00NUMBER00 billion. foxconns investment isnt all that much compared to what apple and others have invested but it brings didis total of investments over the past year to more than 00NUMBER00 billion most of which has come over the past few months. clearly one of the most important things didi has done with that money is to eliminate one of its major competitors uber in the chinese market. uber was probably just as excited to strike a deal as didi was considering the u. s. based ride hailing company had reportedly blown through 00NUMBER00 billion in two years trying to outpace didi. but didi will also use the influx of cash from foxconn and its other investors to focus on chinas growing rental car market as well. earlier this month the company announced that it will lease vehicles and then rent them out to its customers as it tries to snatch up market share in the burgeoning 00NUMBER00 billion chinese rental car market. the foxconn investment is yet another signpost pointing to didi chuxings success in chinas automotive market. didi is proving to be one of the most influential transportation start ups in the world and with a fresh influx of cash the uber deal working its way through legal approval and a new step in rental car direction this company is clearly just getting started. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

of a live stream. iphone 00NUMBER00 drop tests iphone 00NUMBER00 owners are also putting their devices through drop tests to see how much they can handle appleinsidernotes. one owner performed two different tests to see how it handled being dropped. the first had them dropping it from about face level. the second test had it dropped from a persons arms stretched as high as they could. the

resistant the new smartphone is reports bgr. a bend test of the device found that it doesnt bend in the same way as the iphone 00NUMBER00 does. however it did note that the adhesive around the screen

friday but that didnt stop one wall street pro from gushing about the investments prospects. bmo capital analyst tim long raised his price target on the stock from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. hes keeping his bullish outperform rating of course. hes encouraged by the commentary coming out of stateside carriers on initial iphone sales an important barometer because apple itself has announced that it wont be offering opening weekend iphone sales as it has in the past. a supply shortage particularly of the new jet black models and the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 plus will make it tricky to get an initial read on the iconic smartphones early success. carriers have been offering generous trade in offers and discounts on iphone products making a big deal out of an update that many feared would just be a placeholder until apple dramatically changes things in time for next years update. next years model will mark 00NUMBER00 years on the market and apple isnt likely to squander that round milestone. long feels that iphone sales will top expectations. hes also upbeat about the prospects for apple watch series 00NUMBER00 in the coming quarters. hardware upgrade cycles will be lumpy. apple investors know that all too well. they saw it rear its head when sales began to slip in the shadow of 00NUMBER00 iphone plus rollout. however long feels that apples services revenue which he expects to grow at a 00NUMBER00 annualized clip through at least 00NUMBER00 will provide more consistency to apples financial performance in the future. apple shares moved sharply higher in each of this past weeks first four trading days soaring 00NUMBER00 in the process. the stock took a 00NUMBER00 step back on friday but the trading still played out as a healthy 00NUMBER00 pop for the week. its a surprising move in light of the 00NUMBER00 hit the stock took a week earlier when it actually unveiled the iphone 00NUMBER00 and apple watch series 00NUMBER00. the market wasnt initially impressed but theres excitement now on wall street with some buzz building for the smartphone update and carriers are getting aggressive in trying to outfit customers with the pricey handsets. bmo capital isnt the only firm moving up to 00NUMBER00 as a near term stock goal. canaccord analyst t. michael walkley also boosted his price target going from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. his survey work is also showing that stateside carriers are finding success with their iphone promotions leading him to conclude that initial replacement sales are coming in better than expected. walkley is betting that future upgrade cycles will be even stronger. one can argue that long and walkley didnt have much of a choice here. apples stock has been on a tear since bottoming out in may soaring 00NUMBER00 to close at 00NUMBER00 on friday. long and walkley parked with price targets of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 didnt make sense on bullish ratings. the two analysts would have to either lower their ratings to more neutral settings or push up their stock price goals. theyre doing the right thing. the markets hot for apple again and wall street pros dont want to be on the wrong side of that bullish momentum.

reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. we dont know how many iphones applenasdaq aapl  is selling this weekend but we do know that investors were all over the stock leading up to fridays release of the latest generation of its iconic smartphone. shares of apple moved 00NUMBER00 higher last week fueled by bullish analyst notes aggressive u. s. carrier promotions and a growing consensus that the new product cycle may work out just fine for the consumer electronics giant. apples rally namely its 00NUMBER00 pop from monday to thursday before taking a small step back on friday was its heartiest four day spike in more than two years. the gains during that four day run were consistent up 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. theres excitement building for the updated device that improves the included storage battery life camera and processor of last years model. the controversial move to eliminate the headphone jack a necessary evil to make it dust and water resistant is turning heads and apparently getting folks to consider replacing their current smartphones. three of the four leading u. s. carriers chimed in to say that pre orders of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus were running ahead of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus a year earlier. on thursday apple announced that the initial supply of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 model had sold out worldwide. there were some field reports that lines at apple stores werent as long on friday morning as in years past but bullish analysts dismissed the relevance. with carriers doing a better job of reaching out to existing customers and the growing popularity of online ordering theres no longer the dire urgency to camp out at your local apple mall store. piper jaffrays gene munster one of the more vocal apple bulls over the years pointed out that the launch line at apples signature store in new york citys 00NUMBER00 avenue was just 00NUMBER00 patrons deep down from the 00NUMBER00 it counted at last years iphone 00NUMBER00 rollout and the prior years 00NUMBER00 who queued up for the iphone 00NUMBER00. we can dismiss the 00NUMBER00 frenzy since it coincided with the phones new form factor and the introduction of the larger plus line. well have to wait until next year when apple is widely expected to once again shake up the form factor of the iphone. munster isnt worried. he remains bullish. other analysts also checked in last week pushing their price targets higher. there may have been some initial concerns with the elimination of the headphone jack but that isnt getting in the way of early adopters from upgrading. the apple watch series 00NUMBER00 that the tech giant also unveiled earlier this month wont be as big a difference maker as the new iphone but it has enough updated features to win over new buyers. throw in the success that apple is having outside hardware from the growing acceptance of applepay as a payment platform to icloud storage to the apple music streaming platform with 00NUMBER00 million premium subscribers and the stock is a market darling again. it may not have any fresh numbers to reveal tomorrow the way it has following previous launch weekends but just because it has nothing to say isnt cause for concern. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest

market news stock advice trading tipsif there was an iphone 00NUMBER00 feature that was going to be a pr headache for apple inc. nasdaqaapl most people would have picked the decision to ax the headphone jack. while that move has been far from popular its now being overshadowed by complaints that the new iphones home button doesnt work with gloves even the special ones made for use with touchscreen devices. it also wont work with many waterproof and full screen protective cases. aapl made a big change with the iphone 00NUMBER00 home button. it left the button there and it looks the same as before but the physical mechanism is gone. instead the iphone 00NUMBER00 home button is solid state. theres no click it acts like a touchscreen and responds with haptic feedback. immediately after apples launch announcement there was grumbling about that feedback being unnatural. however it wasnt until the new iphone got into the wild that people starting picking up on the fact that the new home button appears to onlywork with direct skin contact. many gloves and full screen protectivewaterproof caseswont work with it. 00NUMBER00 growth stocks that will outrun googleso who cares if the iphone 00NUMBER00 is essentially incompatible with many waterproof cases after all water resistance is one of the big selling points of aapls new iphone. theres a difference between water resistantand waterproof however. a waterproof case lets you spend time underwater with a smartphone while water resistance provides protection to survive an accidental dunk. there are also specialized cases that offer full device protection including a touch compatible film over the home button. these are especially popular with outdoors enthusiasts people who work in physically demanding jobs and kids. some iphone users are going to be put out and case manufacturers will be scrambling to figure a way around this technical curveball. the bigger problem for most people may be the incompatibility with gloves. on the surface this sounds like a minor issue and if you live in a temperate climate it may be. but if you live anywhere that it gets cold in the winter like a large swath of north america its much more than that. an entire industry has grown up around gloves that can be used with touchscreens. they were the missing link as smartphones exploded in popularity and consumers discovered they couldnt use their new apps or even make a phone call without removing their gloves and exposing their bare hands to the freezing temperatures. the development of touchscreen friendly gloves with fingertips coated with a capacitive material was a big win for those living in northern climes. reports that many of these gloves dont work with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plusarent going over well. a longtime ios feature was ditched in ios 00NUMBER00 making the home button problem even worse. a side swipe of the iphone screen traditionally brings up the pass code entry screen to unlock the device bypassing touch id. if that were still the case iphone 00NUMBER00 users would be safe even in the winter. their touchscreen gloves would still let them swipe enter their passcode as usual and carry on. but in ios 00NUMBER00 apple ditched this feature relying on a home button click to either unlock using touch id or bring up the passcode screen. since the iphone 00NUMBER00 home button wont work with most gloves and many waterproof cases owners cant even get to the passcode screen. using the iphonesassistivetouch modecan be a workaround although its kludgey. apple may also release an ios 00NUMBER00 update if the outcry gets bad enough. apple inc. aapl how the iphone changed the world 00NUMBER00 years lateralso because some capacitive gloves apparently dowork with the iphone 00NUMBER00 home button glove designers will likely be able to figure out what works and what doesnt to produce new iphone 00NUMBER00 friendly versions. however that would mean new gloves for a lot of people and will take time. then again after ditching the iphone headphone jack aapl clearly doesnt have a big issue with nudging people into upgrading their accessories. as of

waters by using the same overall design for the third year all indications have been that demand is skyrocketing. apple thinks it will be so supply constrained that it didnt releaselaunch weekend figures today like it normally otherwise would have. iphones have always been supply constrained at launch but the company is suggesting that its worse than normal. carriers also reported robust preorderactivity last week. here are two potential reasons the iphone 00NUMBER00 is experiencing such high demand. the domestic carriers have all launched or matched promotions offering customers an iphone 00NUMBER00 for free when they trade in an iphone 00NUMBER00 or newer. while the carriers offer various types of promotions every year when new units are released in the autumn this one is particularly aggressive. the promotion essentially offers a 00NUMBER00 trade in value for any iphone 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 plus. thats enough to cover the cost of a base iphone 00NUMBER00. thats quite a generous offer for a base 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 thats two years old but less so for a fully loaded 00NUMBER00 gb iphone 00NUMBER00 plus from last year. the new dual camera system. image source apple. the catch is that the trade in value promotion is spread out over the course of two years in order to create lock in. you also have to pay extra if you want the 00NUMBER00 plus andor more storage. regardless the carriers continue to poach customers from each other and it seems that every year the promotions are getting increasingly aggressive. apple is the biggest beneficiary here. youve probably heard something about those exploding samsung phones by now. the challenge for samsung is that its smartphone brands arent meaningfully differentiated so the current crisis with the exploding galaxy note 00NUMBER00 is also likely dragging down sales of other flagship devices as well. that could potentially include the galaxy 00NUMBER00 as well as the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge. the south korean conglomerates efforts to outdo apple have backfired badly rushing the galaxy note 00NUMBER00 to market prematurely at a time when apple is already enjoying high levels of android switchers. giving up the headphone jack seems like a small price to pay to be confident that your phone wont set your car on fire. samsung is stumbling through an official recall as we speak but the damage to its brand will be lasting. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts

recorded on sept. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewiswelcome to industry focus the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. its friday september 00NUMBER00 and were recapping applesevent from last week. im your host dylan lewis and im joined on skype by foolcoms senior technology specialist evan niu. evan hows it going evan niupretty good its iphone day. lewisiphone day yes. so apples anticipated press event went down last week on the 00NUMBER00. they are now going to actually go on sale. so people are getting their hands on the phones today. some interesting news coming out of that. but this is the cupertino companys latest update to the iphone line. theyre calling it the 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 plus. i know theres some speculation there. given that the iphone line accounts for about 00NUMBER00 apples revenue it fluctuates quarter to quarter tech insiders and investors alike are eagerly anticipating this unveiling and see what the next generation device looks like. so why dont we hop right in what does the new line offer users niui think its pretty modest and incremental. every year its getting more and more incremental just because smartphones are so good nowadays that its hard to really make them that much better. the improvements a few years ago used to be so mind blowing that its like yeah you have to upgrade if you care about it. but im actually skipping this year for the first time in eight years which is weird for me just because i dont think its that compelling. so far the early indications look pretty strong in terms of. . . again the lines at the stores you have the carriers announcing a lot of good strong activities. theres a lot of positive sentiment right now around this device even though it seems in my opinion a little incremental. i dont think the improvements all that great. lewisi think one of the biggest and probably got the most press in terms of features or changes was the removal of the headphone jack. definitely one of the more controversial elements of the new phone. apple decided to shift consumers toward wireless connections using bluetooth and things like that. and of course theyre offering 00NUMBER00 airpods to help ease that pain. but the new phones will be shipping with a lightning port adapter that will allow people to plug in their headphones. it seemed like the removal of the headphone jack was really something that enabled them to up the processing power improve the battery life make some camera improvements. it was a form factor decision that help to them juice the guts of the phone itself. niuyeah. its just apples same thing of identifying that some technology standard is outdated. and the headphone jack is 00NUMBER00 plus years old. so of all the standards theyve killed in the past this is one of the oldest ones. arguably its kind of surprising but they havent done it already. but every time they do this they get a bunch of crap and people dont like it. but the market always survives. and yeah theres always these big ecosystems that are built around these ports of standard. but at the same time theyre the only company that does this that pushes the industry forward in this way because all the other companies are too afraid to make these controversial decisions. this is not a new thing for apple. they have done this for the past four years and every time they do it its controversial. you can see both sides. just like every other time theyve done it theres two sides. everyones like hey i want to still be able to use all my stuff. but then if you look forward into the trajectory of audio connectivity yeah bluetooth like you mentioned is getting a lot better especially with bluetooth low energy. its just kind of like analog going to digital. the lightning audio is a digital connection versus the headphone jack which is an analog connection. its just one of those things that probably needs to happen eventually and apple is making the leap now. and theres even suggestions now they actually just sent out a survey to their users asking if people use headphone jacks on their laptops. so theyre obviously thinking about killing it on the laptop eventually which isnt surprising. but for peoples computers there are people who plug in their home audio and computer speakers in there too in addition to headphones. its an even bigger ecosystem of devices that you would have to try to transition somehow versus on a smartphone. its just headphones versus speakers. its pretty big change its one of the bigger ones. lewisyeah. to quote apple it definitely takes courage to make a decision like that. i know as someone with a nice set of bose headphones that are not wireless. . . niuyeah like these. lewisyeah. im going to need to use that adapter. like i said they will ship with the phones. one of the criticisms is that unless you use a different type of adapter you wont be able to charge and listen to music at the same time. some of the other big things with this product release they introduced water resistance. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus can be submerged under three feet of water for 00NUMBER00 minutes. thats the benchmark that theyre using there. apple is not the first company to do this. samsungpretty heavily promotes their water resistant products. so just an interesting thing. i know that they deal with a lot of water damaged products and i dont believe that water damage will be covered under warranty. niuthats true. the funny thing about the waterproofing thing is that last years iphone was actually surprisingly waterproof. there are test videos from last year of people putting iphones into a bowl of water for literally an hour. they time lapsed it. and it still works. they would check every 00NUMBER00 minutes or so. so i think they had made a lot of progress last year but if you market it people are going to do it and if theyre disappointed youre in a hot spot. so i think that what they did is start this process last year didnt tell anyone about it because they didnt want to invite people to test it even though of course people tested it anyway another felt more confident with the changes they did this year with making it even more sealed. so now theyre touting it as a big thing but its actually something i think they started last year or maybe even the year before that. lewisyeah i think thats a feature thats better to surprise consumers with than have them expect it and not quite deliver on it. so thats something you can look forward to if you were thinking about upgrading. the phones also tout a longer battery life i believe its an extra two hours for the iphone 00NUMBER00 over the iphone 00NUMBER00 and i believe its an extra one hour over the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus over the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. niui think thats a big achievement because i think most of that is coming from this 00NUMBER00 fusion processor with its greater efficiency. i cant remember the numbers but i think the battery is a little bit bigger. but the majority of that gain is probably coming from efficiency gains on the power side of the processor because theyre finally doing this process or architecture that has the two powerful cores plus the two little cores which is similar to something arm used to do called big. little. but this implementation is not exactly that this one is much more sophisticated. but the concept is you use these low power cores when you have low power tasks and you save a ton of energy. i think its a huge testament to how far apples chip team has come. its crazy that theyve come this far and theyre now one of the most sophisticated process makers in the world. and their first proprietary chip was in 00NUMBER00. so were talking about six years. the 00NUMBER00 was the first one in 00NUMBER00. and now theyre at this insane level where theyre basically. . . the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is basically stronger than a macbook air. lewisthats incredible. niuin six years theyve done this. its really mind blowing. and they dont get much credit. its weird because they dont talk about this very much. lewisyeah i think they tend to focus on the very visible features and form factor elements of the product. to give you an idea of what the performance numbers look like from generation to generation the 00NUMBER00 chip is approximately 00NUMBER00 faster than the 00NUMBER00 which is what they used to power the 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 chip is twice as fast as the 00NUMBER00 which powered the iphone 00NUMBER00. youre definitely getting a pretty good performance boost there. that and the battery life are two of the really big elements that you might not notice right away just looking at the product but once you start really using it youll start to feel it. theyre also touting some new camera systems. the 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 plus both support 00NUMBER00 megapixel cameras. but i think one of the more noticeable things as well is the base level storage. this is something that ive been expecting for a while. i was kind of thinking they might do it with the 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 line runs 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 of storage. thats up from the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 on the iphone 00NUMBER00. theyve also decided to increase the storage of new 00NUMBER00 phones to be in line with that. so if youre buying a new 00NUMBER00 you can get it and the base level will be 00NUMBER00. i think that makes sense. i know were moving to a lot of cloud storage but its nice to have some extra space on their particularly if youre a metro commuter and youre in a lot of areas where youll be offline. i know that i always appreciate that. niuits weird because i was always one of the few people that actually liked the 00NUMBER00 model purely from an investing standpoint because its so bad for consumers that its actually really good for investors if that makes sense. 00NUMBER00 is really so insufficient that you have to upgrade to the mid tier 00NUMBER00 at a minimum which boosts your revenue average selling price and all this. so from an investment standpoint i was actually a huge fan even though from a consumer standpoint its pretty bad and annoying because its so insufficient. but now with this 00NUMBER00 its a harder call because people will have to ask. . . before it was like theres no way you could get away with 00NUMBER00 thats just a joke. but now with 00NUMBER00 maybe i could. you have to actually think about the decision do you spend the extra 00NUMBER00 to go to 00NUMBER00 or can you actually stick with 00NUMBER00 so i think itll be interesting to see what happens with asps going forward. but at the same time they just introduced se which starts at 00NUMBER00 and that already puts pretty big downward pressure on asps in general. lewisyeah maybe the logic there was the se is going to fill that niche and make it a little bit easier. i know when i got the 00NUMBER00 wasnt even a consideration. i want for the 00NUMBER00 model. niuexactly right and you knew apple made another 00NUMBER00. lewisjust to bring it around to prices because we talked about asp average selling price the iphone 00NUMBER00 will start at 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 plus will start at 00NUMBER00. thats the starting point there. niuthats interesting too because theyre bumping the 00NUMBER00 plus by an extra 00NUMBER00. it used to just be 00NUMBER00 more and now its 00NUMBER00 more. i tend to think that the extra 00NUMBER00 that theyre charging is related to the camera system. that camera system is expensive. lewisand the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has a two lens camera now whereas in the past there was just one. the 00NUMBER00 maintains the one lens camera. certainly some added features there and a little bit of extra stuff under the hood so to speak. so i think that makes sense. the company predictably took some flak for its decision to ditch the headphone jack like we talked about and questionable use of the word courage throughout the presentation. but the stock is up 00NUMBER00 the last 00NUMBER00 days. for a company apples size thats pretty noteworthy. any time you see something like that i think its less to do with the product specs and more to do with whats going on with pre order information that weve seen from a couple different outlets. some of the different wireless carriers announced what they were seeing in terms of pre order activity. t mobile said the two new iphones have shattered previous sales records. i believe orders are coming in at something like 00NUMBER00 what the iphone 00NUMBER00 did. sprint also saw very high pre order numbers. they said orders were up 00NUMBER00 over the first three days of pre order availability compared to last year. att and verizon were a bit more muted in what they were talking about related to the iphone line and said that pre orders were pretty much business as usual business as expected. niui think att said at a conference the other day that they were just above expectations. still pretty vague. lewisyeah. some really nice color from t mobile and sprint not so much att and verizon. but i cant say that im surprised were seeing some really good pre orders. 00NUMBER00. its an iphone and 00NUMBER00. the wireless carriers most of them i think all four of them have gone with the free iphone 00NUMBER00. so its tough to parse out how much of that is what would be a full price purchase iphone versus a free iphone thats coming with an upgrade and a two year commitment to that wireless provider. so thats the grain of salt that you need to take with any of those pre order numbers. niulike you said the stock has been up 00NUMBER00 or so over the past few days. and i think thats interesting because its on heavy volume. if you look at the volume activity the gain is on in the back theres a lot of volume. theres a lot of people coming in its not a light volume move. theres a lot of people that are coming into the stock on all this iphone 00NUMBER00 is kind of ironic because theres basically this idea theres a sentiment that iphone 00NUMBER00 is going to be strong the carrier stuff you mentioned. but the irony is apple has been trying really hard to shift away from focusing so much on unit sales numbers which is also partly why i think theyre not going to release their launch weekend sales for the first time in five plus years. theyve always announced launch figures every year but this year they said theyre not going to. lewisyeah i believe a company spokesperson said and im actually taking this from an article you wrote these initial sales will be governed by supply not demand and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers. niuthe silly part about that is that thats been true every year. lewisyeah thats always the case. niui dont really believe their reasoning for why theyre saying it because there has always been supply constraints. every year its supply constraint. thats not a new thing. so them saying theyre not going to give this number because of that i think thats kind of a cop out. i think its part of the broader strategy to get people to stop focusing on unit sales because what they want people to focus on particularly investors is to look at these recurring revenue sources. theyve been touting all this installed base purchases and services revenue and all these things that are not tied to unit sales. theyre trying to get investors to focus on those numbers instead of unit sales. but obviously investors are still focused on unit sales because when you hear all these positive storylines about the iphone 00NUMBER00 they go out and buy the stock. also combine this with the fact that the samsung note 00NUMBER00 are exploding that also help. so i think theres a lot of positivity around the iphone 00NUMBER00 the fact that apple is trying to shift the focus away from how many units they sell. lewisyeah. i think youre absolutely right. you look at the way their revenue mix is going its going to play out that way. like i said earlier the iphone contribution to revenue was in the past about two thirds. i believe it was down to about 00NUMBER00 of their most recent quarter and thats because of that rising service revenue. you also have the introduction of the watch line and things like that which they updated in this most recent press event. but yeah the iphone while its going to be the cash cow for them i think theyre making efforts to highlight other parts of the business. this recent rise that we talked about actually pushes apple above a 00NUMBER00 pe on a trailing basis for the first time in a year. niuooh so expensive laughs lewisyeah right its kind of insane. but looking at how all of this fits into where the business is going last quarter the company guided for revenue between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. and even if they dramatically beat that guidance which theyve typically been in the high end of their guidance range or slightly above it they will likely fall short of previous years number for the third straight quarter. i believe last year ago quarter the fourth fiscal quarter they were around 00NUMBER00 billion just to give you an idea of how different the guidance is there. its tough to keep seeing this. the product is really successful. customer satisfaction was really great. they just keep going up against these really tough comps. eventually thats going to change but dont expect that trajectory to be any different for the next couple quarters. i think thats one of the key things investors need to keep in mind here. youre going to probably see year over year declines for this quarter next quarter possibly even three quarters out. niui think theres a chance the iphone 00NUMBER00 generally speaking regardless of the time. . . the timing for the year over year comps is always tricky because its always really dependent on when they launched the phone. in this case theyre launching the phone with two or three weeks left to the quarter. last year i think they had just a couple days. so the launch timing really has a big impact on how much of that launch gets captured in which quarter. but in general i think theres a chance that the 00NUMBER00 could push the cycle up. the sense is iphone unit sales have picked because theyve been flat ish roughly over the past year year over year or whatever. but if you look every two years they basically pushed higher because of the cycle this two year design cycle of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 etc. so the performance of the sales at least for the past two major product cycles they tend to go in tandem. because if most people upgrade their phones every two years and all the people who upgraded for the 00NUMBER00 are probably all going to upgrade for the 00NUMBER00 they had this pattern of going in pairs. who knows if that actually plays out again this year because the sales are so high that is hard to really grow. but i think theres a possibility particularly with all the kinds of indications that were seeing. but i wouldnt bet on it. im just saying its like a curveball its possible. lewisweve talked in the past about the idea of two year comps being a bit more relevant for apple because of the update cycle that theyre on. i think as you talked about before their refreshes on the product become more incremental and less major step changes then i start to look at them more on a year over year basis. to your point about releases another important thing to remember here is all the numbers that apple will be reporting for fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 only two weeks of that period will have the iphone 00NUMBER00 available. it will be a part of those numbers but it will not be a major contributor. youre going to really want to look at fiscal 00NUMBER00 calendar 00NUMBER00 for what its going to be doing for the financial statements. im sure were going to get some commentary in the company call come fiscal 00NUMBER00. but thats something to keep in mind. niuand its weird because this is the first time theyve ever pushed a three year design cycle. itll be really interesting to see how that changes the performance. theyve never done a three year design cycle before. and its also a testament to smartphones getting more mature. its kind of like laptops. they redesign laptops every four to five years but they would redesign their phones every two years. so now youre seeing they feel comfortable that they can push that limit on the design side. but then the real question is what happens next year because everyone is expecting a new design next year maybe another display maybe no home button maybe curb display whatever. then it just throws everything out of whack the fact that theyre changing the timing of these cycles. its going to be cool to see what happens going forward. and plus what are they going to call it they cant call it the 00NUMBER00 if they change the design altogether. lewiseventually theyre going to have to ditch that naming convention one way or another. niuive been saying they should ditch that thing for years. this is the iphone 00NUMBER00. its the 00NUMBER00 iphone. and what next year itll be the iphone 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00 iphone it just makes no sense. lewisyeah. i think to bring it back around and what to watch for here if the product incremental upgrades that we talked about some of their performance changes are visible enough to people that maybe currently hold an iphone 00NUMBER00 or the offers from these wireless carriers look compelling enough i think you could see some really great numbers for fiscal 00NUMBER00 which will be calendar 00NUMBER00. but you wont get a report on that for quite a bit. be wary of that and know that any really big enthusiasm is going to come through more on the companys call than in the numbers that the company reports next quarter. anything else on this thats kind of investing take away. obviously everything that they delivered here was what wed been expecting from pre launch leaks and rumors. niuyeah. everything pretty much came in right on target with expectations as far as the product specs and things like that. i think the watch 00NUMBER00 looks ok its kind of the same thing watch 00NUMBER00 like what they should have done with the first one. i dont think many people are going to upgrade from the watch 00NUMBER00 to the watch 00NUMBER00. it just doesnt seem very compelling. but maybe they get more first time adopters that were on the fence about watch 00NUMBER00 and didnt do it but now watch 00NUMBER00 is more compelling a stronger product so maybe the people that were on the fence will jump in and go ahead and be a first time buyer for the smartwatch. and of course once they do that theyre on this upgrade track and theyre going to eventually upgrade however long who knows. lewisyeah you have the chance to win over those people who dont want to own a first generation device with the watch basically. niuright. i think the watch 00NUMBER00 does look compelling in that sense. of course theres no detailed results to compare to because apple wont give them to us. but just generally i think products just get better over time. next month theyre supposed to have these new macbook pros which might reinvigorate the mac lineup. that lineup has been there for four years. so coming out with a new thing there could really juice the mac performance for the next few years. lewiscertainly more to watch

industry is on track to post back to back annual revenue growth for the first time since 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 thanks to the thriving online streaming business models developed by services like spotify and apples aaplapple music. according to a report from the recording industry association of america riaa obtained by bloomberg news retail spending on recorded music grew 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion in the first half of 00NUMBER00. after years of slumping revenues due to piracy and declining prices streaming has finally helped the music business get back on track. u. s. streaming revenue grew 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion in the first half of the year which represents nearly half of the industrys total sales. paid for subscription services are leading the growth as more and more people are signing up for monthly streaming plans that actually make the industry some money. not surprisingly music purchases continued to decline. sales of physical music including cds and vinyl fell 00NUMBER00 in the first two quarters while music downloads also fell by a double digit percentage. the source of revenues isnt the only major industrial change that streaming has made. artists must now consider signing exclusive release deals with the likes of apple music and tidal forcing potential customers to pick their service based on its roster of signees. we also know that ad supported services are struggling to convince users to switch to paid subscriptions of spotifys 00NUMBER00 million monthly users just over a third pay for an account. nevertheless exclusively paid for services like apple music are growing amazingly fast. just a year after its launch apples music service has over 00NUMBER00 million subscribers. for more coverage on the state of the music

its watches as it is for its bank accounts. the industry exports about 00NUMBER00 billion worth of swiss watches per year and beyond the economic implications swiss watches are a great source of national pride. but the industry has been falling on hard times recently with exports seemingly in free fall. swiss watch exports totaled just 00NUMBER00 million in august down 00NUMBER00 according to the federation of the swiss watch industry. in financial terms sales fell nearly 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion swiss francs. bloombergnotes that this is the 00NUMBER00 consecutive month of declines. well it just so happens that thats just about how long apple watch has been on the market. applenasdaq aapl is almost certainly a contributing factor. the original apple watch launched at the end of april 00NUMBER00. like most apple product launches the device was severely supply constrained initially. it wasnt until june 00NUMBER00 that apples production really ramped and started to catch up with demand. that was 00NUMBER00 months ago. data source federation of the swiss watch industry. chart compiled by bloomberg. annotations added by author. meanwhile at the iphonewatch series 00NUMBER00 product event earlier this month tim cook noted that apple quickly rose within the ranks of watch industry following the launch of apple watch. the company is now the no. 00NUMBER00 watchmaker in the world as measured by revenue. image source gfycat. to be clear there is a host of reasons why the swiss watch export industry has been suffering. the swiss franc has been relatively strong as a currency which hurts exports. china and hong kong have historically been very important markets but the weakening yuan is hurting import demand at a time when consumers are shifting purchases toward experiences instead of tangible products. the industry is also realizing that it needs to target more affordable price points while also catering to a younger demographic that is more tech savvy. the values of traditional timepieces dont depreciate in the way that smartwatches do since the underlying technology hasnt changed for hundreds of years. even apple has realized that no one wants to buy a 00NUMBER00 smartwatch. swiss watchmakers are facing a wide range of headwinds and apples entry isnt helping. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech

first time around applenasdaq aapl helped the music industry navigate the digital transition. the challenge in the late 00NUMBER00 that the industry faced was the rise of piracy as digital files of music were easily copied and shared illegally. apples role was to help consumers come to terms will opening up their wallets in a digital world in part by making it easier to buy digital music legally. this time around the mac maker is helping the music industry navigate the streaming transition. the challenge now is that the early innings were dominated by ad supported models where users more or less got to listen for free. the basic goal remains the same convince consumers that music is still worth paying for. the riaa has released its midyear 00NUMBER00 reportlink opens pdf on industry revenue and revenue from subscription services is helping the industry grow despite falling unit sales of both physical and digital copies. retail revenue rose 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 billion putting up the best growth in decades. notably streaming subscription revenue accounted for nearly half 00NUMBER00 of that total. streaming revenue is driving growth of digital music revenue while permanent downloads are relatively flat. image source riaa. meanwhile ad supported on demand streaming has stagnated. this is the part of the market that the industry has always hated since not only is the revenue modest but it cheapens the value that consumers place on music in general. consumers expecting to get music for free if they endure ads is not a good thing for the viability of the industry. image source riaa. however apple isnt alone in helping to transform the industry. spotify is by far the biggest player when it comes to paid subscriptions with 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers. thats more than twiceapples 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers. data sources apple and spotify. chart by author. but the big difference is that spotify still offers an ad supported on demand service while simultaneously offering a paid subscription that includes a wide range of additional features such as unlimited skips and offline listening. spotify hit 00NUMBER00 million total active users in june meaning it has convinced roughly 00NUMBER00 of its user base to pay up for premium. on the other hand apple onlyoffers a paid version after a three month free trial. thats a strategic decision that has undoubtedly won the mac maker many friends within the music industry. apple and spotify both sit at the same price points with individual and family plans at least if you dont subscribe to spotify through the app. paying subscribers now pay 00NUMBER00 per year which is far more than the average person previously spent on music annually in the pre streaming era. more importantly consumers now get a lot more for their money. instead of adding a few albums a year people have access to more music than they could possibly need. this probably wont be the last time that apple helps usher in a new model for the music industry. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the

aaplappeared first oninvestorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple ceo tim cook at wwdc 00NUMBER00. image source apple. todays big applenasdaq aapl story is that the company has approached famed british supercar maker mclaren for a potential acquisition or collaboration of some sort. this comes from financial times citing anonymous sources that say talks began a few months back. mclaren is valued in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion and operates at a loss. mclaren has quite a bit of institutional knowledge that apple might want to get its hands on such as materials design and other areas of automotive manufacturing. heres why a potential deal does and doesnt make sense. acqui hiring automotive talent makes sense in accelerating apples automotive road map and development plans. while the company has been poaching plenty of automotive engineers from the industry an acqui hire of this size would significantly bolster the talent under its roof. mclarens valuation is also manageable and a deal could probably be done for less than what apple spent on beats its largest historical acquisition to date. ceo tim cook has said openly that he wont be stopped from making deals based on price alone anymore provided that the deal is a good strategic and cultural fit. mclaren is a quintessential premium brand much like apple as its vehicles often sell for 00NUMBER00 million and greater. since mclaren is based in the u. k. apple would also probably be able to fund the deal with its substantial foreign reserves making better use of that idle cash. apples preference with acquisitions is often to shut down the business redeploying products and technologies in its own lineup. most of the time these revenue streams are negligible enough that no one really notices. mclaren reportedly generated nearly 00NUMBER00 million in revenue last year and produced about 00NUMBER00 cars. if apple chose to shut down mclarens existing operations that would be quite a bit of lost revenue. it could also mean potentially killing one of the most famous supercar brands in the world. that level of volume also shows that mclaren wouldnt have much expertise in manufacturing cars in high volumes which would be a requisite for the apple car. manufacturing cars at scale is easily the hardest aspect of competing in the auto industry and apple still needs to figure out how to tackle that problem given its complete lack of experience and aversion to in house manufacturing. apples secretive car efforts are undoubtedly electric in nature while mclarens supercars all use traditional internal combustion technology. so there would be little value to apple in mclarens underlying propulsion technology. and mclaren certainly has no expertise in autonomy either. but mclaren could still provide expertise in aerodynamic engineering and materials knowledge which are quite important in electric cars due to the implications on range. there are plenty of pros and cons in this potential deal but my bet is that it doesnt happen. a secret billion

racing car maker. image source mclaren technology groupapplenasdaq aapl has approached mclaren technology group a british maker of high end sports cars and owner of a formula one racing team about a potential acquisition according to a new reportin the financial times. according to the report which cites three unnamed people briefed on the negotiations apple is considering either a strategic investment in or an outright takeover of mclaren. talks between the two companies have been ongoing for several months the report said. mclaren is likely to be valued at between 00NUMBER00 billion pounds 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion pounds 00NUMBER00 billion the report said. that would make it apples biggest acquisition since it paid 00NUMBER00 billion for beats electronics and beats music. beats turned out to be the foundation of a significant new offering apple music. the obvious conclusion to draw is that mclaren would somehow factor into apples long rumored effort to develop a car. but howlets answer this first. mclaren is a privately held company with three principal business unitsmclaren racing operates the successful mclaren formula one auto racing team. formula one is generally regarded as the highest level of auto racing team budgets are huge and the cars incorporate a great deal of cutting edge technology. mclaren automotive manufactures a small range of luxury sports cars with prices that start at about 00NUMBER00 and can hit seven figures. it produced 00NUMBER00 vehicles last year. mclaren applied technologies is a contract engineering company with expertise in high performance auto engineering on board computer systems and manufacturing with advanced materials like carbon fiber. it has worked with a long list of companies inside and outside of the auto industry. well apple is probably not looking to go racing. and seven figure sports cars arent really in line with the apple brand. but its not hard to see how mclarens expertise in developing and manufacturing road cars that incorporate a lot of advanced racing derived technology could play a big role in apples long rumored effort to develop a car. according to the financial timesreport apple is interested in mclarens technology engineering expertise and patent portfolio. mclarens expertise includes some kinds of expertise that are hard to come by in silicon valley a deep understanding of how to design and tune automotive suspension systems for instance. that kind of expertise might be what apple is really seeking here. officially apple hasnt even acknowledged that its trying to develop a car so its hard to say for sure. some including your humble fool have speculated that apples real intention may be to create a self driving car service a premium apple quality automated competitor to ride hailing companies like uber and lyft that would be integrated into apples technology ecosphere. reports have suggested that the program has made a significant shift in recent months from an effort to develop a complete electric vehicle led by now departed executive steve zadesky to a more limited project focused on the development of systems to power a self driving car under longtime apple veteran bob mansfield. longtime apple watchers have questioned whether that shift actually happened as it would mean that the company is moving away from its usual approach of controlling both the hardware and the software in its devices. but as always with the highly secretive apple its possible that something else entirely is going on an acquisition of mclaren would suggest that apple might be focused on a complete car after all. whenever apple is ready to tell us. that might be in another year or two or it might be never if the company decides against bringing a product to market. thats not the answer that apple investors want to hear of course. but if nothing else the report of apples interest in mclaren suggests that the project is still alive in some form. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small

00NUMBER00 with 00NUMBER00 gigabytes of on board flash memory costs the company about 00NUMBER00 to build. whenever these estimates come out critics are quick to point out that apple is making obscene or ridiculous profits from these devices. in response individuals will point out that there is far more to the cost of building an iphone than the sum of the components that go into the device. but while i agree that the per unit manufacturing costs referred to as cost of goods sold consist of more than just the raw components i often see people include research and development expense as a component of the cost of goods sold for a particular iphone. that would be a mistake. hardly anyone would argue that it costs apple a pretty penny to design each iphone. apple develops a significant number of unique and proprietary technologies such as all of the software and services present on the device not to mention all of the tools that apple creates for app developers custom chiptechnologies the display and much more. however its important to understand that these are one time expenses referred to as non recurring engineering or nre costs. in other words apple does all of the hard work and spends significantly to develop these technologies but these expenses are incurred just once. from an accounting perspective research and development costs arent generally counted under cost of goods sold and therefore have no impact on gross profit margins revenue less the manufacturing costs associated with the sale of a product. instead theyre reported specifically as a separate line item still a critical component of a companys overall operating expenses. from an accounting and reporting perspective there is a good reason to keep rd expenses separate from cost of goods sold. remember that all of the expenses incurred to develop a product such as the iphone happens well in advance of when the first unit rolls off the assembly lines. furthermore by the time an iphone goes up for sale apple is already hard at work on the next several versions. so lets say that from an accounting perspective apple tries to include the rd spending in the actual manufacturing cost of each iphone it sells. doing so would present significant challenges. first of all apple would need to meticulously keep track of the spending associated with each project. given that apple is likely to be working at any time on multiple generations of products and technologies this would indeed be verydifficult. then even if apples financial teams were able to accurately determine the spending on a per product basis how would the company report all of the spending thats happening in support of future projects how does spending on products that never actually make it to market get accounted forit would be a complicated untenable mess. but wait theres more when it comes to nre expenses any potential per unit cost calculation would depend on the number of units shipped over the lifetime of the product higher unit shipments mean lower per unit costs as the fixed cost is spread over a greater number of units. and the number of units shipped is impossible to know before the very last unit of a particular product line ships out to end customers. for apple an iphone model can remain on sale for years. gross profit margin is a useful metric. it provides insight into a companys manufacturing cost structure and perhaps more importantly a companys competitive positioning in its field which is why its usually worthwhile to compare the gross margins of companies in similar industries not across different ones. however a better metric one that encompasses both gross profit margin as well as operating expenses is operatingmargin. this metric is calculated by taking gross profit subtracting operating expenses and dividing by total revenue. remember that even if a company has a good cost structure with respect to product manufacturing it still needs to develop and market those products. if those product development and marketing expenses get out of hand then all of the supply chain wizardry in the world will not be enough to sustain a healthy profitable business. when all is said and done apples operating margin in the past fiscal year was just over 00NUMBER00. what that means is that for every dollar the company brought in 00NUMBER00 fell to the bottom line a respectable figure especially since apple operates in very competitive markets. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

apple aapl and its automotive efforts as it looks for the next big revenue generator after the iphone. initially rumored for a 00NUMBER00 release date its recent efforts may suggest that the car may be coming a lot sooner than we think. recent reports suggest the cupertino calif. based apple has explored talks to acquire british super car company mclaren. it may also be in talks to acquire lit motors a san francisco based company working on building a electric self balacing motorcycle. by speaking to outside partners with established infrastructure and products that suggests apple is intent on staying ahead of competition in the space. known as project titan apple is working on building its own electric vehicle to compete with tesla chevrolet google uber and others for a market thats still forming. apple is reported to have brought back former executive bob mansfield to helm the project after some earlier turmoil. recently some key employees like the project lead steve zadesky moved on from the company. several of apples executives including phil schiller and eddy cue have an affinity for cars. in 00NUMBER00 apples marketing chief phil schiller tweeted his affinity for 00NUMBER00 racing including a specific mention of mclaren. cue who heads up apples internet software and services is on the board of ferrari. a study from bloomberg new energy finance states that electric vehicles will comprise 00NUMBER00 of the global new car sales by 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million vehicles or 00NUMBER00 times greater than what it was in 00NUMBER00. no other electronics market on the planet compares to the smartphone market in unit size as over 00NUMBER00 billion smartphones are sold every year. however the automotive industry which is slated to sell approximately 00NUMBER00 million new vehicles this year dwarfs the smartphone market in revenue. according to ibisworld the global car market is a 00NUMBER00 trillion industry growing around 00NUMBER00 per year. despite never having publicly acknowledged its car project apple ceo tim cook has hinted at it in the past. when asked by a shareholder at the companys february shareholder meeting cook responded in a coy manner. do you remember when you were a kid and christmas eve it was so exciting you weren’t sure what was going to be downstairs well it’s going to be christmas eve for a while. couple cooks

2016-09-23 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.2517465117474569,0.2076492083676459,0.0003067392366868,yesterday news broke that apple aapl may be interested in acquiring hyper car manufacturer and formula one team mclaren. when apple bought beats headphones it made sense. but apple looking at mclaren on the surface its a bit of a head scratcher. lets dig in a little bit to explore why on earth apple would want to do this. first a little about mclaren. founder bruce mclaren was a race car driver and engineer who developed his own formula one car in may 00NUMBER00. it wasnt until 00NUMBER00 that mclaren made its first road car the iconic mclaren 00NUMBER00. in 00NUMBER00 the mclaren technology center was built in surrey england and since then the company has gone on to build some of the fastest most beautiful super cars in the world beginning with the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. they also happen to be one of the most successful marques in formula one racing history. mclaren knows how to build cars. their engineers have found unique ways to put mind boggling capabilities in the hands of regular car owners while saving them from killing themselves. try giving a suburban dentist 00NUMBER00 hp and setting him loose on the street without driver assists like traction and stability control. itd be like watching mustangs leave car shows. then theres the mclaren factory itself. its less an auto plant and more a biotech manufacturing facility. youd think they were making surgical grade implants there. every room is set to a precise 00NUMBER00 degrees celsius and every screw is vertical so the heads wont collect dust. its a white glove sterile automated operation with advanced technologies found nowhere else in the world. just listen to how mclaren describes its own factory. conventional architecture was unable to find an elegant solution capable of supporting the mtcs magnificent glass faã§ade. thats a pickup line right there if i ever heard one. girl conventional fashion was unable to find an elegant solution capable of supporting that. . . as for the potential deal with apple there are plenty of synergies both business wise and culturally. the automation the engineering not to mention a potential tax advantage for apple with mclaren being headquartered overseas. the company makes phones and tablets. creating a car is an entirely different animal. by acquiring a company like mclaren apple could solidify itself as a major player in the autonomous car space. better move fast as self driving vehicles are already being tested on the streets of pittsburg. so is the imaclaren right around the corner apple is sitting on 00NUMBER00 billion in cash while mclaren is valued at around 00NUMBER00 billion. meaning apple has enough money to buy mclaren 00NUMBER00 times over right now. the deal makes sense just as long as apple doesnt change the special sauce at mclaren. theyve got to do something to find growth. weve got them as a zacks rank 00NUMBER00 hold right now because analysts havent been able to make up their minds. nine analysts have upped their estimates for how much money they think apple is going to make this year while six analysts have dropped their numbers. the result is our zacks consensus estimate for the current year is the same as it was 00NUMBER00 days ago stuck on 00NUMBER00. the stocks been on a run along with the rest of the market though. today its trading near 00NUMBER00 after dipping to the low 00NUMBER00 during the summer. the huge move in early september broke out through resistance at 00NUMBER00. every time you share this video i get a little bit closer to that 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 ive been dreaming about. chime in the comments section below and tell me if you think its a good idea for apple to buy mclaren. subscribe to the youtube channel twitter bartosiastics and come back here for all the trending stocks with zackscom im dave bartosiak. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc. ,669,-0.010718,0.0911808669656203,0.0298953662182361,0.5061728395061729,0.0119581464872944,0.0044843049327354,0.4545454545454545,2016,-0.0008138814999999,-0.0021237106666666,5.2760355174541473e-05,27.14914464494835

a german research firm suggested weak iphone 00NUMBER00 sales and japanese regulators are reportedly considering taking action against the tech giant over alleged antitrust violations. as reported bybusiness insider german research firm has issued a report suggesting that iphone 00NUMBER00 sales are weaker than what analysts expected and down considerably from last year based on data from asia and europe. the report apparently claims that iphone 00NUMBER00 unit sales are down 00NUMBER00 on an annual basis against last years iphone 00NUMBER00 model although it does not measure sales in the united states. and earlier this month apple said it would not be disclosing any iphone 00NUMBER00 launch numbers stating initial sales will be governed by supply not demand and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers. this goes against tradition so to speak as apple has historically released numbersfor its latest iphone release the monday after the first weekend a new model becomes available for sale. in other news apple may soon face a probe from japans fair trade commission ftc on claims over possible antitrust violations that may have helped it dominate the nations smartphone sales government sources said saysreuters. reutersalso notes that the apple iphone accounts for almost one in every two smartphones in japan and if these regulators decide to take any action against the company apples profit margins and hinder demand for its latest iphone model. currently aapl is a 00NUMBER00 hold on the zacks rank and has gained

of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. there are now more than 00NUMBER00 million people subscribing to the big three on demand streaming music platforms. spotify announced this month that it has 00NUMBER00 million subscribers just after applenasdaq aapl announced that apple music has 00NUMBER00 million subscribers. earlier this year tidal said it had 00NUMBER00 million subscribers. other high profile streaming services such as youtube red havent released any official subscriber numbers. but the fastest growing of all the popular on demand streaming platforms is also the largest and oldest. spotify added 00NUMBER00 million new subscribers in the period from march to september. apple by comparison added somewhere between 00NUMBER00 million and 00NUMBER00 million in that same period. the growth of on demand music subscriptions is eating away at apples itunes revenue and apple plans to make up that lost revenue and more with apple music. spotifys popularity represents a much bigger loss to apple than a bit of music revenue though. on apples second quarter earnings call ceo tim cook pointed out that services revenue growth accelerated to 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 in the first quarter. that growth slowed to 00NUMBER00 in the third quarter however as apple came up against the initial release of apple music from the prior year. the healthy clip of service revenue growth is supported by apples large and ever growing install base which topped 00NUMBER00 billion at the beginning of the year. even with declining iphone sales its a safe assumption that the install base continues to climb. but even that huge install base isnt enough to convert a lot of users into loyal paid streaming subscribers. even if every apple user had two devices from the company apple musics take rate is just 00NUMBER00. its probably much lower. spotify by comparison historically converts about 00NUMBER00 of its total listeners into paid subscribers. more recently that number has been climbing higher. spotifys subscriber rate may be growing faster than its total audience because the idea of subscribing to a service has finally gone mainstream. apple may be in part to thank for that but spotify is seeing more of the benefits. its increased conversion rate has allowed spotify to add double the number of new subscribers over the past six months as apple. the rapid growth of spotifys paid subscriber base isnt a threat to apple investors because its representative of the opportunity apple is missing in services revenue. its a threat because the real value of apples services such as apple music comes when users decide to upgrade their hardware. an apple music subscriber is much more likely to choose an apple product since its functionality is built right into the device. put simply apple music increases the value of the iphone ipad and all of apples devices for those who subscribe. thats true for all apple services including icloud apple pay imessage itunes or the app store among others. the more apple services an iphone ipad or mac user uses the higher the switching costs. despite apples efforts to outmaneuver the competition with apple musics executive team of music insiders jimmy iovine dr. dre and trent reznor its been unable to overcome spotify. apple is even throwing its considerable pile of cash around signing deals for exclusives and producing original videos for artists. spotify refuses to engage in those tactics. clearly thats not the determining factor for many subscribers. that said apple music hasnt been a failure by any means. being able to claim 00NUMBER00 million subscribers in a little over one year is nothing to sneeze at. it took spotify more than six years to reach that point. those 00NUMBER00 million are some of apples most valuable users producing service revenue and probably buying new apple hardware year after year. apple musics slower growth over the past six months compared with spotify suggests that apples services strategy will need more than the streaming service to have the desired impact of increasing the value of apples hardware. a secret billion

00NUMBER00 plus that the devices would bring incremental improvements with no major new features compelling apples installed base to upgrade and thats exactly what apple delivered. but investors grabbed hold of a few pieces of data suggesting that the iphone 00NUMBER00 is selling well. . . and ran with them. as of market close on sept. 00NUMBER00 shares of apple were up 00NUMBER00 from the day before the official launch event. sprintand t mobileseparately reported that iphone 00NUMBER00 pre orders were well ahead of previous years. t mobile stated in a press release that pre orders from friday through monday following the iphone 00NUMBER00 reveal were up by nearly a factor of four compared to the next most popular iphone. sprint pegged the increase in pre orders in the first three days compared to last year at 00NUMBER00. along with this news reports of long waits for online orders from apple of certain models fueled the idea that the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus were in high demand. as of this writing a jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus wont ship from apple until sometime in november. ordinarily apple is thrilled to announce the number of iphones it sellsduring launch weekend. last year the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus moved 00NUMBER00 million units up from 00NUMBER00 million the year before. but this year is different. following the iphone 00NUMBER00 release apple announced that it would halt the practice of disclosing launch weekend sales numbers. a company doesnt stop reporting figures that make it look good. the lack of data from apple suggests one thing the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch probably wasnt much better than the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch. if it was apple would be the first to let you know. there are other reasons to be skeptical. long wait times for online orders reveal that demand is outstripping supply. however without knowing how the initial supply changed from last year no conclusions can be drawn. the strong pre order numbers from t mobile and sprint are also not quite what they seem. all the major carriers are offering extremely aggressive promotions in order to move the iphone 00NUMBER00. by trading in an iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 customers can get an iphone 00NUMBER00 for free as long as they agree to stick with the carrier for two years. last year launch deals for the iphone 00NUMBER00 were nowhere near as generous making the comparisons less meaningful. the real question that investors should be asking is this how many phones is apple going to sell through the entire cycle the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus broke launch weekend records but they still produced the first year over year decline in quarterly iphone sales later on. these pre order numbers and launch weekend sales reflect demand among early adopters those who upgrade to the latest and greatest at the first chance not overall demand. the iphone 00NUMBER00 is a high quality device and apple is going to sell a lot of them. but the initial information that investors have received about pre orders and long wait times isnt enough to draw any real conclusions. these aggressive promotions may simply be pulling sales forward instead of creating new demand. i interpret the fact that the carriers are getting more generous over time with launch promotions as a negative for apple. it takes more prodding to get customers to upgrade now than it did in the past. perhaps the iphone 00NUMBER00 will return apple to growth. perhaps it wont. right now we dont have enough information to do anything but guess. a

apple inc symbol aapl. so this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the november 00NUMBER00 expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the november 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to happen meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the

doesnt have as strong of itunes backup passwords in ios 00NUMBER00 reports macrumors. according to the report the tech company switched how it encrypted the passwords with its new mobile operating system. this has allowed security experts to expose vulnerabilities to accounts via brute force attempts. the security experts at elcomsoft said this allows them to crack the passwords 00NUMBER00 times faster. aapl is aware of the problem and is working on a fix. sonos comes to apple store sonos wireless speakers are now available through aapls online store 00NUMBER00. the sonos speakers start at 00NUMBER00 and go up to 00NUMBER00. the speakers are compatible with apple music and gives owners more control over audio in their home. multiple speakers can be set up and configured in a single home. customers that stop by the companys physical retail stores will start seeing the speakers for sale sometime next month. iphone 00NUMBER00 headphone jack a new video claims the headphone jack is still a component in the iphone 00NUMBER00 reports bgr. the video is an obvious parody that pokes fun at apple for removing the headphone jack from the iphone 00NUMBER00. it has a person drilling a hole in the bottom of the device to uncover the hidden headphone jack. however this is a complete joke and is not to be taken seriously. still this hasnt stopped people from commenting that theyll be

this dont necessarily mean a company isnt worth investing in of course but they can be a good time to reflect on whether the company is still worth holding on to. in the case of invensense i think there are two legitimate reasons that investors should get rid of the company right now first its revenues arent diversified enough. and second the smartphone market may have its best days behind it. its no secret that invensense has had a revenue diversification problem for a while now. applenasdaq aapl accounted for 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in fiscal 00NUMBER00 made up 00NUMBER00 of all invensenses revenue in fiscal first quarter 00NUMBER00. invensense makes the gyroscopes and accelerometers that go into smartphones particularly high end ones that help orient apps when the phone is being picked up or tilted. apple is a major customer. samsungused to be until recently. the south korea based conglomerate now accounts for less than 00NUMBER00 of invensenses total revenue down from 00NUMBER00 the same time a year ago. the problem for invensense isnt just that it gets too much of its revenue from apple but also that its average selling prices asps are lower than they could be because apple is such a large customer. apple is able to put pricing pressure on the company and consequently drive down asps. so not only is invensenses stock price tied to how well or poorly apples iphones are selling but the company is likely being paid less for its technology becauseit relies so much on apple. this can be remedied of course and invensense is certainly moving in that direction. in fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the company earned 00NUMBER00 of revenue from component sales in its mobile segment but that dropped to 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. component sales from invensenses internet of things and other segment are partially to thank. the iot segment now accounts for 00NUMBER00 of revenue up from just 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. and revenue from iot recently jumped 00NUMBER00 year over year. the companys ceo behrooz abdi said on the fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 earnings call about iot that. . . the large number of customers and applications with rapidly growing sensor content creates market diversification and margin improvement opportunities for us. but invensense still has a long way to go before it sheds its overdependence on apple and that should be disconcerting for investors. in the first quarter of 00NUMBER00 idc research noted that smartphone shipments were flat with shipments ticking up by just 00NUMBER00 over year compared to growth of 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. that was the smallest year over year smartphone growth on record according to idc. idc said in a press release that the smartphone shipment stagnation is coming mainly from strong smartphone saturation in developed markets and year over year declines from apple and samsung. apple has posted two consecutive quarters of year over year declines with iphone sales slipping 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and a 00NUMBER00 year over year drop in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. recent research from gartnerconcurs with idcs smartphone outlook. the companys research director roberta cozza said in june that the smartphone market will no longer grow at the levels it has reached over the last seven years. earlier this month idcs latest numbers showed just 00NUMBER00 smartphone growth for all of 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00 last year. and the longterm outlook doesnt look great for developed markets u. s. canada japan and western europe. idc expects to see a compound annual growth rate of 00NUMBER00 from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 for those markets. one glimmer of hope comes from emerging markets asia middle east africa and latin america which are  expected to see a 00NUMBER00 cagr between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. invensense could of course still benefit from smartphone growth in emerging markets. but decreasing demand for new smartphones in developed markets could also mean fewer component sales and more pressure to look for new areas to sell its technology into. invensense isnt out of options. the company is looking to new opportunities like internet of things devices and the burgeoning virtual reality and augmented reality markets to bring in more component sales. but investors may have to wait around a long time to see the benefits from those endeavors if at all. and in the meantime the company is still too closely tied to apples success at a time when smartphone sales are plateauing. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

smartphones has probably noticed that its tough to get ahold of these phones in apples new jet black finish. its clear that demand for phones particularly the larger iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is quite robust. however the apparently unexpected level of demand for this finish isnt the only major driver of the huge supplydemand balance that currently exists. per respected kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo this jet black finish is also exceedingly difficult to manufacture right now. kuo says via macrumors that the manufacturing yields for the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are currently in the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 range. what this means is that for every 00NUMBER00 jet black casings that apple and its manufacturing partners attempt to produce 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 are unusable. allow me to explain why at least from a financial perspective such low yields can be extremely problematic for apple. the first and perhaps most obvious impact of low manufacturing yields is that apple simply wont be able to build as many phones as it had hoped to. this means apple cant meet demand as quickly as it would like to which frustrates potential buyers. the next impact is to gross marginsprofitability. there are costs associated with the manufacture of these iphone casings both raw material costs and depreciation so when apple is forced to not use an iphone casing that comes off the line it has to incur the manufacturing cost of that casing without seeing the associated revenue that shouldhave come from selling the device hurting profitability. it might seem like a good idea for apple to simply put in more manufacturing capacity for the jet black iphones to offset the lower manufacturing yields. there are a couple of problems with that. first of all a company cant simply snap its fingers and have manufacturing capacity put in the next day. building out additional capacity takes time. however perhaps a stronger argument against such overprovisioning to compensate for yields is that over time manufacturing yields will improve and demand for these phones will inevitably decline. this means if apple puts in too much capacity to try to compensate for early yield issues eventually the company and its manufacturing partners will find themselves with too muchiphone manufacturing capacity installed. having too much capacity from a financial perspective means apple still incurs the depreciation expense associated with the additional production equipment but that equipment isnt productive. this would ultimately hurt apples gross profit margins and thus overall profitability much to the chagrin ofapple stockholders. at the end of the day manufacturing expensive complex devices at the scale apple does is extremelydifficult. there are negative consequences to having too much capacity in place and at the same time there are real issues involved with not putting in enough capacity or putting in enough capacity but then yield issues bring down a companys effective output. potential buyers looking to get their hands on the jet black iphone will just need to wait for demand to die down andor for apple to improve its manufacturing yields on those models. this is a bummer but investors should at least rest assured that the idevice maker is doing its best to maximize long term shareholder value. a secret billion dollar stock

things the company announced the removal of the headphone port much to the chagrin of many. in this segment fromindustry focus tech motley fool analyst dylan lewis and fool contributor evan niu explain why apple got rid of the jack and why some of the criticisms against the company might not be completely fair. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on sept. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisgiven that the iphone line accounts for about 00NUMBER00 apples revenue it fluctuates quarter to quarter tech insiders and investors alike are eagerly anticipating this unveiling and see what the next generation device looks like. so why dont we hop right in what does the new line offer usersevan niu i think its pretty modest and incremental. every year its getting more and more incremental just because smartphones are so good nowadays that its hard to really make them that much better. the improvements a few years ago used to be so mind blowing that its like yeah you have to upgrade if you care about it. but im actually skipping this year for the first time in eight years which is weird for me just because i dont think its that compelling. so far the early indications look pretty strong in terms of. . . again the lines at the stores you have the carriers announcing a lot of good strong activity. theres a lot of positive sentiment right now around this device even though it seems in my opinion a little incremental. i dont think the improvements all that great. lewis i think one of the biggest and probably got the most press in terms of features or changes was the removal of the headphone jack. definitely one of the more controversial elements of the new phone. apple decided to shift consumers toward wireless connections using bluetooth and things like that. and of course theyre offering 00NUMBER00 airpods to help ease that pain. but the new phones will be shipping with a lightning port adapter that will allow people to plug in their headphones. it seemed like the removal of the headphone jack was really something that enabled them to up the processing power improve the battery life make some camera improvements. it was a form factor decision that help to them juice the guts of the phone itself. niu yeah. its just apples same thing of identifying that some technology standard is outdated. and the headphone jack is 00NUMBER00 plus years old. so of all the standards theyve killed in the past this is one of the oldest ones. arguably its kind of surprising that they havent done it already. but every time they do this they get a bunch of crap and people dont like it. but the market always survives. and yeah theres always these big ecosystems that are built around these ports of standard. but at the same time theyre the only company that does this that pushes the industry forward in this way because all the other companies are too afraid to make these controversial decisions. this is not a new thing for apple. they have done this for the past four years and every time they do it its controversial. you can see both sides. just like every other time theyve done it theres two sides. everyones like hey i want to still be able to use all my stuff. but then if you look forward into the trajectory of audio connectivity yeah bluetooth like you mentioned is getting a lot better especially with bluetooth low energy. its just kind of like analog going to digital. the lightning audio is a digital connection versus the headphone jack which is an analog connection. its just one of those things that probably needs to happen eventually and apple is making the leap now. and theres even suggestions now they actually just sent out a survey to their users asking if people use headphone jacks on their laptops. so theyre obviously thinking about killing it on the laptop eventually which isnt surprising. but for peoples computers there are people who plug in their home audio and computer speakers in there too in addition to headphones. its an even bigger ecosystem of devices that you would have to try to transition somehow versus on a smartphone. its just headphones versus speakers. its pretty big change its one of the bigger ones. lewis yeah. to quote apple it definitely takes courage to make a decision like that. i know as someone with a nice set of bose headphones that are not wireless. . . niu yeah like these. lewis yeah. im going to need to use that adapter. like i said they will ship with the phones. one of the criticisms is that unless you use a different type of adapter you wont be able to charge and listen to music at the same time. dylan lewisowns shares of apple. evan niu cfaowns shares of apple. the motley fool owns shares of and recommends apple. the

fourth quarter earnings have just been scheduled. after market close on thursday oct. 00NUMBER00 the tech giant will announce its quarterly results and host a live conference call to discuss its recent performance. as the quarter that marked the iphone 00NUMBER00 release investors are likely interested in these results. ahead of the earnings release heres an early look at what to watch. one key area to watch when apple reports earnings is revenue. apple has reported year over year declines in revenue for two quarters in a row and expects another drop in 00NUMBER00 management said when it reported 00NUMBER00 earnings. specifically it guided for revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion representing an 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 dive compared to year ago fourth quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. apples monstrous upgrade cycle for iphone 00NUMBER00 in fiscal 00NUMBER00 has made year over year revenue comparisons difficult since the product represents well over half of its revenue. in fiscal 00NUMBER00 iphone sales soared about 00NUMBER00 as consumers jumped on the opportunity to buy the first iphones with larger 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch displays. but the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus which sports the same form factor as the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have led to a comparatively lackluster upgrade cycle so far. while iphone has been a key reason for declining revenue in recent quarters and likely will be this quarter as well there is more uncertainty than usual when it comes to forecasting even a ballpark figure of where iphone unit sales could land. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. the uncertainty surrounding iphone sales for 00NUMBER00 is derived from several factors. first apple launched iphone 00NUMBER00 toward the end of the quarter leaving investors playing guesswork on how the new phone impacted sales. second apple didnt announce first weekend sales like it usually does. third the iphone 00NUMBER00 launched a week earlier than usual and in more than twice as many markets. theoretically these circumstances would suggest its possible the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus could provide a year over year boost for the last few weeks of the quarter and potentially help moderate declining total revenue. of course as usual deliveries of the new iphone have been limited by supply with delivery times for many of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models about a month out for buyers or order one today. all of these considerations shroud the new iphones impact on the quarter in mystery. apples guidance for total revenue in 00NUMBER00 suggests the company expected a year over year decline in iphone unit sales even with knowledge of its plans to release iphone 00NUMBER00 during the quarter. but could the iphone 00NUMBER00 provide surpass expectations and provide a big enough boost to help mitigate some of this predicted declinefor context going into this quarterly report apple delivered about 00NUMBER00 million iphones in the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00. whatever apple reports on oct. 00NUMBER00 investors already have one thing going in their favor the stock trades very conservatively with a price to earnings ratio of just 00NUMBER00. this means apple is essentially priced for continued headwinds when it comes to growth. better than expected fourth quarter results therefore would be icing on the cake. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

first beta of macos sierra 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 was released. it can be downloaded from the companys developer center and via the software update feature in the mac app store. the new beta is more focused on fixing bugs found in macos sierra than it is in introducing new features. three new patents apple has been granted three patents by the u. s. patent and trademark office reports appleinsider. the first patent is for an electronic device with mapping circuitry that uses the various sensors in mobile devices to create a depth map of an area around a person. the second patent is for a mechanical keyboard with touch capabilities. it describes a system where users could use keys for touch motions instead of having to use a trackpad. the final patent is for an optical connector. this would be a laser based system that would allow users to connect accessories to devices such as a keyboard to an ipad without a physical connection. it also wouldnt rely off of bluetooth and could

00NUMBER00. dylan lewissome of the other big things with this product release they introduced water resistance. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus can be submerged under 00NUMBER00 feet of water for 00NUMBER00 minutes. thats the benchmark that theyre using there. apple is not the first company to do this. samsungpretty heavily promotes their water resistant products. so just an interesting thing. i know that they deal with a lot of water damaged products and i dont believe that water damage will be covered under warranty. evan niu thats true. the funny thing about the waterproofing thing is that last years iphone was actually surprisingly waterproof. there are test videos from last year of people putting iphones into a bowl of water for literally an hour. they time lapsed it. and it still works. they would check every 00NUMBER00 minutes or so. so i think they had made a lot of progress last year but if you market it people are going to do it and if theyre disappointed youre in a hot spot. so i think that what they did is start this process last year didnt tell anyone about it because they didnt want to invite people to test it even though of course people tested it anyway and then now they felt more confident with the changes they did this year with making it even more sealed. so now theyre touting it as a big thing but its actually something i think they started last year or maybe even the year before that. lewis yeah i think thats a feature thats better to surprise consumers with than have them expect it and not quite deliver on it. so thats something you can look forward to if you were thinking about upgrading. the phones also tout a longer battery life i believe its an extra two hours for the iphone 00NUMBER00 over the iphone 00NUMBER00 and i believe its an extra one hour over the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus over the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. niu i think thats a big achievement because i think most of that is coming from this 00NUMBER00 fusion processor with its greater efficiency. i cant remember the numbers but i think the battery is a little bit bigger. but the majority of that gain is probably coming from efficiency gains on the power side of the processor because theyre finally doing this processor architecture that has the two powerful cores plus the two little cores which is similar to something arm used to do called big. little. but this implementation is not exactly that this one is much more sophisticated. but the concept is you use these low power cores when you have low power tasks and you save a ton of energy. i think its a huge testament to how far apples chip team has come. its crazy that theyve come this far and theyre now one of the most sophisticated process makers in the world. and their first proprietary chip was in 00NUMBER00. so were talking about six years. the 00NUMBER00 was the first one in 00NUMBER00. and now theyre at this insane level where theyre basically. . . the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is basically stronger than a macbook air. lewis thats incredible. niu in six years theyve done this. its really mind blowing. and they dont get much credit. its weird because they dont talk about this very much. lewis yeah i think they tend to focus on the very visible features and form factor elements of the product. to give you an idea of what the performance numbers look like from generation to generation the 00NUMBER00 chip is approximately 00NUMBER00 faster than the 00NUMBER00 which is what they used to power the 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 chip is twice as fast as the 00NUMBER00 which powered the iphone 00NUMBER00. youre definitely getting a pretty good performance boost there. that and the battery life are two of the really big elements that you might not notice right away just looking at the product but once you start really using it youll start to feel it. dylan lewisowns shares of apple. evan niu cfaowns shares of apple.

touting some new camera systems. the 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 plus both support 00NUMBER00 megapixel cameras. but i think one of the more noticeable things as well is the base level storage. this is something that ive been expecting for a while. i was kind of thinking they might do it with the 00NUMBER00. the 00NUMBER00 line runs 00NUMBER00 gb 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb of storage. thats up from the 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb and 00NUMBER00 gb on the iphone 00NUMBER00. theyve also decided to increase the storage of new 00NUMBER00 phones to be in line with that. so if youre buying a new 00NUMBER00 you can get it and the base level will be 00NUMBER00 gb. i think that makes sense. i know were moving to a lot of cloud storage but its nice to have some extra space on there particularly if youre a metro commuter and youre in a lot of areas where youll be offline. i know that i always appreciate that. evan niu its weird because i was always one of the few people that actually liked the 00NUMBER00 gb model purely from an investing standpoint because its so bad for consumers that its actually really good for investors if that makes sense. 00NUMBER00 gb is really so insufficient that you have to upgrade to the mid tier 00NUMBER00 gb at a minimum which boosts your revenue average selling price and all this. so from an investment standpoint i was actually a huge fan even though from a consumer standpoint its pretty bad and annoying because its so insufficient. but now with this 00NUMBER00 its a harder call because people will have to ask. . . before it was like theres no way you could get away with 00NUMBER00 gb because thats just a joke. but now with 00NUMBER00 gb maybe i could. you have to actually think about the decision do you spend the extra 00NUMBER00 to go to 00NUMBER00 gb or can you actually stick with 00NUMBER00 gb so i think itll be interesting to see what happens with asps going forward. but at the same time they just introduced se which starts at 00NUMBER00 and that already puts pretty big downward pressure on asps in general. lewis yeah maybe the logic there was the se is going to fill that niche and make it a little bit easier. i know when i got the 00NUMBER00 wasnt even a consideration. i want for the 00NUMBER00 gb model. niu exactly right and you knew apple made another 00NUMBER00. lewis just to bring it around to prices because we talked about asp average selling price the iphone 00NUMBER00 will start at 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 plus will start at 00NUMBER00. thats the starting point there. niu thats interesting too because theyre bumping the 00NUMBER00 plus by an extra 00NUMBER00. it used to just be 00NUMBER00 more and now its 00NUMBER00 more. i tend to think that the extra 00NUMBER00 that theyre charging is related to the camera system. that camera system is expensive. lewis and the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has a two lens camera now whereas in the past there was just one. the 00NUMBER00 maintains the one lens camera. certainly some added features there and a little bit of extra stuff under the hood so to speak. so i think that makes sense. dylan lewisowns shares of apple.

might want to begin contemplating the implications of a metric likely to get tons of attention guidance. apples reported guidance for its fiscal first quarter will arguably be the most interesting metric the company shares in its fourth quarter report. not only is 00NUMBER00 seasonally apples biggest thanks to the holidays and the fact that it marks the first full quarter of deliveries of its latest iphones but it typically previews managements general expectations for its latest iphone. this years first quarter in particular is notable because the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle follows apples first fiscal year of year over year declines in iphone unit sales iphone revenue and total revenue. some investors therefore will likely look to 00NUMBER00 to preview whether or not the iphone 00NUMBER00 which was launched with just two weeks left in 00NUMBER00 could be enough to help apple return to growth in 00NUMBER00. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. in other words apples guidance has the potential to show investors a light amid recent headwinds. in apples second and third fiscal quarters of 00NUMBER00 iphone revenue fell 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. with iphone accounting for about 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue this weighed on total revenue growth apples 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 total revenue fell by 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. even more apple guided for a year over year decline in revenue of about 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. so can apples guidance for 00NUMBER00 highlight reinvigorated growthinvestors are likely hoping apple will guide for a record first quarter but expectations for any meaningful growth are likely slim. while apple has set a new quarterly record for revenue during 00NUMBER00 every year since the first iphone was launched revenue only increased 00NUMBER00 in the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. in addition apples price to earnings ratio of just 00NUMBER00 suggests investors dont expect much growth if any from apple. with these factors in mind guidance for low single digit year over year growth this year could be all it takes to satisfy investors. for reference apples first fiscal quarter revenue in 00NUMBER00 was a record 00NUMBER00 billion. so investors will likely be looking for guidance to slightly exceed this number in order for apple to return to year over year growth during the important iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. investors should keep in mind that apples guidance for 00NUMBER00 could be more closely tied to the companys expected production ramp for the new iphone than it is a forecast for demand. typically apples newest iphone devices are severely supply constrained for several months after launch and the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus dont look like theyll be an exception. some of the iphone plus models for instance are currently showing estimated ship time frames of three to four weeks for customers who place an order today. and some of apples new jet black colored iphones are showing shipping estimates in november. but even though apples ability to ramp up production will likely be a key determining factor in the guidance management provides it still can be useful to investors by at least providing some insight into the latest iphone lineups potential. guidance for higher revenue for example would at least imply that demand for even a supply constrained iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus can drive quarterly revenue to new highs. of course investors should keep in mind that managements guidance for total revenue takes into account other products besides iphone. so total revenue guidance isnt necessarily directly correlated with managements expectations for iphone revenue. but since iphone represents well over half of apples total revenue its usually a lead indicator. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall

the iphone 00NUMBER00 is coming in 00NUMBER00 reports business insider. the employee whose identity remain anonymous told the publication that the next product in the companys smartphone line is the iphone 00NUMBER00. this would be a shakeup from its current system of releasing an s version of its smartphones between major updates. he met with a journalist outside of the tech companys office in herzliya israel for the discussion. the employee said he solders components for aapl and that the iphone 00NUMBER00 wont be anything like the iphone 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00. ios 00NUMBER00

for ios 00NUMBER00 is in line with adoption rates for ios 00NUMBER00 when it was released. british headquarters apple is planning to open a new headquarters in great britain reports appleinsider. the new headquarters will be located inside the battersea power station. the power station was built during the 00NUMBER00 and continued to be used 00NUMBER00. the location is being renovated and it will be used to 00NUMBER00 of the tech companys employees that are spread across eight offices in london. aapl expects to have the building ready for its employees 00NUMBER00. the post wednesday apple rumors aapl employee mentions iphone 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 first oninvestorplace. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. according to a report in digitimes sources from taiwan based touch panel makers say that applenasdaq aapl  has boosted its part and component orders for iphone 00NUMBER00 devices. in fact digitimes claims that order visibility for the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 is 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 better than the company had originally planned. digitimes sources further say that iphone 00NUMBER00 shipments from the idevice makers contract manufacturing partners during the second half of 00NUMBER00 should come in somewhere between 00NUMBER00 million and 00NUMBER00 million units down from the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 million iphone 00NUMBER00 devices that were reportedly shipped during the back half of 00NUMBER00. lets take a closer look at what this latest report could mean for apples business. once it became clear that demand for apples then new iphone 00NUMBER00 series of smartphones wasnt as strong as expected given the runaway success of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus series the company was forced to take significant and swift actions to bring down iphone channel inventories as its fiscal year 00NUMBER00 progressed. this year apple likely wanted to err on the side of caution until it got a clearer picture of the kind of demand the new phones would see. based on this report assuming of course that its accurate apple has likely seen significantly better than expected customer response to these new iphones. although apple has apparently boosted its iphone 00NUMBER00 plus build plans its clear that those build plans are still lower than they were a year ago. however i dont think that investors can necessarily conclude that demand itself is down year over year by just comparing those build plan figures. for one thing as a result of buildingshipping too many iphones in the back half of 00NUMBER00 apple wound up slashing march quarter build plans significantly. indeed japanese publication nikkei claimedback in january of this year that apple took down its iphone 00NUMBER00 build plans by 00NUMBER00 for the march quarter relative to prior expectation. note that this 00NUMBER00 figure didnt refer to a sequential drop normal seasonal patterns already call for a drop in iphone sales in the march quarter but to a drop relative to apples prior expectations on top of the expected seasonal shipment reduction. this time around i expect iphone sales to be down sequentially as seasonal patterns would suggest but my expectation particularly as apple still seems to be extremely supply constrainedon some models is that the drop will be more like the one that apple saw during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle than the severe one seen during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. now if apple winds up shipping fewer phones in the first and second quarters of fiscal 00NUMBER00 relative to those shipped during the first and second quarters of fiscal 00NUMBER00 then it would be reasonable to say that demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 series is down relative to demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 series a year ago. the new iphones arent revolutionary but they are extremely well built best in class premium smartphones that have a lot going for them both in absolute feature terms and compared to what even the best that the competition has to offer. indeed i believe that from a competitive perspective iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are much better positioned than last years iphone 00NUMBER00 plus were. as a result of this i remain optimistic that these latest iphones will do extremely well for the idevice maker and could even drive full year revenue and unit growth in its iphone business. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

interest since its unveiling event earlier this month. in this segment fromindustry focus tech motley fool analyst dylan lewis and fool contributor evan niu talk about what has investors so excited about apple and why their interest is a bit ironic in the context of the companys recently stated goals. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on sept. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisthe company predictably took some flak for its decision to ditch the headphone jack like we talked about and questionable use of the word courage throughout the presentation. but the stock is up 00NUMBER00 the last five days. for a company apples size thats pretty noteworthy. any time you see something like that i think its less to do with the product specs and more to do with whats going on with pre order information that weve seen from a couple different outlets. some of the different wireless carriers announced what they were seeing in terms of pre order activity. t mobile said the two new iphones have shattered previous sales records. i believe orders are coming in at something like four times what the iphone 00NUMBER00 did. sprint also saw very high pre order numbers. they said orders were up 00NUMBER00 over the first three days of pre order availability compared to last year. att and verizon were a bit more muted in what they were talking about related to the iphone line and said that pre orders were pretty much business as usual business as expected. evan niu i think att said at a conference the other day that they were just above expectations. still pretty vague. lewis yeah. some really nice color from t mobile and sprint not so much att and verizon. but i cant say that im surprised were seeing some really good pre orders. no. 00NUMBER00 its an iphone and no. 00NUMBER00 the wireless carriers most of them i think all four of them have gone with the free iphone 00NUMBER00. so its tough to parse out how much of that is what would be a full price purchase iphone versus a free iphone thats coming with an upgrade and a two year commitment to that wireless provider. so thats the grain of salt that you need to take with any of those pre order numbers. niu like you said the stock has been up 00NUMBER00 or so over the past few days. and i think thats interesting because its on heavy volume. if you look at the volume activity the gain is on in the back theres a lot of volume. theres a lot of people coming in its not a light volume move. theres a lot of people that are coming into the stock on all this iphone 00NUMBER00 is kind of ironic because theres basically this idea theres a sentiment that iphone 00NUMBER00 is going to be strong the carrier stuff you mentioned. but the irony is apple has been trying really hard to shift away from focusing so much on unit sales numbers which is also partly why i think theyre not going to release their launch weekend sales for the first time in five plus years. theyve always announced launch figures every year but this year they said theyre not going to. lewis yeah i believe a company spokesperson said and im actually taking this from an article you wrote these initial sales will be governed by supply not demand and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers. niu the silly part about that is that thats been true every year. lewis yeah thats always the case. niu i dont really believe their reasoning for why theyre saying it because there has always been supply constraints. every year its supply constraint. thats not a new thing. so them saying theyre not going to give this number because of that i think thats kind of a cop out. i think its part of the broader strategy to get people to stop focusing on unit sales because what they want people to focus on particularly investors is to look at these recurring revenue sources. theyve been touting all this installed base purchases and services revenue and all these things that are not tied to unit sales. theyre trying to get investors to focus on those numbers instead of unit sales. but obviously investors are still focused on unit sales because when you hear all these positive storylines about the iphone 00NUMBER00 they go out and buy the stock. also combine this with the fact that the samsung note 00NUMBER00 are exploding that also helps. so i think theres a lot of positivity around the iphone 00NUMBER00 the fact that apple is trying to shift the focus away from how many units they sell. lewis yeah. i think youre absolutely right. you look at the way their revenue mix is going its going to play out that way. like i said earlier the iphone contribution to revenue was in the past about two thirds. i believe it was down to about 00NUMBER00 of their most recent quarter and thats because of that rising service revenue. you also have the introduction of the watch line and things like that which they updated in this most recent press event. but yeah the iphone while its going to be the cash cow for them i think theyre making efforts to highlight other parts of the business. dylan lewisowns shares of apple and verizon communications. evan

supply constrained. does this mean iphone deliveries next quarter could disappoint not necessarily. the first deliveries of apples newest iphone lineup the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus were handed over on sept. 00NUMBER00. with deliveries starting about a week earlier than usual some investors may have reasoned that this early production schedule could give apple a good shot at minimizing supply constraints as the company went into its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which starts on oct. 00NUMBER00. but iphone 00NUMBER00 supply remains severely constrained just a couple of days before the start of 00NUMBER00. it only takes a few minutes of viewing different iphone 00NUMBER00 models on apples website to realize just how backed up the company is. a fully stocked iphone delivers the following day after an order. but shipping estimates for varying iphone 00NUMBER00 models range from two weeks to over a month. an attiphone 00NUMBER00 with 00NUMBER00 of storage for instance ships in two to three weeks. and on the other end of the spectrum a jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus with 00NUMBER00 of storage ships in november. its not clear whether higher than expected demand severe supply challenges or a combination of both are the reason for the iphone 00NUMBER00 constrained availability. reports from sprintand t mobilestating that iphone 00NUMBER00 preorders were five times higher than the 00NUMBER00 launch and four times higher than the iphone 00NUMBER00 launch respectively suggest that higher than expected demand could be the culprit. but since this is a very limited view into the demand for iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus this shouldnt be trusted as a lead indicator for estimating iphone 00NUMBER00 demand. further its simply impossible to know how well apple is actually ramping up supply. chances are iphone 00NUMBER00 supply constraints can be credited to both higher than expected demand and supply challenges. fortunately for apple investors the company has dealt with problems like this before. this is far from the first time the tech giant has come up short of iphone demand in the months after launch. apples iphone 00NUMBER00 supply constraints two years ago for example persisted through the entire first fiscal quarter and even lasted into the companys fiscal second quarter. and just about every iphone launch has faced supply constraints for certain models for several months. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. despite many instances of supply constraints in the months following a new iphone launch iphone revenue has set a new record every holiday quarter. put simply apple knows a thing or two about addressing supply constraints. theres one particular reason for investors to have confidence in apples ability to ramp up production of iphone 00NUMBER00 this year the companys initial launch for the iphone spanned far more countries than usual. on sept. 00NUMBER00 apple launched iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in 00NUMBER00 markets. then the company followed up with a launch in 00NUMBER00 more markets by sept. 00NUMBER00. comparatively iphone 00NUMBER00 was first launched in just 00NUMBER00 markets and it wasnt even until 00NUMBER00 days into october than apple started bringing the iphone to additional markets. therefore apples comparatively more aggressive global rollout for its iphone 00NUMBER00 this year suggests management is apparently somewhat confident in its ability to ramp up iphone production. investors of course should keep in mind that participating in guesswork related to iphone sales based on shipping estimates or even supply rumors is tricky business. but severely limited iphone 00NUMBER00 availability at least suggests the company doesnt have a demand problem on its hands. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

service came out on top. apple often notes that customer satisfaction is possibly the most important metric that it cares about since high satisfaction levels translate into higher usage as well as ongoing upgrades for recurring revenue. the study looked at several different categories of listeners including highly engaged listeners and passive listeners but overall satisfaction was affected by several other factors as well. its critical for a service to work on a wide range of devices and social features are also quite important for listeners to share music with friends and family. exclusive content also helps win people over. overall paid services were able to garner higher satisfaction ratings than free services. the biggest areas of improvement related to customer service and communication. this makes sense because free ad based services are less likely to invest in service and support infrastructure in order to provide top notch service to non paying customers. ad based models just dont generate enough money. image source j. d. power. j. d. power also said that apple music users felt most committed to the service due largely to the deep integration across all of their devices. interestingly j. d. power notes that using peripheral devices to enhance listening translates into significant improvements in satisfaction. the most meaningful of these devices are smartwatches so apple watchs music functions helped earn apple some more points there. being able to access the service on a bluetooth speaker also helps although apple music is not integrated directly with any bluetooth speakers yet. pandoraand spotify scored comparably just a point apart while amazoncomprime music and google play music fared poorly. the e commerce and search giants have never really tried thathard to make an impact on the music streaming market and their respective offerings are mostly me too services. the results of this poll were based on surveying nearly 00NUMBER00 customers during june and july of this year. apple music has just received a completely redesigned interface thats meant to improve usability and make the interface more intuitive a justified complaint of the original version. the new interface was unveiled at the companys wwdc developer conference in june but was not broadly available until earlier this month when ios 00NUMBER00 rolled out. since apple only offers a paid tier a strategic decision that is helping to resurrect the music industry which j. d. power notes enjoys higher satisfaction levels apple will on average have better satisfaction than rivals that offer free tiers. apple music has been out for just over a year and the company will continue bolstering the service as one of its most important services. at 00NUMBER00 million paid subscribers paying 00NUMBER00 per month this is now a 00NUMBER00 billion per year business. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

here. this podcast was recorded on sept. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisthis recent rise that we talked about actually pushes apple above a 00NUMBER00 pe on a trailing basis for the first time in a year. evan niu ooh so expensive laughs lewis yeah right its kind of insane. but looking at how all of this fits into where the business is going last quarter the company guided for revenue between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. and even if they dramatically beat that guidance which theyve typically been in the high end of their guidance range or slightly above it they will likely fall short of previous years number for the third straight quarter. i believe last year ago quarter the fourth fiscal quarter they were around 00NUMBER00 billion just to give you an idea of how different the guidance is there. its tough to keep seeing this. the product is really successful. customer satisfaction was really great. they just keep going up against these really tough comps. eventually thats going to change but dont expect that trajectory to be any different for the next couple quarters. i think thats one of the key things investors need to keep in mind here. youre going to probably see year over year declines for this quarter next quarter possibly even three quarters out. niu i think theres a chance the iphone 00NUMBER00 generally speaking regardless of the time. . . the timing for the year over year comps is always tricky because its always really dependent on when they launched the phone. in this case theyre launching the phone with two or three weeks left to the quarter. last year i think they had just a couple days. so the launch timing really has a big impact on how much of that launch gets captured in which quarter. but in general i think theres a chance that the 00NUMBER00 could push the cycle up. the sense is iphone unit sales have picked because theyve been flat ish roughly over the past year year over year or whatever. but if you look every two years they basically pushed higher because of the cycle this two year design cycle of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 etc. so the performance of the sales at least for the past two major product cycles they tend to go in tandem. because if most people upgrade their phones every two years and all the people who upgraded for the 00NUMBER00 are probably all going to upgrade for the 00NUMBER00 they had this pattern of going in pairs. who knows if that actually plays out again this year because the sales are so high that is hard to really grow. but i think theres a possibility particularly with all the kinds of indications that were seeing. but i wouldnt bet on it. im just saying its like a curveball its possible. lewis weve talked in the past about the idea of two year comps being a bit more relevant for apple because of the update cycle that theyre on. i think as you talked about before their refreshes on the product become more incremental and less major step changes then i start to look at them more on a year over year basis. to your point about releases another important thing to remember here is all the numbers that apple will be reporting for fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 only two weeks of that period will have the iphone 00NUMBER00 available. it will be a part of those numbers but it will not be a major contributor. youre going to really want to look at fiscal 00NUMBER00 calendar 00NUMBER00 for what its going to be doing for the financial statements. im sure were going to get some commentary in the company call come fiscal 00NUMBER00. but thats something to keep in mind. niu and its weird because this is the first time theyve ever pushed a three year design cycle. itll be really interesting to see how that changes the performance. theyve never done a three year design cycle before. and its also a testament to smartphones getting more mature. its kind of like laptops. they redesign laptops every four to five years but they would redesign their phones every two years. so now youre seeing they feel comfortable that they can push that limit on the design side. but then the real question is what happens next year because everyone is expecting a new design next year maybe another display maybe no home button maybe curb display whatever. then it just throws everything out of whack the fact that theyre changing the timing of these cycles. its going to be cool to see what happens going forward. and plus what are they going to call it they cant call it the 00NUMBER00 if they change the design altogether. lewis eventually theyre going to have to ditch that naming convention one way or another. niu ive been saying they should ditch that thing for years. this is the iphone 00NUMBER00. its the 00NUMBER00 iphone. and what next year itll be the iphone 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00 iphone it just makes no sense. lewis yeah. i think to bring it back around and what to watch for here if the product incremental upgrades that we talked about some of their performance changes are visible enough to people that maybe currently hold an iphone 00NUMBER00 or the offers from these wireless carriers look compelling enough i think you could see some really great numbers for fiscal 00NUMBER00 which will be calendar 00NUMBER00. but you wont get a report on that for quite a bit. be wary of that and know that any really big enthusiasm is going to come through more on the companys call than in the numbers that the company reports next quarter. anything else on this thats kind of investing take away. obviously everything that they delivered here was what wed been expecting from pre launch leaks and rumors. niu yeah. everything pretty much came in right on target with expectations as far as the product specs and things like that. i think the watch 00NUMBER00 looks ok its kind of the same thing watch 00NUMBER00 like what they should have done with the first one. i dont think many people are going to upgrade from the watch 00NUMBER00 to the watch 00NUMBER00. it just doesnt seem very compelling. but maybe they get more first time adopters that were on the fence about watch 00NUMBER00 and didnt do it but now watch 00NUMBER00 is more compelling a stronger product so maybe the people that were on the fence will jump in and go ahead and be a first time buyer for the smartwatch. and of course once they do that theyre on this upgrade track and theyre going to eventually upgrade however long who knows. lewis yeah you have the chance to win over those people who dont want to own a first generation device with the watch basically. niu right. i think the watch 00NUMBER00 does look compelling in that sense. of course theres no detailed results to compare to because apple wont give them to us. but just generally i think products just get better over time. next month theyre supposed to have these new macbook pros which might reinvigorate the mac lineup. that lineup has been there for four years. so coming out with a new thing there could really juice the mac performance for the next few years. dylan lewisowns shares of apple. evan niu cfaowns shares of apple. the motley fool owns shares of

term. in particular pricelines image doesnt resonate with the younger crowd the way airbnb does. and airbnb is growing like clockwork. its latest funding round values the company at some 00NUMBER00 billion. priceline is twice as big but it has been around for much longer. yet if airbnb is a threat to the traditional hotel industry and therefore traditional hotel booking sites then that threat has yet to materialize. a report from earlier in the year shows that in a survey of 00NUMBER00 travelers 00NUMBER00 continued to use hotelsand 00NUMBER00 said they would use an airbnb competitor. blackberry just shot itself in the footthe biggest threat however comes from the industry itself. as priceline founder jay walker recently stated the booking industry is a dinosaurthis is really the end of the age of automation online travel booking sites are a model t ford with a ferrari engine. theres no question that the phone and mobile changes everything then you add augmented reality artificial intelligence and big data… this version of online travel is going to seem like a dial phone. whats different now is that the compounding growth rate has caught up. priceline will need to innovate if it hopes to continue leading the booking industry and live up to its long term growth rates. and it knows that. but if it can effectively do so and before other competitors can those already impressive growth rates could actually be on the conservative side. as of this writing john kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. the 00NUMBER00 best blue

survey by bank of americas investment arm bank of america merrill lynch via business insider. the same survey also suggested the companys second generation apple watch could lead to more growth in the nascent segment. will these two products be what apple needs to help revenue turn upward againthough apples sept. 00NUMBER00 event was focused primarily on its newest iphones the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus it may be airpods and apple watch series 00NUMBER00 that investors should be thankful for. bamls poll of 00NUMBER00 u. s. consumers regarding purchase intentions for the two devices suggests they could generate accretive revenue. airpods. image source apple. airpodsin line with apples removal of the headphone jack from its newest iphone the company announced its first ever apple branded wireless headphones at its september event. the headphones premium price tag of 00NUMBER00 is high enough to provide a small boost to apples bottom line if even just a fraction of customers buy them. but would a fraction of apples customers even be interestedas it turns out a surprising 00NUMBER00 of survey respondents indicated they intend to purchase airpods. applying this purchase intent rate to apples u. s. installed base this new product could generate 00NUMBER00 billion in incremental revenue for the company baml pointed out. while 00NUMBER00 billion would only represent about a 00NUMBER00 increase to apples annual revenue small increases like this are notable in light of the stocks conservative valuation. apple watch series 00NUMBER00 the fact that the second generation of apples new smartwatch only received internal upgrades and the exterior remained the same theres still meaningful interest in the updated version. eight percent of respondents said they planned to buy the watch series 00NUMBER00. apple watch series 00NUMBER00. image source apple. meaningful interest in the apple watch series 00NUMBER00 is particularly notable because of the uncertainty surrounding this new product segment for apple. its not clear yet if wearable technology can turn into a meaningful business for the company. if bamls estimates of purchase intent by u. s. consumers for the apple watch series 00NUMBER00 is somewhat close to reality the updated version of the device could be enough to help the segment continue growing meaningfully during fiscal 00NUMBER00. while these segments could help provide the icing on the cake for apple investors the company will need the iphone to hold its own for this potential upside revenue from its airpods and apple watch to actually feel like a bonus. the iphone accounted for a staggering 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in its most recently reported quarter. if the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus cant prevent a further decline in iphone sales accretive revenue from smaller newer product segments simply wont be enough to return the tech company to growth. fortunately apples paltry price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 means all apple needs from its iphone segment is for it to maintain current levels. other new products and services can do the rest of the work needed for the stocks price today to make sense. of course this is easier said than done. whether apples critical iphone segment returns to growth in the near future or not its good to see budding areas with potential to supplement the companys revenue and bottom line. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

source apple. for the past couple of years apple inc. snasdaq aapl ipad product cycles have been a bit unpredictable. the company shifted away from annual releases a couple years ago presumably because apple realized that tablet upgrade cycles are longer and frequent redesigns and refreshes werent as necessary. for instance apple only launched the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro at its september 00NUMBER00 event alongside a refreshed ipad mini 00NUMBER00 with internal spec bumps. well we could be in store for as many as three new ipads launching within a matter of months. japanese blog mac otakarais reporting that apple is preparing to introduce a handful of ipad pros next spring including a 00NUMBER00 inch version a 00NUMBER00 inch version and a 00NUMBER00 inch version. the 00NUMBER00 inch model is said to get a beefier 00NUMBER00 megapixel primary camera alongside a true tone display and wider color gamut like the one found in the newer 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro that launched earlier this year. the same is expected for a 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro which would bring the mini up to pro specs as well as add the four speaker stereo sound system. perhaps more interesting is the news of a possible 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro which would represent a modest increase from the 00NUMBER00 inch display that apple has always offered for the ipad starting with the original. if true this device would see a small increase in size in order to accommodate a larger display. all three tablets are expected to keep the 00NUMBER00 mm headphone jack for now unlike the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. the news follows a similar report in august from kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo that predicted the mid sized model would increase to a 00NUMBER00 inch display. the big push into enterprise tablet sales by targeting professional users seems to be paying off so it makes plenty of sense why apple may be doubling down on its pro efforts for the ipad. investors have been watching the ipad business decline for several years as the upgrade priority is lower which is why the upgrade cycles are longer than apple initially expected. the good news is that the year over year declines are slowly improving and last quarters negative 00NUMBER00 growth was the best performance in two years. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. chart by author. its harder to know where the saturation limit is for the tablet market since many people will decide that they dont need or want one. roughly half of u. s. adults own a tablet according to the pew research center. in contrast smartphone penetration in the u. s. is now around 00NUMBER00 according to comscore. but the enterprise market still has a long way to go which is precisely why apple just partnered up with deloitte to help sell more ios devices there. who knows maybe well even see ipad units grow again in the near future. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

apple. enough is enough. i know i know i bring this up every year. but thats because apple inc. snasdaq aapl ongoing practice of numbered iphones gets more and more ridiculous every year. it used to kind of make a little bit of sense sort of. it started with the iphone 00NUMBER00 which was actually the fourth generation iphone that apple made. but over time and several iterations of apples borrowed tick tock s cycles it got out of hand. quickly. apple developed a habit of changing the numbering every other year when it introduced iphones with new industrial designs. in between those years it appended s on for iterative spec bumps s initially stood for speed back in 00NUMBER00. data source apple. chart by author. that would have normally presented a dilemma for 00NUMBER00 since for the first time this years model used the same overall design for the third year running. but since iphone 00NUMBER00 is just plain absurd apple went ahead and added a number. but what does apple do next year when it is expected introduce a redesigned iphone that is potentially made of glass and features a wraparound oled displaythe apple media has already started casually referring to the 00NUMBER00 iphone as the iphone 00NUMBER00 but patently applehas spotted some fresh evidence that apple may indeed go this route. apple has filed for a couple of figurative 00NUMBER00 trademarks in different countries stylizing an 00NUMBER00 using the recognizable activity rings from apple watch. apple does use this icon to represent activity sharing which is a big part of the social push for apple watch but there is also some speculation that apple will use this icon to stylize iphone 00NUMBER00 next year. there should be no question that apple must get away from the numbers eventually. i really hope were not still having this conversation in five years if apple releases the iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 the 00NUMBER00 generation iphone. if we accept that inevitability then apple should transition to a more sustainable branding system sooner rather than later. the iphone se has no number associated with it which is progress. apple is seemingly doing away with numbers in the ipad family as well with the recent ipad pros being denoted partially in the same way as macs display size. apple needs to just shift to the same system that it uses in the mac identifying models by display size and year. please stop apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss

with pancreatic cancer. most observers wouldnt consider five years a particularly long period of time but the tech world tends to move remarkably fast five years is an eternity in silicon valley. that may be why it feels like tim cook has been applesnasdaq aapl  ceo for so long taking over just a few months prior to jobs death. here are five notable ways that apple has changed under cooks leadership. jobs had famously created internal silos within apple in his never ending pursuit of secrecy. there are no shortages of stories about the security measures that apple used to employ particularly around top secret projects. while there should be no doubt that some of these structures are still in place its just as clear that cook has broken down a lot of those walls with the goal of increasing collaboration. the high profile ouster of former ios chief scott forstall in 00NUMBER00 was done in the name of collaboration. forstall didnt get along with many other executives including jony ive. plus he refused to take ownership of the disastrous apple maps launch. recognizing that in order to achieve the maximum level of integration across hardware software and services it doesnt make much sense to compartmentalize engineers cook set about to improve apples ability to collaborate. its probably not a coincidence that apples various online services while not without fault now perform better than ever before. as more of a traditional mba type of ceo cook places higher value on shareholders and their opinions. jobs never had much regard for investors and merely tolerated them by necessity. jobs was also always averse to returning capital to shareholders preferring to hoard cash to an unreasonable degree. he even ignored warren buffetts adviceon the matter. apples massive capital return program is easily the most shareholder friendly move that cook has made. the company simply had way too much capital just idling on the balance sheet. through june 00NUMBER00 apple had returned a cumulative total of 00NUMBER00 billion since 00NUMBER00 between dividends and share repurchases. thats 00NUMBER00 billion more than what apple returned to shareholders under jobs. to be fair jobs delivered capital appreciation in spades. for the longest time under jobs apple would mostly stonewall the media. anytime you read any article about apple you could count on the obligatory line that apple declined to comment. this was a strategic aspect of how jobs would influence the media by using controlled favoritism. any media outlet getting access to apple was a big deal. after becoming ceo cook wanted to actively change the way that apple interacts with the media. the companys longtime head of pr katie cotton retired in 00NUMBER00 after 00NUMBER00 years at apple. officially cottons retirement was attributed to personal reasons but unofficially there was a clear shift in how cook wanted apple to be perceived. mark gurmans expose at 00NUMBER00 to joining bloomberg back in 00NUMBER00 on apples media and pr strategy is a must read. these days apple responds to media inquiries and grants executive interviews far more than ever before. it may also come as a shock to remember how much more modest apples financial performance was in 00NUMBER00 relatively speaking. in the four full fiscal quarters preceding jobs death apple had sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones generated 00NUMBER00 billion in total sales and posted 00NUMBER00 billion in net income. the company had 00NUMBER00 billion in total cash on the balance sheet a few days before his death. apple has now reached a quarterlyrecord of 00NUMBER00 million iphones trailing 00NUMBER00 month sales stand at over 00NUMBER00 billion and net income over the past year has been almost 00NUMBER00 billion. the numbers speak for themselves cook has executed tremendously well. cook has also helped usher in a new era of social responsibility for apple. from addressing human rights issues within

have probably all seen the tv commercials that show an investor spotting an emerging trend in the world around them and cleverly investing early in such a way as to benefit from it but in reality the world is a lot bigger than what we encounter every day. at times though we all see or hear things that make us stop and think. this is exactly what happened to me the other dat when my fourteen year old son launched into his “what i want for christmas” talk. “if i only get one thing this year” he said “i’ll be happy if it is a series 00NUMBER00 apple watch. ”that may not sound remarkable particularly if you dont know my son but he is very fashion conscious and until that moment had been disdainful of the watch regarding it as something that only middle aged people wore ostentatiously and in an attempt to appear cool. on further questioning it became clear that he was not alone in his change of heart his friends too had shifted from viewing the device as geeky and old before its time to a must have holiday item. as i said this could just be a local phenomenon and of no real importance when it comes to apple stock aapl but the thought occurred to me that maybe just maybe it was a sign that apple is getting back to what built their phenomenal success knowing what we want before we do. the first iteration of the watch was not a huge success but it appears that they have learned from that and have now come up with something that even teens see as an essential accessory. if that is the case then with the holiday season approaching it is a brave investor who would bet against aapl. there are of course plenty of other more conventional reasons why buying aapl makes sense right now. from a technical perspective as the chart above shows the stock is sitting right in the middle of a well defined steeple sloping upward channel that bodes well for the next month or so at least. also if we expand out to a three year chart we see that october has traditionally been a good month for aapl. that is not really surprising as investors’ focus traditionally shifts to the holiday season in october and apple products always seem like logical gift items. the reality doesn’t always meet expectations but that is not the point. just the anticipation of a great holiday season is enough to give the stock a boost at this time of year. and above all apart from the seasonal and technical reasons to buy the stock there is the most basic one of all…value. value is hard to find in the market at the moment and as we enter the fourth quarter fund managers and other professionals will be hunting it down wherever it can be found. in those circumstances a trailing pe of around 00NUMBER00 for the most successful company of all time looks mighty appealing. all in all as we approach a holiday season that if the latest consumer spending numbers are to be believed threatens to be a disappointment holding aapl will likely be safe. and it could even if my son’s change of heart is any indication be a lot more exciting than that. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.

inc.  apple ceo tim cook at an apple product launch event. image source apple. applenasdaq aapl had previously scheduled to report its fourth quarter earnings on thursday oct. 00NUMBER00. but a scheduling conflict recently prompted apple to move its earnings to oct. 00NUMBER00. the rare rescheduling of apples earnings release has prompted speculation that the tech giant is planning a product launch event in its place. numerous reports have pointed to an apple event in october. of course an october apple event wouldnt be out of the norm. the company has launched new products during october in four out of the last five years. the bigger question of course would be why apple would want to move its earnings release earlier so the company can launch products on oct. 00NUMBER00. the most plausible explanation for apple moving its earnings release for an apple event is that it doesnt want declining iphone sales overshadowing product launch news. its no secret apple is likely to report a year over year decline in total revenue driven by declining iphone sales for its fourth fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. apple has guided for revenue to decline anywhere between 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 year over year. even if apple beats its own guidance for the quarter revenue is still likely to be down on a year over year basis making headlines reporting declining sales nearly inevitable. by scheduling an apple event after earnings instead of before the company can replace earnings headlines with ones focused on its latest products. the ever active apple rumor mill expects the companys october event to be focused on mac products. macbook. image source apple. one product likely to debut at the fall event is a significantly overhauled macbook pro. expectations for a new macbook pro started gaining steam when the very reliable and well connect apple analyst ming chi kuo from kgi securities said via 00NUMBER00 apple plans to introduce a thinner and lighter version of the device this year. the new macbook pro will take design cues from the recently overhauled macbook include touch id support and a new oled display touch bar kuo said. other products the apple rumor mill has speculated could debut at an october event are new macbook airs and imacs and maybe even a 00NUMBER00 display. an october event with new mac products would be a boon for the company at a very important time. not only are many of apples mac products overdue for a refresh but the segment has been hurting recently. lacking new products to help sales apples mac segment revenue was down 00NUMBER00 in the companys most recent quarter. with mac sales accounting for about 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue declining revenue in this segment can drag apples overall business. further by refreshing its mac products ahead of the holidays apple would help set itself up for a big holiday quarter. combining new macs with a recent launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and apple watch series 00NUMBER00 apple would have a shot at returning to year over year revenue growth in 00NUMBER00. investors of course shouldnt fret over the exact date of an apple launch event. whether the event is scheduled before or after earnings wont make a difference in the companys business over the long haul. but the date change for a scheduling conflict does make a strong case for an apple product launch event in october. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a

was. in fact it has suffered significant year over year declines for many quarters. yet ipads still represented approximately 00NUMBER00 of the idevice makers revenue in the companys last fiscal year. it is also a segment that apples still quite serious about investing in. according to mac otakara a generally reliable source of apple news and leaks the idevice maker is planning to refresh its ipad lineup this coming spring with three new models. today apple offers its ipads in three display sizes 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 inches. mac otakara says the upcoming ipad refresh will replace the 00NUMBER00 inch tablet with one thats 00NUMBER00 inches and that the new models will include displays that support the wider dci 00NUMBER00 color gamut that the current 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro and iphone 00NUMBER00 series already do. the new ipads are also expected to support apples true tone display technology allowing the devices to adjust the color temperatures of their displays in real time. true tone is currently available only on the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro. bloombergs mark gurman reported back in august that apples next ipad would use a faster display technology in other words high refresh rate displays. these should significantly improve the user experience in day to day usage and should also enhance the experience in gaming applications assuming that the graphics performance is there which is why i predict the next chip iteration 00NUMBER00 deliver a substantial improvement in graphics performance relative to the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. currently only the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro features a 00NUMBER00 megapixel rear camera sensor. the smaller ipad mini 00NUMBER00 and the 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro are still saddled with older generation 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensors. the report says that the new ipads will all get 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensors. all of these new ipads will apparently have wide color displays and given that the 00NUMBER00 megapixel sensors inside the iphone 00NUMBER00 series smartphones are able to capture wide color photos i expect apple to carry over the same rear camera sensors from the iphone 00NUMBER00 to these new ipads. mac otakara doesnt say anything about the front facing or selfie cameras on these devices but given that only the new 00NUMBER00 megapixel front facing shooters on the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus support wide color capture i expect apple to carry that sensor over to the new ipads as well. the report also says that all of the new ipad pros will include a quad microphone setup an upgrade from the dual microphone setup currently used in the ipad lineup. this doesnt seem like a game changer but apple does advertise the dual microphone setup in the current ipads as being helpful for calls video recording and audio recording. presumably the move to a quad microphone setup will lead to noticeable improved audio quality in these applications ultimately improving the user experience of the device. apples ipad hardware has been and continues to be superb. i struggle to think of a competing tablet product that even comes close to what apples doing. that being said given that the upgrade cycles in tablets are quite lengthy especially compared with those seen in smartphones and given that large screen smartphones have cannibalized tablets to a fairly significant degree its not clear if all of these innovations will be enough to have a real impact on sales of ipads. nevertheless if demand for tablets industrywide should show signs of improvements i continue to believe that the idevice maker will be well positioned with best in class products to capitalize on that demand. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

anything the technology world has seen growing from a nascent product to one that sells 00NUMBER00 million annually. however as the smartphone industry slows apple aapl needs to come up with something to augment the iphone and keep revenue on an upward trajectory. some have suggested the car will be apples next big product while others have guessed virtual reality or even its growing services business which now generates 00NUMBER00 billion in annual revenue. but there is one productcategory that may be bigger than all of them combined and its hiding in plain sight augmented reality. ceo tim cook spoke with utah senator orrin hatch this past weekend about a multitude of topics including privacy and steve jobs legacy but it was cooks comments about ar that were perhaps most telling. ar is going to take a while because there are some really hard technology challenges there cook said during the conversation. but it will happen it will happen in a big way and we will wonder when it does how we ever lived without it. like we wonder how we lived without our phone today. that last line specifically the part of how we lived without our phone is very telling. apple does not always need to be first into areas it wasnt the first 00NUMBER00 player the first smartphone the first tablet but it does want to create definining experiences in product categories it thinks are transformative and beneficial to its consumers. its clear cook sees ar as just that especially since hes referenced it so many times on earnings calls or in interviews with media. the stats support cooks comments. tech ma advisory firm digi capital expects the augmentedvirtual reality market to reach 00NUMBER00 billion by 00NUMBER00 with ar dominating the market. whether its building an app that lets you have new experiences like those of pokemon go putting information on top of piece of wood to show you where to cut or putting a piece of virtual furniture inside your living room to see how it looks ar will wind up radically changing how we live just as the iphone once did. its unclear yet how apple which is already investing in ar will enter the market. but if the companys past history is any guide it will likely be from a hardware and software perspective. this means we can expect features for ar hiding in plain sight when new iphones or ipads are announced similar to the 00NUMBER00 d camera capabilities seen in the ipone 00NUMBER00 plus which andreessen horowitz analyst ben evans postulated may be a sign apple is dipping its toes in the virtual reality water. as cook and others at apple continue to talk about the possibilities of augmented reality its clear apples next big thing will include ar. i for one cant wait to see how they go about doing it. the views and

2016-10-10 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.1977028635173463,0.2143624190972781,0.0004166306938183,wall street analysts are sharply divided in their expectations for applesnasdaq aapl recently released iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. some are predicting a return to solid iphone sales growth in the current quarter 00NUMBER00 of apples fiscal 00NUMBER00. others expect iphone sales to continue declining for now. indeed there are reasons for optimism as well as reasons for caution regarding apples 00NUMBER00 iphone sales. however on balance the evidence suggests that apple will report a solid increase in iphone sales for the quarter ending in december. a month ago most analysts had very modest expectations for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and its larger sibling the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. after all iphone sales have been declining for nearly a year and the new iphones dont offer any revolutionary upgrades. early demand for the new iphones has been solid. image source apple. however since then a variety of good news has trickled out. all four big u. s. wireless carriers reported record iphone pre orders. additionally various supply chain sources have indicated that apple is raising its iphone component orders. finally the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in particular has a long order backlog. as a result analysts are slowly but surely raising their iphone unit shipment estimates for 00NUMBER00. most of the analysts who have revised their forecasts in recent weeks now expect apple to sell more iphones in the current quarter than the 00NUMBER00 million it moved in last years first quarter. still some remain skeptical of apples near term prospects. for example barclaysanalyst mark moskowitz recently cut his 00NUMBER00 iphone shipment estimate to 00NUMBER00 million units. that would represent a nearly 00NUMBER00 year over year decline. moskowitz thinks that after the initial burst of sales to early adopters iphone 00NUMBER00 demand could quickly peter out. ming chi kuo of kgi securities often lauded as the most accurate apple analyst is also skeptical about iphone sales. kuo recently raised his 00NUMBER00 shipment estimatefrom his initial forecast of 00NUMBER00 million to a range of 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million but that still implies that sales will be flat or down year over year. so which analysts are right two major factors point toward a year over year increase in iphone shipments. first apples fiscal first quarter has an extra week this year something that happens once every five or six years. in each of the past two years apple has shipped an average of more than 00NUMBER00 million iphones per week during 00NUMBER00. thus the extra week represents a big sales tailwind. second lead times for all iphone models remain significant three weeks after the new iphones went on sale. apples online store is quoting a two to three week wait for most iphone 00NUMBER00 configurations. for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus its an even longer wait topping out at six to eight weeks for the new jet black finish. additionally as of a week ago u. s. apple store locations still had virtually no availability of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus for walk in purchases. in china retail availability is scarce even for the regular iphone 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is out of stock at most retail outlets. image source apple. the apparent shortage of iphones and the reported increases in apples component orders point to a strong demand environment. that bodes well for sales this quarter. however there are two reasons why long lead times and the extra sales week might not translate into a big sales gain. first apple significantly increased its iphone channel inventory last fall boosting shipments. it then had to undergo a painful inventory correction over the next two quarters. to avoid a repeat of that scenario apple may look to exit the current quarter with a lower level of channel inventory weighing on 00NUMBER00 iphone shipments. second low supply may be the main reason why retail stocks are low and online lead times are long. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus adoption is running at a similar rate to last years iphone 00NUMBER00 plus but iphone 00NUMBER00 adoption has been noticeably slower relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00 according to fiksu. whether due to manufacturing hiccups or a deliberate plan by apple to build fewer iphones this fall fewer devices are getting into users hands relative to the last two iphone product cycles. iphone demand is clearly greater than supply right now but that doesnt necessarily mean it is high enough to drive year over year sales growth. its important to recognize that low supply could be making iphone demand appear stronger than it really is. that said iphone sales arent running thatfar behind last years pace while wait times seem to be longer. apple showed two years ago that it can rapidly increase production if demand is better than expected. that process has already begun. with production rising and an extra week of sales it would be very surprising if apple doesnt return to iphone sales growth this quarter. a secret billion dollar stock

particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the june 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to advance 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00

fire for no reason. image source apple. as far as pr crises go it really doesnt get any worse than this. or rather it doesnt get any better than this depending on your perspective. theres nothing more gratifying than seeing your biggest competitor go down in literal flames. over the past week there have been no less than five new reports of samsunggalaxy note 00NUMBER00 units spontaneously combusting. notably these are all replacementdevices that were sent after the company issued a worldwide recall and the problems are still persisting. in some cases the new replacement units arent even charging. theyre just sitting on a table or a nightstand. applenasdaq aapl must be loving it. to say that samsung has botched the launch subsequent recall and second batch of defective units is an understatement. carrier partners and regulators are taking matters into their own hands for the sake of the consumer. the south korean tech giant inadvertently exacerbated the pr nightmare by accidentally sending one affected consumer a text suggesting it would try to slow him down so the company could have more time. oops wrong number. this couldnt come at a better time for apple as the company has seemingly done a good job with upselling customers to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus with the new dual camera system which is one of the larger models headline selling features. the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is apples most direct competitor to samsungs 00NUMBER00 inch galaxy note 00NUMBER00 and the two companies dominate the space for premium phones and phablets. demand already appears to be concentrated on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. quoted shipping times on the larger models are longer and third party inventory checking sites also show little to no inventory for the 00NUMBER00 plus at most locations though there is greater availability of the standard iphone 00NUMBER00. in recent quarters apple has touted increasing android switcher rates as it continues to woo customers from the other side. with samsungs debacle combined with the fact that other galaxy branded devices could be hurt from the fallout apple should enjoy an influx of android switchers. sp analyst angelo zino just put out a research note saying that he expects that apple could grab a whole percentage point of worldwide market share from samsung due to the crisis. that could translate into apple selling an incremental 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million more devices than it otherwise would have in the september quarter. as carriers and regulators urge customers to come return their samsung devices while simultaneously halting sales of affected models theres a good chance that a lot of those users will defect to ios. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds

applenasdaq aapl has updated the displays on its iphone lineup every two generations. every new number iphone would get a best in class state of the art display which would then be recycled in the following years s model where it would still be quite good but no longer class leading. however i believe that going forward this practice largely because of apples ability to more aggressively invest in developing and implementing new generation display technologies will come to an end. instead i expect apple to implement meaningful display performance and quality enhancements with each new iphone at least over the next three years. with that in mind id like to outline the display innovations that i expect apple to bring to market with each of these next three iphones. its been widely reported that apple plans to move away from liquid crystal displays lcds to displays implementing organic light emitting diodes oleds. the shift from lcds to oleds is expected to allow apple to offer phones with displays that curve into the sides like what the samsunggalaxy 00NUMBER00 edge and 00NUMBER00 currently sport. indeed numerous reports say that apple is planning to do just that with its next gen iphones. in addition to the curved displays oleds should dramatically enhance the quality of dark content particularly as oleds allow for virtually perfect black levels unlike with lcds where the color black doesnt look perfectly black particularly in low light surroundings. however the display innovation wont end with the move to oleds. with next years ipad lineup apple is expectedto introduce a faster display technology according to bloomberg. i dont think apple will try to move to a high refresh rate display with the 00NUMBER00 iphone as the company will have had enough on its plate working with its display manufacturing partners to get its first crack at a smartphone class oled correct. however kgi securities ming chi kuo reported a little while back that apple may transition to a curved oled display for its 00NUMBER00 ipad lineup. since apple wont be able to go back with respect to refresh rates this means that apple is planning to introduce high refresh rate curved oled panels with the ipads that well see in the spring of 00NUMBER00. given that tablet displays are likely more difficult to produce as theyre larger and more susceptible to defects if apple has high refresh curved oleds ready for early 00NUMBER00 ipads they should certainly be ready to go for fall 00NUMBER00 iphones. back in 00NUMBER00 apple acquired a company called luxvue that was working on a technology called micro leds. in a nutshell micro leds aresaid  to offer several advantages over oleds including higher brightness greater power efficiency and longer lifespans. a report from digitimes suggested that apple may use micro leds in the apple watch thats expected to make its debut during the second half of 00NUMBER00. if apple can do that then the technology could very well be scaled up to support the larger display size of the iphone for the second half of 00NUMBER00. at the end of the day the display is a critical part of the user experience in a smartphone. going forward its going to become increasingly difficult to persuade users to upgrade to new smartphones particularly if their current models seem good enough. by innovating aggressively on display technology apple will at least be able to make improvements to future iphones that potential customers can see with their own eyes. this could ultimately help apple maintain or even grow iphone sales over the next couple of years even in the face of a slowing smartphone industry coupled with heightened competitive pressures. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

image source apple. its now been six years since applenasdaq aapl embarked upon its journey toward high resolution retina displays. it all started with the iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 which was the first apple product that featured a display so sharp that you couldnt discern individual pixels from normal viewing distances. as soon as apple signaled its intent to pursue retina displays it was only a matter of time before the company would inevitably bring that feature to the rest of its lineup. its still an ongoing transition but apple may complete it soon enough. shortly after the iphone 00NUMBER00 apple expectedly brought retina displays to the ipad family starting with the third generation ipad in 00NUMBER00. that was the same year that apple launched the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro with retina display. the first retina imac came in 00NUMBER00 with a 00NUMBER00 inch 00NUMBER00 display. apple watch is considered retina as well. the mac transition was a little trickier to navigate in terms of adoption though. the larger displays translated into higher costs which led to higher prices and it took more work to sell consumers on the premium associated with high resolution displays. in contrast there was no retina related price premium for iphones or ipads. apple just started shipping them at the same price point which made adoption a no brainer from a consumer perspective. in the years since apple has made progress with getting consumers to adopt retina displays in part because the costs and the related premium have come down. it should be obvious that apples overall goal will be to eliminate lower resolution displays eventually and only sell retina models. in that sense the transition will be complete once apple discontinues any remaining non retina products. that leaves just 00NUMBER00 products to go the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook air the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook air the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro and the entry level 00NUMBER00 inch imac the one without a retina 00NUMBER00 display. with a mac oriented event widely expected later this month the real question is whether or not apple will take the opportunity to discontinue any of these four products. the company recently discontinued its thunderbolt display and rumors suggest that apple may launch a 00NUMBER00 stand alone display at the event. theres no sugar coating this the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro should have died a long time ago. its strange that apple even still sells the laptop which was last updated in 00NUMBER00. it offers such terrible value that its hard to imagine people still buying this aging laptop but presumably people still do if apple still sells it. the macbook air is a different story. the new 00NUMBER00 inch macbook appears to be the spiritual successor but since that product was launched just last year and apple is still likely near the height of its cost curve the ultra thin device carries a hefty premium. its too expensive at this point for the macbook to supplant the macbook air which serves as an entry level laptop. strategically it doesnt seem that apple could discontinue the macbook air quite yet in favor of the macbook but the writing is on the wall. in a generation or two the 00NUMBER00 inch macbooks cost structure may come down enough to replace the macbook air. the same is likely true for the 00NUMBER00 inch imac although this will probably happen sooner. thanks to the shared overall design the added cost should primarily be associated with components as opposed to entirely different manufacturing infrastructure necessary for different designs. my guess is that apple discontinues one of the four remaining non retina products this month the 00NUMBER00 inch pro. the air and imac should follow shortly thereafter once costs permit competitive pricing so maybe well see another one bite the dust next year. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show

if at first you dont succeed in fixing your exploding phone you should probably just stop. samsunghas now made the tough but correct call to completely discontinue all production and sales of its beleaguered galaxy note 00NUMBER00 its fire prone phablet that was launched in august. after widespread reports of devices exploding and catching fire samsung issued a formal recall of 00NUMBER00 million units that it didnt handle very well in the first place. unfortunately for the south korean conglomerate replacement devices were alsocatching fire reinvigorating the crisis. the company didnt have much choice here. the galaxy note 00NUMBER00 is extremely dangerous for consumers and the best way to attemptto minimize damage to the brand is the axe the product altogether. surprisingly samsungs third quarter earnings guidance was pretty solid considering the crisis that it now finds itself in. just a few days ago the company said it expected operating profit to rise 00NUMBER00 despite a modest decline in sales. the initial recall was announced in september so some of the related costs should have been included in the third quarter. but considering the timing of how massive global recalls unfold combined with samsungs massive distribution network of third party retailers and carriers the bulk of those costs should fall into the fourth quarter. however beyond direct costs associated with the recall the real hit is going to be in lost sales. some analysts estimate that we could be talking about anywhere from 00NUMBER00 billion to a massive 00NUMBER00 billion in combined lost sales and recall related costs after everything is said and done. samsung which had established itself as a phablet leader will now have no flagship phablet to sell during the busy holiday shopping season. samsung hopes that it can nudge consumers toward the galaxy 00NUMBER00 and has increased production in light of the note 00NUMBER00 untimely demise. the most obvious beneficiary is applenasdaq aapl which has meaningfully differentiated the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus this year. i was already expecting a bump in iphone average selling prices asps which have been trending lower over the past two quarters following the introduction of the 00NUMBER00 iphone se. starting at 00NUMBER00 the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is the most expensive iphone that apple has ever made. inventory shortages suggest that demand is highly concentrated on the larger model as well. yesterday sp analyst angelo zino estimated that apple could enjoy 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million in additional sales due to samsungs flaming mess. this morning drexel hamilton analyst brian white said it could be 00NUMBER00 million additional units. apple shares have been rallying on the news hitting fresh 00NUMBER00 highs as its biggest competitor falters. the real question will be whether or not samsungs galaxy brand suffers from any lasting damage after the company has poured tens of millions of dollars into marketing to build it. if the brand is permanently tarnished apple will enjoy some upside for a lot more than just one quarter. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the

expeditiously usher users along to the newest version of ios. since the company handles software updates directly and bypasses carrier restrictions apple is able to get people onboard much faster than android. this translates into tangible benefits such as streamlined support of fewer versions while a larger proportion of consumers get to enjoy the latest features including security enhancements. apple has now updated its developer site to show that 00NUMBER00 of devices are now running ios 00NUMBER00. of the remainder 00NUMBER00 are still on ios 00NUMBER00 and the remaining 00NUMBER00 are running some earlier version of the operating system. in contrast the latest android stats last updated on sept. 00NUMBER00 show that only 00NUMBER00 of users are running marshmallow which is a year old. ignoring the fact that it bears a terrible name the latest version nougat is on so few devices that it doesnt register quite yet the first third party device i. e. non nexus to ship with nougat didnt get the version until sept. 00NUMBER00 the day after the most recent android update. kitkat released in 00NUMBER00 is still on over a quarter of all android devices. this version fragmentation has long been a strategic weakness for the android camp but unfortunately for consumers theres really no way around it. the android army is simply too large with too many participants including original equipment manufacturers and carriers to enable efficient software deployments across the entire platform. for apple ios 00NUMBER00 represents cupertinos latest effort to entrench users. this time apple is using a new tool from its tool belt messaging. messages is by far the most dramatically reimagined part of ios 00NUMBER00 and apple wants to make a platform out of it. this is just beginning but its not hard to imagine apple creating an ecosystem of messaging specific apps and services that can integrate into messages increasing overall switching costs and stickiness. many messaging services in asia have successfully pioneered this approach adding everything from customizations to payment options to their respective platforms. meanwhile alphabets google continues to meander with its countless attempts to create a viable messaging platform. the search giant has no less than six different chat apps allo duo hangouts spaces messenger and voice that each serve different purposes on different computing platforms with some overlap. thats just uncalled for although in fairness a few of these are on the way out either explicitly or implicitly. if google cant even streamline its messaging strategy how can it ever hope to put up a fight against apple turning messaging into a competitive platforma secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest

features like an upgraded camera new colors and better battery life helping boost initial sales. while many assumed there would be a lull ahead of the holiday shopping season that hasnt happened for the iphone 00NUMBER00. as a result there may be big things for apple aapl shares going forward. drexel hamilton analyst brian white who rates apple a buy with a 00NUMBER00 price target noted that the third quarter has been stronger than usual for his proprietary apple monitor index. theres also been a positive reception to the iphone 00NUMBER00 in china. combine all of that with the galaxy note 00NUMBER00 disaster samsung is currently experiencing the stars are aligning for apple over the next few quarters. many analysts werent expecting big things from the iphone 00NUMBER00 with expectations that the 00NUMBER00 version of the iphone would be the big reason to upgrade not so anymore. we believe the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus can return apple to iphone unit growth in 00NUMBER00 and full year 00NUMBER00 white wrote in a note to clients. other analysts are saying the same thing about the iphone from which apple derives nearly two thirds of its quarterly revenue. goldman sachs analyst simona jankowski reiterated her buy rating ahead of apples earnings report on oct. 00NUMBER00 expecting a solid beat and raise quarter aided by an additional 00NUMBER00 million iphone units sold. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and particularly the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has been aided by the return of jet black along with a stainless steel apple logo as a color in addition to black gold silver and rose gold. jet black even though it smudges easily and may have some scratches has proven to be extremely popular with a wait time on apples website showing between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 weeks. it seems as if jet black is a return to the iphone as a status symbol when fewer people had it which may be helping its popularity. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has proven to be just as popular and may offer a look into apples future as well. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus basically has a 00NUMBER00 camera showing real time deep depth preview on screens optical zoom at one or two times with a button and ten times via software. andreessen horowitz analyst ben evans postulated apple may be getting closer to virtual reality with this latest advancement. apple shares have run considerably over the past month gaining 00NUMBER00 compared to a less than 00NUMBER00 gain in the broader nasdaq. with the iphone showing no signs of slowing down as we get closer to the december quarter apples most important shares seem likely to keep moving higher providing investors with a good opportunity. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily

applenasdaq aapl iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in either black or jet black. in contrast finding most models of the iphone 00NUMBER00 in stores isnt terriblydifficult. its not entirely clear why the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is in relatively short supply compared with the iphone 00NUMBER00 but i suspect that part of it is due to a customer shift from the 00NUMBER00 inch iphone model to the larger 00NUMBER00 inch iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. its not hard to see why customers might be interested in the bigger phone. the display is sharper packing a pixel density of 00NUMBER00 pixels per inch compared with the 00NUMBER00 of the smaller one although this has been the case for the past couple of generations. and perhaps more importantly the larger one has the differentiated dual camera setup that enables buyers to use a true optical zoom. to put it bluntly the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is simply a better phone than the iphone 00NUMBER00 and it may be the case that an increasing number of iphone buyers are willing to pay more to get a better product. going forward i expect apple to continue to differentiate the larger smartphone from the smaller one in a bid to drive an even richer product mix pushing apples average selling prices gross margin dollars and ultimately profit margins up. the areas in which apple is likely to differentiate its larger iphone from its smaller one are in areas that matter a lot to customers. the camera is a big one as is the display not so coincidentally the two areas in which the company differentiates its smaller and larger iphones today. a report from the generally reliable kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo via macrumors claimed that with the next iphone apple intends to keep the dual lens camera unique to the larger model. given that the dual lens camera seems to be a compelling selling point for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus over the iphone 00NUMBER00 further enhancing the features and functionality of the dual lens camera with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus seems like a smart move. additionally according to a report from nikkei apple is planning to launch not two but threenew iphones next year a 00NUMBER00 inch model a 00NUMBER00 inch model and a 00NUMBER00 inch or larger model equipped with a screen bent on two sides. moreover the report claims that only the highest end model will include a curved oled display the other two will stick with liquid crystal displays similar to the ones found on todays iphone 00NUMBER00 though this isnt necessarily a bad thing given how high quality the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus displays are. the point though is that apple seems to be realizing there are customers who will pay more as long as they receive real value in return. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus for example is 00NUMBER00 more expensive than prior plus models but that doesnt seem to be stopping demand from outpacing supply at the moment. i suspect that next years oled equipped iphone will be priced at quite a premium perhaps starting at 00NUMBER00 and that it will still do very well in the marketplace. apple now has the resources to develop multiple versions of its products to target different price points. weve seen apple go lower with the iphone se and weve seen it push pricing of the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus up relative to the prior generation iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and its predecessor the

quarter earnings report is less than two weeks away. after getting rescheduled because of a scheduling conflict apple is now set to report the results for its most recent quarter on tuesday oct. 00NUMBER00 instead of a previous date of oct. 00NUMBER00. since the company is expected to report its third quarter in a row of declining revenue the pressure is on. when apple releases its quarterly results and provides a business update for investors in the conference call following the release here are five important areas to watch. image source the motley fool. management said in its third quarter update that it expected fourth quarter revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. notably this represents a meaningful year over year decline of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 compared to the year ago quarter. apples recent revenue decline has been primarily due to lower iphone sales during fiscal 00NUMBER00 as the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus struggled to live up to iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus sales. and this will likely be what may drive another decline in the companys fourth quarter. given that apples guidance is usually fairly accurate investors can rely on managements own expectations as a barometer for what to expect when the tech giant reports results. since apples year over year revenue declines have recently been driven mostly by declining iphone sales which is apples most profitable product segment the companys earnings per share have been declining even more rapidly than revenue. in apples third quarter for instance earnings per share fell 00NUMBER00 on a 00NUMBER00 decline in revenue. a similar trend is likely to persist in apples fourth quarter. this is likely why the consensus analyst estimate for apples fourth quarter earnings per share is just 00NUMBER00 representing a 00NUMBER00 decline compared to earnings per share in the year ago quarter and worse than the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 decline in revenue apple management is anticipating. apple management said in the companys third quarter update that it expected gross profit margin in the final fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 to be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 down from a gross profit margin of 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. given that apples healthy gross profit margin is not only critical to the companys uncanny levels of profitability but also a key sign of apples ability to sell its products at a premium price to a large customer base investors should look for this important metric to at least be in line with managements expectations. since iphone revenue accounts for well over half of apples revenue 00NUMBER00 in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months investors might want to check in on this critical product segment. data for chart retrieved from apples quarterly sec filings in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months. chart source author. its difficult to pinpoint exactly where iphone revenue will come in for apples fourth quarter particularly because apple launched its iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus with several weeks before the quarter ended and about a week earlier than it released the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in the year ago quarter. but iphones third quarter year over year revenue decline of 00NUMBER00 along with managements guidance for a decline in total fourth quarter revenue suggest investors should brace for another sharp decline in revenue for the segment. apples revenue guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 may be the most interesting area to watchwhen the company releases its fourth quarter update. it will preview what apple expects from the first full quarter of iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus sales and show whether or not revenue declines could reverse in the important holiday quarter. the number against which investors will be judging revenue guidance is 00NUMBER00 billion. this is the revenue apple reported in its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. apples fourth quarter results will be released on the companysinvestor relationsportion of its website shortly after market close on oct. 00NUMBER00. on the same page investors will also be able to find a link to the apples live question and answer session with analysts to discuss the quarters results. the live conference call is scheduled to start at 00NUMBER00 p. m. pdt. a secret billion

disaster the prevailing sentiment has been that applenasdaq aapl stands to be one of the key beneficiaries. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is a pretty compelling alternative phablet to the note 00NUMBER00 and android switcher rates continue to rise according to apple execs on every conference call. a direct rivals loss should be the mac makers gain rightnot so fast. nomura analyst jeffrey kvaal has put out a research note via tech trader daily that suggests apple may not be as big of a beneficiary as you might think. contrary to popular thinking kvaal does not expect any material upside related to the galaxy note 00NUMBER00 recalls and subsequent discontinuation. the analyst cites strong loyalty among samsung customers based on reports that 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of customers returning a note 00NUMBER00 are picking another samsung device as a replacement. its usually the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge that people are picking. it does so happen that samsung is offering 00NUMBER00 promotions for people to stick with the brand a move that could very well be paying off. on top of that its not like consumers can readily get their hands on an iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which remains heavily supply constrained. while the smaller iphone 00NUMBER00 has better availability the 00NUMBER00 inch model is rather hard to come by and new orders dont ship for three to four weeks. customers that are returning the note 00NUMBER00 need a replacement phone now and cant wait that long. overall kvaal is still quite bullish on apple maintaining a buy rating alongside a 00NUMBER00 price target. in contrast kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo does believe that apple will grab some defectors. kuo is expecting apple to win an additional 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million iphone 00NUMBER00 unit sales from consumers coming off a note 00NUMBER00. the dual camera system could be a strong selling feature and the analyst believes many users will be disenchanted with samsung after the ordeal. these estimates are just the latest guesses to come from the street. earlier estimates ranged anywhere from 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 millionincremental iphone sales that apple could grab. its also not as if well be able to go back and track how many buyers actually did switch so i wouldnt worry too much about the specific unit estimates. still just the likelihood that apple will be able to poach some note 00NUMBER00 users has reinvigorated the broader iphone 00NUMBER00 optimism that has pushed apple shares higher over the past month. the stock is now trading near 00NUMBER00 week highs after stumbling for most of 00NUMBER00. investors have already benefited quite a bit from the debacle. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. applenasdaq aapl is expected to announce its financial results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 00NUMBER00 and more importantly provide a forecast for how it expects its business to perform in the first quarter of its fiscal year 00NUMBER00. the first quarter in every apple fiscal year represents the companys peak quarter as its the first full quarter that incorporates sales of the companys newest iphone models and iphone sales comprise the majority of the companys revenue. apples performance in this quarter tends to set the pace for the remainder of the fiscal year as it typically only does one flagship iphone release in a given year. with that in mind here are three things that apple management needs to address on its upcoming earnings call after market close on oct. 00NUMBER00. it is going to be absolutely critical for apple to let investors in on how the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus are selling in aggregate relative to last years iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. apple has insight into both its build plans and the number of iphones its shipping to its distribution partners known as sell in and it is very likely that the company has gotten enough feedback from said distribution partners to know how quickly those units are being sold to end customers known as sell through. early on in the iphone lifecycle apples sell in is pretty much limited to its ability to crank out the new phones as demand tends to exceed supply. however after a while apples production capabilities improve and the initial surge of demand usually moderates leading to a situation in which supply and demand are in sync or balanced. is end demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of smartphones faring better than that for the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of phones if the answer is yes then that might indicate that iphone demand bottomed with the iphone 00NUMBER00 series alleviating some of the fears that the iphone 00NUMBER00 which outsold the iphone 00NUMBER00 series represented peak iphone. if not then i suspect investors will watch the next iphone cycle very closely as apple is expected to bring a substantially redesigned set of smartphones then. if those devices fail to stimulate demand growth assuming the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus dont do the trick the iphone 00NUMBER00 may truly have been peak iphone. although much of the focus is going to be on how the flagship iphones are doing apple still sells a reasonable quantity of mid range smartphones apple now serves this market with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and low end smartphones apple uses the iphone se here. it would be interesting to hear how demand for the iphone se which apple released back in march to tackle the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 smartphone market is holding up. has this device been able to help push apples share in these price points meaningfully upwardsperhaps more important though would be commentary on how the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales are progressing now that they have seen both price cuts and storage capacity increases. in particular how are sales of these phones progressing relative to how the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sold when they were apples mid range offeringsinsight into sales of these products may make it easier for investors to make educated guesses on how many iphones the company will sell throughout fiscal year 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle is unique in that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is far and away the superior phone to the vanilla iphone 00NUMBER00. the camera is obviously superior on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus likely the biggest selling point for the larger phone over the smaller for most people and the display is sharper while being just as color accurate according to several third party tests. additionally while the iphone 00NUMBER00 seems to be in reasonable supply many iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models are still quite hard to get hold of in a reasonable time frame. though it may simply be the case that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is much more difficult to manufacture than the iphone 00NUMBER00 it may instead be that demand for the 00NUMBER00 plus relative to the vanilla 00NUMBER00 this year is significantly higher than it has been for prior plus models relative to their non plus counterparts. thats something that id like to see apple shine more light on. if higher demand ultimately proves to be the cause apple could be looking at a boost in iphone average selling prices as iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models are 00NUMBER00 more expensive than their iphone 00NUMBER00 counterparts. such an average selling price improvement from a mix shift would be amplified by the fact that this years iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models sell for 00NUMBER00 more than their iphone 00NUMBER00 plus counterparts did when they were apples flagships. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

outlook of a trader or the longer term view of an investor. corporate profitability is after all the most fundamental driver of a stock’s price so it is inevitable that when that is reported wild swings can come about and big decisions must be made. the nature of those decisions is different in each case but over the years i have formulated not so much a set of rules as a series of guidelines for negotiating earnings that i try to stick to. those guidelines are different for short term trades and long term investments. the simplest are for short term trades so let’s start there. guide for short term tradersthe number one rule regarding trading through earnings releases is short don’t do itone of the things that i do these days is mentor a small group of retail traders. we focus on energy products but include stocks in the sector so sometimes we talk about earnings and my attitude usually surprises them. they see the volatility that immediately follows most earnings releases as an opportunity but that is not how i was taught to view it. i spent nearly twenty years in dealing rooms around the world and believe me avoiding running positions into earnings or major data releases is the norm in that environment. for a retail trader who operates at a significant speed disadvantage it is even more important. the point is that traders like to think that at least to some extent they are in control of their own destiny and that is impossible with a position run through a release. there is not or at least shouldn’t be any way of knowing in advance what a report contains so running a position into one is essentially guesswork and comes down to a coin flip. that is not always a bad thing indeed many desk and floor traders would argue that it is true of every trade and the key to profitability over time is to assume that you will get on average only half of your trades right. that way you will set them up to always make more on your winners than you lose on your losers and that is the secret to sustained success. that is done by establishing a stop loss and take profit order at the time you place a trade known as bracketing that trade. the problem when it comes to something like an earnings release is that the already low out of market hours liquidity is significantly reduced immediately after the news and stop losses can therefore be triggered on a false move. even worse and much more common is a bad fill. stop loss orders are filled at the next available price after a certain level trades and in the illiquid markets that follow earnings that next available price can be a long way from the stop loss level. that removes the element of controlled risk that is the aim of a stop loss and distorts the beneficial riskreward ratio that bracketing a trade is designed to ensure. it should be clear then that traders should avoid running positions through earnings and square up before releases. guide for long term investorsinvestors with a long term view however should not square up before earnings. their best strategy is to as much as possible ignore them. when you have a long term investment it is easy in these days of 00NUMBER00 financial news to place too much emphasis on one story or data point. most of the time no one thing has that big an impact it is the collective effect of a number of things that lead to a change in market conditions or the outlook for a particular stock. this is even true for earnings where while a downward trend is revenue or profit should be a trigger to sell one bad quarter is not particularly significant. it is far better to take the buffett approach to a big drop in a stock’s price following one bad quarter of earnings and regard that as an opportunity to buy some more at a discount. a good example of this would be apple aapl. following the only earnings miss in the last four reports by the cupertino giant which came in april the stock dropped precipitously. buying on that drop however would have netted investors a nice 00NUMBER00 profit in the subsequent six months. in general investors should sit tight going into earnings and the maybe act once the numbers are known. traders on the other hand should simply square up before them and come back once the fuss has died down. sticking to these basic guidelines won’t make you rich but it will help you to avoid making costly mistakes during earnings season. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  investorplaceinvestorplace stock market news

reschedulingits fiscal fourth quarter earnings report earlier this month due to a scheduling conflict many wondered if applenasdaq aapl was planning a product event. sure enough the tech giant is set to launch new macs on oct. 00NUMBER00 according to a report from recodeon monday evening. assuming recodes report is accurate the technology news website founded by longtime tech journalists walt mossberg and kara swisher has proved to be a reliable source in cases like this the event will be focused on new macs and is expected to take place at or near apples cupertino campus rather than in san francisco. while recode doesnt specify which new mac models will be updated on thursday rumors in the active apple rumor mill point to a likely launch of new macbook pro models. macbook. image source apple. macrumors expectsthe new macbook pro to get a total overhaul taking some design cues from the new macbookthe new macbook pro is said to include a redesigned thinner body with a flatter macbook style keyboard an oled touch panel that replaces the physical function keys at the top of the keyboard and touch id support. it is expected to do away with the usb a port hdmi port and sd card slot featuring just four usb c ports based on part leaks and it is said to include support for usb 00NUMBER00 and thunderbolt 00NUMBER00. other products that could potentially be refreshed on thursday are apples macbook air imac mac pro and mac mini all overdue for a refresh. assuming apple can begin shipping any announced products soon after its event an oct. 00NUMBER00 product event would be well timed. new macs launching shortly after the event would give apple a fresh new lineup as it heads into the important holiday season. further this would mean apple would get to show off new mac products to customers visiting the apple store to upgrade to the new iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus which were announced in september. its difficult to overstate the importance of apples holiday quarter. it is historically the companys biggest. in apples first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 for instance the company posted a record 00NUMBER00 billion in quarterly revenue up 00NUMBER00 from the fiscal fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00. on average analysts currently expect revenue during the holiday quarter of 00NUMBER00 billion up a whopping 00NUMBER00 sequentially but down 00NUMBER00 year over year. could hot new macs be what apple needs to push total revenue into year over year growth for the quarterat about 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue overhauled mac products could have a small but noticeably positive impact on the companys top and bottom line particularly since the segment is already in need of new products based on declining mac sales in recent quarters. in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 apples mac revenue decreased year over year with segment revenue declining a steep 00NUMBER00 year over year in 00NUMBER00. new macs therefore have the potential to bring the segment back to growth and possibly even give apples overall revenue and earnings a boost. apples rescheduled earnings releasefor its fiscal fourth quarter will take place on tuesday oct. 00NUMBER00 two days before apples rumored product event. will robust expectations for new mac products help apple provide guidance for year over year revenue growth for 00NUMBER00 secret billion dollar stock

favorable trends underneath the surface for aapl in this report. in fact the most accurate estimate for the current quarter is currently at 00NUMBER00 per share for aapl compared to a broader zacks

00NUMBER00 samsunghas downwardly revised its earnings guidance for the third quarter. in this clip fromindustry focus tech motley fool analyst dylan lewis and contributor evan niu discuss how this all happened to one of the largest consumer electronics companies on earth. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on oct. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisevan you want to get us up to speed give us a little timeline on whats been going onevan niu sure. galaxy note 00NUMBER00 launched in mid august. i think that was part of the deal samsung was really wanting to beat appleto market on timing because as everyone knows iphones come out in september. so i think the company was really pushing toward the timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible to try to beat apple to the punch. which is kind of silly because its only a month difference. how much of a difference could that make but apparently that was important to samsung. i think thats partially whats led up to these problems they cut corners or tried to do things too fast. things obviously just werent ready. then as we know in early and mid september we started to see reports of samsung note 00NUMBER00 either exploding or catching on fire a lot of the time while they were charging. in general sometimes you hear stories about this happening. when youre using a third party charger thats not up to spec that can sometimes be the culprit. but these were the official chargers the regular samsung chargers you were supposed to be using. so samsung does this huge recall 00NUMBER00 million units. they think they figured out that its the batteries that they sourced in house from the samsung sdi internal battery division. so they do this recall. they leave all the other phones out there that have different batteries from third party suppliers. they start replacing phones. and now all of the sudden in the past week or two the replacement phones are now catching on fire. laughs so everything is a huge mess and now theyve made the call to officially kill the project altogether. thats a tough call to make but you have to do it when its this bad. its crazy because in modern smartphone times people take this stuff for granted. before this one you hadnt heard about an exploding phone or a phone catching on fire meaningfully in years. at least not at this scale outside of isolated incidences like the third party charger thing i was talking about. but you dont see this wide scale type of thing happening. its been years. i think most consumers have probably thought that companies have figured this out but apparently they havent. its kind of crazy. lewis yeah still running into some issues on the tech side. this is i think brutally bad timing given that the company is basically coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. it seemed like they had a ton of momentum decent amount of growth in the smartphone space. earlier this week when the company decided to go with the full recall they also issued an update to guidance. so we dont even really have to speculate as to what the financial hit might look like we can look at exactly at what the company said here. they are now expecting third quarter operating profit to come in 00NUMBER00 trillion south korean won which is roughly 00NUMBER00 billion down from the original forecast of 00NUMBER00 trillion won. so a decent amount of rollback there. third quarter revenue has also been revised down. its now expected to be 00NUMBER00 trillion won from the previous guidance 00NUMBER00 trillion won. dylan lewis and evan niu cfaown shares of apple. the motley fool owns shares of and recommends apple. the motley fool has the following options long january 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 calls

its new iphone 00NUMBER00 but wall street will be quick to react to any signs of weakness that may arise in the companys quarterly report. in addition to any updates on the iphone wall street will also look for clues as to how strong the companys newest product the apple watch has been selling. even with the stocks recent gains its valuation remains favorable with a pe of just 00NUMBER00. the low valuation suggests upside potential on the back of an earnings beat but wall street will quickly turn against the stock on any signs of weakness so investors should have an exit plan in place just

close attention to the quarters financial results some of the most interesting nuggets in the update may come from the question and answer session following the earnings release. during the conference call when apple ceo tim cook fields questions from analysts here are three questions he may be asked. apple ceo tim cook. image source apple. investors shouldnt get their hopes up for any product specific guidance its apples practice to keep product segment expectations under wraps. but apple executives have previously given at least some background on potential catalysts for iphone and cook typically provides some color on the important product line from a 00NUMBER00 foot view. in apples live earnings call therefore look for cook to update investors on how management is thinking about iphone and possibly even offer a hint as to whether the company expects the key segment to return to growth following the segments year over year declines in both units and revenue in the past two quarters. accounting for 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue in the tech giants most recent quarter the iphone is integral to the companys overall growth trajectory. following a 00NUMBER00 year over year revenue decline for the segment in 00NUMBER00 theres good reason for investors to look for some insight. apples services segment which according to apples financial reports includes revenue from internet services applecare apple pay licensing and other services has become increasingly important to the companys results recently. indeed for two quarters in a row now the segment has been apples second biggest when measured by revenue. in addition revenue in the segment was up an impressive 00NUMBER00 year over year in 00NUMBER00 making it apples fastest growing segment. but is this growth sustainable look for cook to provide some insight into this segments drivers. as apple faces challenges with growing its largest product segment investors have wondered where the tech company will turn to next for growth. many have speculated apple was readying an electric vehicle a move that would obviously open up a new large market to the company. the secret project was reportedly code named project titan and had been underway for several years. but apple recently pivotedfrom aiming to build a car to purely focusing on autonomous driving software according to a report from bloomberg in october. with apple reportedly giving up on its plans to build a car some investors may be wondering if the company has other growth avenues in mind. image source the motley fool. of course apple entered an entirely new segment last year when it started shipping apple watch so wearables is obviously a segment the company is looking to for growth. but with apple watch sales still accounting for only a small fraction of total revenue its not clear yet if this could grow into a meaningful segment for apple. investors should look for some more color on managements expectations for the segment during the conference call. apple will announce its fiscal 00NUMBER00 fourth quarter results after market close on tuesday oct. 00NUMBER00. on the companys investor relations page investors can tune in to a managements conference call to discuss these results at 00NUMBER00 p. m. pdt 00NUMBER00 p. m. edt. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you

buzzing. coming into today one of the hottest points of discussion surrounding apple was iphone sales and the new report has provided us with some updated numbers. todays report will be the first to include sales of the iphone 00NUMBER00 apples most recent addition to its flagship smartphone line. the iphone 00NUMBER00 caused great controversy upon its announcement after apple chose not to include the industry standard 00NUMBER00 headphone jack on the device. iphone sales have typically accounted for around 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue but total sales of the phone have not been consistently climbing like they once did. last quarter apple iphone unit sales came in at about 00NUMBER00 million down 00NUMBER00 year over year. revenues from iphone also fell 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter to a little over 00NUMBER00 billion 00NUMBER00 of total revenue. nevertheless the number of units sold was greater than anticipated which boosted investors confidence. according to todays report apple sold 00NUMBER00 iphone units in the fourth quarter. that represents an increase of 00NUMBER00 sequentially but a decrease of 00NUMBER00 year over year. total revenue from apples iphone unit came in at 00NUMBER00 billion which is up 00NUMBER00 sequentially but down 00NUMBER00 year over year. stocks that arent in the news. yet. you are invited to download the full up to the

off against monstrous iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus driven growth in 00NUMBER00. but the quarters results also included a few bright spots including managements optimistic guidance for the tech giants important holiday quarter. heres a look at the report. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 consensus analyst 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 results retrieved from apple quarterly press releases and sec filings. analyst estimate is based on data from thomson reuters. table source author. overall apples results were about in line with expectations. revenue and eps of 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 respectively were about in line with analyst expectations for the two key metrics. further revenue was within apples guidance range for fourth quarter revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. apples gross profit margin was 00NUMBER00. while the important metric was at the high end of apples guidance range for the quarter of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 its notably down from a heady gross profit margin of 00NUMBER00 in the year ago quarter. the results continued to highlight apples ability to generate boatloads of cash which the company has continued to tap into for dividend payments and share repurchases. we are pleased to have generated 00NUMBER00 billion in operating cash flow a new record for the september quarter said apple cfo luca maestri in apples fourth quarter press release. we also returned 00NUMBER00 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and have now completed over 00NUMBER00 billion of our capital return program. iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus see a promising startwhile sales of the newest iphones were likely limited during the quarter since they were released within only a few weeks of the quarter left and since shipments were supply constrained demand for the device is apparently high enough to impress management. apple ceo tim cook said the company was thrilled with the customer response to the new iphones. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. services revenue growth acceleratedone of the more optimistic takeaways from apples fourth quarter earnings release was the exceptional growth in its services segment. services revenue was up 00NUMBER00 year over year and set another all time record. this incredible momentum as cook referred to it highlights faster growth than the 00NUMBER00 year over year revenue increase for the segment in the prior quarter. iphone revenue was downapples iphone revenue which accounted for about 00NUMBER00 of fourth quarter revenue was down 00NUMBER00 year over year. on the bright side however the year over year decline was an improvement compared to the second and third quarter iphone declines of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. apple forecast first quarter revenue growthfor its fiscal first quarter of 00NUMBER00 or apples important holiday quarter management said it expected revenue to be between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. this range is slightly above apples revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00. at the time of

investors. the motley fool has a disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  i fully understand that most people find it difficult to garner any sympathy for a multi billion dollar corporation or for the multi millionaire ceos that run them but i am genuinely starting to feel sorry for apple aapl and tim cook. it seems that both he and the company he runs are judged by a completely different standard to others. this quarter has been marked by a year on year decline in earnings and revenue pretty much across the board for companies in the sp 00NUMBER00. still in many cases traders investors and pundits alike have understanding that context rewarded companies that have done well relative to their competition or to expectations even if they too have reported a drop in business. when apple reported a decline in revenue yesterday afternoon however it was a different story. the focus was on the fact that for the first time in fifteen years apple recorded a decline in full year revenues. obviously that is noteworthy for a company that was for a long time the poster child for growth but in the context of a sixth successive quarter of overall declines in sp 00NUMBER00 earnings it is hardly surprising and aapl transitioned from a growth to a value stock a couple of years ago. if we keep that in mind and judge the results by the yardsticks being applied elsewhere they hardly justify the 00NUMBER00 drop in the stock that we saw in late trading yesterday and early this morning. those lower revenues matched expectations with profits actually 00NUMBER00 cents better than forecast. margins and iphone sales also beat estimates and the company’s forward guidance was for a return to year on year growth next quarter albeit less than a 00NUMBER00 improvement. in addition when judged against the competition apple excelled. competitors have come and gone but the iphone still reigns supreme and as the holiday season approaches its main rival the samsung galaxy note 00NUMBER00 will be purchased only as a gag gift for mother in laws and the like. joking aside samsung’s problems show what a remarkable feat apple has achieved by increasing the power and functionality of their product continuously and not at least so far uncovering any major design flaws. despite that tim cook certainly didn’t escape criticism and in the eyes of many it seems he simply cannot win. there was significant growth in corporate sales and service revenue which led the naysayers to point out that those were areas that his predecessor steve jobs deliberately avoided. the fact is that the market has changed as we approach saturation of the market for individual buyers in the developed world and cook’s willingness to adapt to those changing conditions is a positive not a negative. if apple were trading at the kind of inflated multiples that were once the case when it was the ultimate growth stock then a big drop after this quarter’s numbers would be understandable but that is not true now. instead what we have is a company that is holding its own in a difficult market environment and continuing to destroy the competition which has the benefit of what looks like very strong demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 to come in the fourth calendar quarter and whose stock is available at a significant discount to the broader market. in that context the criticisms seem unjust and the decline in the stock simply looks like an opportunity to buy cheaply. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. one of the negative storylines to emerge from applesnasdaq aapl fiscal fourth quarter earnings release last night was a notable plunge in greater china revenue. sales in the middle kingdom plunged an alarming 00NUMBER00 which is sure to illicit negative gut reactions. im a big believer in context since context can help you assess relevance. and the broader context here is that apples long term trajectory in china is still heading in the right direction and the short term decline is mostly a consequence of a tough comp. apple crushed it last year in china. for starters heres apples quarterly greater china revenue over the past three years. data source sec filings. fiscal quarters shown. chart by author. theres quite a bit of seasonality built in there and ceo tim cook suggests that investors zoom out a little bitlook at the full year of 00NUMBER00 we were down 00NUMBER00 compared to the fiscal year 00NUMBER00 which was up 00NUMBER00 from the previous year. so if you look at 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 the revenue grew 00NUMBER00 and the cagr was 00NUMBER00 which is really a pretty good result. also as you probably know the fiscal year 00NUMBER00 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 00NUMBER00 so the underlying business performance was 00NUMBER00 down. and so why was it down theres lots of reasons but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 00NUMBER00 in china we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in greater china than elsewhere around the world. and so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 returned to a more normal upgrade rate which would be akin to what we saw with the iphone 00NUMBER00 as a point it had further to fall. and so thats the main reason in our view that you see a difference. so lets zoom out but more than a little bit. data source sec filings. fiscal years shown. chart by author. ignore the year over year comparison for a moment. were talking about a geographical operating segment that brought in 00NUMBER00 billion in fiscal 00NUMBER00. sure thats down from 00NUMBER00 but its wayup from fiscal 00NUMBER00 or prior years. i used to track apples greater china revenue before it began officially disclosing it as a separate segment by triangulating data points and management comments from conference calls. it may shock you to learn that in fiscal 00NUMBER00 just seven years ago apple brought in less than 00NUMBER00 millionin greater china revenue. and look where apple is today. not so bad now is ita secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

wednesday shares of iphone maker apple inc. aapl are falling down around 00NUMBER00 in mid morning trading it dropped as much as 00NUMBER00 earlier as the effects of its fourth quarter earnings resultscontinue to linger. apple reported earnings per share of 00NUMBER00 surpassing the zacks consensus estimate of 00NUMBER00 per share. revenues also beat expectations coming in at 00NUMBER00 billion. however both the top and bottom line fell significantly from the prior years numbers down 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. this marks the third consecutive quarter in which both income and revenue were down year over year. iphone unit salesalso dropped year over year down 00NUMBER00 to roughly 00NUMBER00 million revenues from the iphone declined 00NUMBER00 from the year ago quarter to 00NUMBER00 billion which makes up 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue. mac sales dropped 00NUMBER00 year over year while ipad sales were stable. like before apple did not break out sales for its apple watch. despite these year over year declines apples services segment which includes software and services like apple music apple pay and icloud was a bright spot in its earnings results bringing in 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue up 00NUMBER00. like all retailers the current quarter which includes the holiday season will be very important for apple. the tech giant forecasts revenues in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. it has released many new products recently like the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus as well as the apple watch series 00NUMBER00 and wireless earbuds called airpods the company is also set to unveil new macs in the coming days. these items will surely help apple reach its sales goal as they will likely be at the top of consumers

quarter results last night. shares popped at the sight of better than expected iphone unit sales but quickly gave those gains back after investors saw a few cracks in the numbers. there was quite a bit to digest in terms of the mac makers outlook for the coming quarter which is the fiscal first quarter. lets look at the good the bad and the ugly. guidance calls for revenue in the range of 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. this is a pretty strong forecast considering the fact that the street was expecting just 00NUMBER00 billion in sales and the fact that even the low end of that range would represent a tiny bit of growth from the 00NUMBER00 billion in sales that apple brought in last time around. it wouldnt be much but apple investors should be grateful for any growth these days considering how large the business has become. if apple simply hits the midpoint of revenue guidance it will be a solid achievement and it would break a string of three consecutive quarters of top line shrinkage. the mac maker expects gross margin to be 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. while that would represent a sequential increase of about 00NUMBER00 basis points at the high end analysts were expecting more significant margin expansion in the fiscal first quarter. thats due to a thing that i like to call operating leverage ok other people call it that too. when sales increase companies with operating leverage see margins expand since it can spread fixed costs over more units lowering average cost per unit. this is not unique to apple by any means and some years exhibit greater leverage than others depending on what costs are doing in aggregate but most were expecting rosier gross margin guidance especially since the aforementioned revenue guidance would represent an all time record for the company so you would think it would enjoy more leverage as opposed to less. while revenue may still eke out a gain its quite possible that apple will do so while simultaneously posting a decline in iphone unit sales. this is a business with a lot of moving parts and apple is still severely supply constrained with the iphone 00NUMBER00 particularly the 00NUMBER00 plus. on the conference call ceo tim cook declined to predict when apple would reach supplydemand balance and the company continues to sell every unit that it can make. there are a couple of other factors that could contribute to apple achieving sales growth without iphone growth. the mac has been slacking lately due to an aging lineup which should be refreshed tomorrow and reinvigorate mac sales. theres not a lot of historical precedent for the smartwatch market considering its youth and the apple watch series 00NUMBER00 could potentially throw a curve ball with better than expected sales. services continue to march higher. the market tends to focus too much on iphone unit sales which would be ugly if they fall short but ill take top line growth any way i can get it. a secret billion dollar

why the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus cost 00NUMBER00 more than it used to. image source apple. over the past few quarters applenasdaq aapl has seen a dramatic drop in iphone average selling prices asps. this isnt entirely a bad thing nor unexpected. the main reason for the recent decline was the launch of the iphone se which starts at 00NUMBER00. thats the lowest price point that apple has ever sold an iphone for directly even after taking into account its strategy of cascading older iphone models down to successively lower prices. the iphone se caters to consumers that prefer smaller phones as well as entry level first time smartphone adopters in emerging markets. given the launch a drop in asps makes perfect sense. the good news is that apple expects iphone asps to surge again in the fourth quarter. for the record apple just reported iphone asps of 00NUMBER00 which was a sequential improvement of 00NUMBER00. this trend is expected to continue into the holiday shopping season according to cfo luca maestriiphone asp increased to 00NUMBER00 in the september quarter which was above our expectations. thats up from 00NUMBER00 in the june quarter when we launched iphone se and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. we expect iphone asp to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our asp in the december quarter last year. in the december quarter of 00NUMBER00 iphone asp was 00NUMBER00 apple is setting expectations that investors could enjoy a hefty jump in asps of around 00NUMBER00. heres how iphone asps have performed over the past two years. data source sec filings. calendar quarters shown. chart by author. in 00NUMBER00 apple implemented a new storage pricing structure where the first 00NUMBER00 step up quadrupled storage from 00NUMBER00 gb to 00NUMBER00 gb. combined with the fact that 00NUMBER00 gb is paltry the result was strong upsell activity and a subsequent jump in asps. now were giving back some of those gains for the iphone se. the key to realizing such a meaningful asp jump will be fulfilling iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand. apple says that while demand for iphone 00NUMBER00 is already robust the 00NUMBER00 plus is off the charts and the company is having particular difficulty keeping up. it will also help that this year apple tacked on a 00NUMBER00 price bump for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus which now starts at 00NUMBER00 instead of 00NUMBER00. that increase may seem negligible from a consumer point of view just 00NUMBER00 which is kind of the point. its easily justifiable for the consumer and it will help boost asps to the extent that sales are concentrated on the larger model. when asked about the 00NUMBER00 price increase ceo tim cook attributed it to the new dual camera system that is exclusive to the 00NUMBER00 plus. cook also reiterated that apples goal is always to charge a fair price no more no less. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

comes to research and development expenditures. the mac makers rd investments were so efficient that it was spending a very small percentage of revenue on rd while new products drove incredible revenue growth. it used to be common for rd to be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 of sales at times even under 00NUMBER00 while peers would spend double digit percentages of revenue on rd. what weve seen in recent years is a precipitous rise in apples rd budget as a percentage of sales. data source sec filings. fiscal quarters shown. graph by author. at least one street analyst is a little worried. on the earnings call morgan stanley analyst katy huberty asked ceo tim cook about the divergence of rd growth and revenue growthhubertythats great color. thank you for that. a follow up for tim. what should we read into the fact that rd has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that are rd investments just less efficient than they were in the companys history or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that havent yet come to marketcooktheres clearly some amount of rd that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market and so thats a part of it. and we feel really great about the things that weve got. weve also put a lot of emphasis on our services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. and so were very much were confidently investing in the future and thats the reason you see the rd spend increasing. cooks answer is an expected one as apple is naturally investing heavily in various areas that it wont talk about quite yet such as augmented realityvirtual reality autonomous cars and more. for reference heres a chart of the two growth rates that huberty is looking at. data source sec filings. fiscal quarters shown. chart by author. when it comes down to it the real issue isnt whether or not rd growth outpaces sales growth. those percentages without the context of absolute values dont paint the full picture. huberty is right to pay attention to an important trend since apple spent a cool 00NUMBER00 billion on rd last fiscal year of which 00NUMBER00 billion was stock based compensation. the real question will be whether or not any of the products in apples pipeline can generate meaningful revenue growth in the future. and keep in mind that apples revenue base is so enormous at this point 00NUMBER00 billion that every basis point of growth helps. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

cupertino about such a vehicle. in this clip fromindustry focus industrials motley fool analyst sean oreilly and senior auto specialist john rosevear explain what we know about the potential project and why the company is playing its car so close to the vest. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something

to about todays topic which is dylan lewis over on the techpodcast is going to be mad were talking about apple but not about iphones or computers. were talking about their plans to build a car or lack thereof. john rosevearyeah. heres what we know. apple of course has said nothing about this officially except a couple little hints from people like ceo tim cook. but what we know from reports is that apple for a while has had a team called project titan which is pursuing the idea of building an apple car or maybe an apple car service its never been completely clear. bloomberg came out with a report on mondayconfirming some other things that have come out of silicon valley in the last few months saying apple has scaled this thing way back. initially they planned to build their own car which might have been a futuristic electric car sort of to out tesla tesla. oreillyit would look like a mac mouse probably. rosevearno idea. a lot of the apple senior execs are car enthusiasts. eddy cue is on the board of ferrari. these people are into cars. theres kind of been this project for a long time even steve jobs had talked about it. tim cook said last year the auto industry is an inflection point for massive change which was kind of a big hint that the car is going to be the next device and apples going to play. the hint was they were working on this revolutionary new high tech electric car or possibly a premium apple branded ride hailing service something fully automated. like robot uber only its fully integrated with the apple device ecosphere so it knows your iphone and your ipad and your mac and everything else and it all works the same way. this project had over 00NUMBER00 people on it at one point. oreillywhich makes ones eyebrows pop. rosevearright. even for apple thats a big crew its something serious. theyre spending a good amount of money here. but something changed at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. it looks like senior management decided to scale the thing way back. steve zadesky was a former ford engineer who had been with apple for a while leading the project he left early this year. it was taken over by bob mansfield whos a longtime apple veteran has held all sorts of roles in the company for many years. . . oreillybut obviously no auto industry experience. rosevearright. it was sort of like ok the old apple culture is bringing this back in. the team was told were not going to build a car now. were going to work on an underlying self driving program which is a big shift. john rosevearowns shares of apple and ford.

earlier today. ahead of the unveiling the rumors had narrowed in on three new macbook models and no imac refresh. while new 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pros were obvious it wasnt entirely clear what the other rumored 00NUMBER00 inch macbook would be. some thought it would be a new macbook air with usb c ports. as it turns out it was just 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro instead of a tweaked air. as expected the new macbook pros feature a dynamic display above the keyboard replacing the traditional function keys with a versatile toolbar that can change contextually. apple calls this the touch bar and it can morph into various different tools and buttons depending on what task youre doing or what application youre using. integrated into the right side of the touch bar is a small second generation touch id sensor finally bringing apples fingerprint recognition technology to the mac. this can be used to unlock the computer switch user profiles or use apple pay on the web for websites that have adopted apples payment service. image source apple. intels six generation skylake chips are onboard at long last bringing the macbook pro lineup up to speed in a much needed upgrade. the mac maker is moving toward thunderbolt 00NUMBER00 ports which include support for usb c and a wide range of other protocols. and yes there is a headphone jack. the keyboard is similar to the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook using a second generation of apples butterfly mechanism. naturally this is the thinnest and lightest macbook pro apple has ever made. stop me if youve heard that one before. the surprise move was that apple is making a version withoutthe touch bar and touch id instead using traditional function keys but still within the new chassis. there are also only two thunderbolt 00NUMBER00 ports as opposed to four. the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro that has traditional function keys will start at 00NUMBER00 while the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro with the touch bar and touch id starts at 00NUMBER00. that 00NUMBER00 premium is a hefty ask for what amounts to a small display which is presumably oled based on rumors but apple did not specify and a touch id sensor. all 00NUMBER00 inch models include the touch bar and touch id and start at 00NUMBER00. there was no mention of updates for any other macs. the mac mini is still incredibly old with the last upgrade being two years ago. the mac pro hasnt been updated since 00NUMBER00. there was some speculation that apple would update the imac 00NUMBER00 with new graphics processors from amd but nope. the 00NUMBER00 inch imac 00NUMBER00 already uses the latest intel chips and appropriate desktop class seventh generation kaby lake chips simply arent ready yet. this event was all about the macbook pro. as the most important product within the mac lineup hopefully the new laptops will help apples mac business grow again after losing share for the past two to three quarters. a secret billion dollar

century with a fast easy and completely online process. check out rocket mortgage today atquickenloanscomfool. welcome to industry focus the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. its friday oct. 00NUMBER00 and were talking about activist investors. im your host dylan lewis and im joined in the studio for once  by foolcom senior tech specialist evan niu. evan hows it goingevan niuits good to be in town. lewisits cool to have you here. so pretty much every year we do a writers conference for our foolcom contributors. rather than be skyping with evan i have the pleasure of having him next to me in the studio. hopefully well be able to pick up on our nonverbal cues maybe not cut each other off like we do occasionally when were skyping each other. so i mentioned in the beginning were doing a show on activist investors. really this started with an email from one of our listeners. earlier this week i heard from mark s. he asked recently there have been some rumors that mentor graphics may be looking to be acquired. the company is a major supplier of cad tools that are used by integrated circuit designers and as such are a crucial supplier for all the semiconductor companies. should i as an investor or user be concerned about their looking aroundprior to getting back to mark i did a little homework to see what some of the circumstances surrounding that sale were. there was a fortune article posted a few days ago. mentor graphics company a company that makes software for designing semiconductors is working with bank of america to explore strategic alternatives including a potential sale according to people familiar with the matter. mentor has been under pressure since activist hedge fund elliott management corp reported an 00NUMBER00 stake in the company last month and said shares were deeply undervalued. that seemed like a good point to launch into a discussion about how investors should feel when activists get involved in a company that theyre invested in. i think before we get too far into this conversation lets just take a look at what an activist investor is. evan what do you haveniutheyre usually just in it for the money. activist investors basically pick up a bunch of shares enough to get a pretty meaningful stake in the company to the point where they can get board seats they can get the ear of management they can actually really get in there and try to have some influence because they have that big stake in the company. certainly its easier to do this for a smaller company because it doesnt take as much money to buy a big stake. if you want to buy 00NUMBER00 of a giant company versus a small cap i think its a little more reasonable for the small cap. in this case im not too familiar with mentor specifically but i know theyre pretty small. lewistheyre a 00NUMBER00 billion company. niuright. so its not too hard for an activist investor if they think that shares are undervalued they can pick up a pretty sizable stake for not too much money and try to make some change make some money. lewisand what are we typically talking about when we say changes you see the term strategic alternatives thrown around a lot in those types of press releases. niuusually they just want to maximize the value. that can take a couple of forms like actual changes to the business if they think there are problems with the way the company is run. if they think theres problems with management sometimes theyll try to oust management and get better people in to run the company. other times they might have better input on capital structure. big investors tend to think more about at the fool we always talk about how you have to distinguish between investing in the company and the business of the company. theres two aspects of it. and management is mostly focused on the business whereas investors are more focused on investing financials. of course all companies try to look at both. but some companies arent really good at looking at the financially deep stuff for things like capital structure capital allocation. so in some cases where management isnt as good at focusing on those things i think activist investors can really help in that sense. lewisyeah add some value bring in some of that more financial expertise. some of the other things you might see activist investors push for we talked about capital allocation something they need buybacks dividends realm maybe spinning off specific segments trying to drive value there. but really at its core activist investors see a company that isnt being properly valued and think that they have a way to boost the value through some sort of strategic action. we talked about this a little bit but mentor is not a company that either of us cover all that much. in some ways its kind of a niche within a niche as a semiconductor supplier. so as we talked about this company were going to be looking more broad stroke at their situation and less specific to their financials. standard caveats here that this is not personalized financial advice for mark. but because theyre shopping around and its really at the behest of activist investors i dont see that as a huge problem. its not the same way that twitter is shopping itself around kind of desperate for dancing partner. this is something that we see and its fairly common with activist investors. looking at whats been going on with mentor over the past couple years their valuation right now is a 00NUMBER00 billion company. that puts them pretty much at the height of where theyve been over the last five years. you think about these new shareholders with a huge stake in the company and people who may have owned shares for quite some time their interests are going to be fairly aligned when it comes to a valuation if there is a sale. i think the worry with these types of situations is maybe you bought at highs a year and a half ago and due to whatever poor guidance which did happen in mentor graphics case there was a big sell off in late 00NUMBER00 but they have since recovered. but these activists getting in at a much lower valuation and then being willing to take say 00NUMBER00 premium that undercuts your cost basis and doesnt let your thesis play out on the stock. niuyou never get to break even. lewisyeah you never hit that point where maybe you have something thats more of a three to five year horizon on whatever youre looking to see from the business and activist investors on the flip side might say niuwe want to cash out. lewiswe want to cash out in six months or a year. and then you might not get to see that come to fruition. so thats something to be mindful of. i do think because thats the case here with mentor as an investor and my advice to mark as something to watch would be be less mindful of whats going on on the sale side and pay closer attention to anything management might push in terms of capital allocation or what to do with specific business units. if theyre looking to hold this thats the thing thats going to be most disruptive to the thesis and the business that you originally had when you bought shares. niuyeah. i think certainly if an activist investor is pushing for sale of a company its really hard to say thats not in line with my interests because obviously the stock will go up. but it depends on what the activist investor wants. theres lots of different things they could want their goal could be a wide range of things. but in this case if its just pushing for an outright sale given that the stock is at five year highs i dont think many investors are going to be upset about it having someone on their side that can get more value out of it. lewisyeah. the gains might be less than what they would have been had you let the company play out over that five year horizon but i dont think there are going to be a lot of people who wind up getting kneecapped on their position because of that. in the second half of the show were going to talk about more of the pros and cons maybe talk about a high profile example or two of some activist investors. but before we do this episode of industry focusis brought to you by rocket mortgage by quicken loans. if youve ever bought a home you know how frustrating and time consuming getting a mortgage can be. rocket mortgage

lender licensed in all 00NUMBER00 states nmls consumeraccess. org number 00NUMBER00. evan back to the second half of the show we talked about some of the pros and cons. we touched on it a little bit in the first half. activist investors get kind of a bad rep. do you want to maybe play devils advocate and provide some pros hereniuwhat we touched on earlier i think the big piece is activist investors spend all day thinking about investing and the deep financing of it whereas management spends all day thinking about how to run the business operationally and actually growing the business in whatever the company does. to the extent that the investor knows more about some of the financial aspects it can really bring a lot to the table in terms of if theres something that needs to be improved if you have too much debt and theyre pushing for you to pay down your debt all these different things where a company cfo generally handles those kind of decisions. depending on the cfo and how experienced they are and how cognizant they are because companies have a wide range of how much they value their investors. a lot of companies really value their investors they really value their input they really want to deliver return. other companies dont care as much because theres so many stakeholders in any company lewisyeah you have investors you have consumers you have employees. niuand management and the board. you have all these people. and of course every company is different in terms of how they view and value each of these stakeholders. and obviously there any companies that are very bad about respecting their shareholders. they just kind of do what they want or they enrich themselves. theres plenty of cases of companies that dont really treat investors with a lot of respect generally speaking. so if you get an activist investor that gets in there it kind of forces them to respect the shareholder base in some ways. lewisyeah. to bring it back to the idea of how should shareholders feel if they see this going on in a company that their invested in i think the hypothetical where youre happy about an activist investor hopping in is maybe you love the core business and the market that it reaches and some of the growth potential there but you see management really mishandling things on the financial side. niuexactly. and its hard to know when thats happening but if an activist comes in there  even though it can be distracting for management to have to deal with spending a lot of time catering to whatever this person wants and needs  most of the time i think they do want to be helpful. particularly from the perspective of a public investor most of the time i think its probably ok. theyre trying to help shareholders in general. lewisyeah it might just be that their horizon is a little bit different. i think distraction cues us up perfectly for a discussion on some cons for activist investors. when you said distraction the first thing that came to mind for me was carl icahn and apple. it seemed like when he had a stake in that company every two months we were saying a new valuation. niuand a new letter. lewisi think shares are worth 00NUMBER00 it was just every day in the news thats what they were talking about. that becomes kind of a nuisance for management. niuit is. i think in icahns case hes kind of a ruthless activist investor. he had a big position and of course a big position in apple means 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of the company. lewisyeah i think he was just under 00NUMBER00. niuyeah its single digits. theres no way that anyone is buying 00NUMBER00 of apple. lewiswhich is tens of billions of dollars for that position. niuyeah no one has the money for that. i think in apples case the specific thing that he was gunning after which was this really big push for capital returns lewisvia buybacks. niuright buybacks and dividends. i think that was a very valid cause because apple had been getting criticized for years about that. their cash position had grown ridiculously large unjustifiably. you cant justify having that much cash. again as a public investor youre just sitting there and youre like guys come on you have way too much cash. but a public investor cant do anything about it. thats not to say that apple doesnt know better. i think apple was just being stingy at the time choosing to do that. they had already started a buyback program but icahn came in here and really pushed them to make it bigger and really meaningful. of course they didnt listen to exactly what he said. but i think he was successful at getting them to increase it in which case its definitely a good thing for investors because otherwise investors have no recourse to get apple to start giving back all this money thats just idly on the balance sheet doing nothing earning really crappy returns. lewisand his pitch was basically shares are criminally undervalued and you have all this cash. you should be buying back shares. i think the number that he threw out there was a 00NUMBER00 billion share repurchase program. niusomething like that. lewisweve seen in the last couple years i think he began his position in 00NUMBER00 and exited in 00NUMBER00 he had about a two year holding period. during that time we saw the company acquiesce to that a little bit and decide were going to be buying back shares at a pretty significant clip. it obviously wasnt to the extreme that hed been hoping for. niui think right now they have bought back about 00NUMBER00 billion so far total. which is a pretty crazy number in itself. thats a megacap company. they just bought back a megacap company. but i think in the example of this cash thing specifically having too much cash really does affect some of your financial metrics too. think about for example return on assets. if you have all this cash just sitting out there and your asset number is humongous lewisand youre not returning anything on that. niuright and youre not giving back to shareholders then your net income ratio to your assets is now smaller. so your return on assets return on equity all these important financial metrics that investors look

just when we thought the company was branching out enough it cant seem to stop introducing new proprietary designs for its silicon. there was the 00NUMBER00 that debuted in the apple watch last year followed by the 00NUMBER00 for apple watch series 00NUMBER00. the delayed airpods feature a 00NUMBER00 to deliver wireless connectivity alongside audio playback. all of this is concurrent with the primary a series of mobile processors which will likely start seeing deeper integration of graphics technologyas well. well say hello to the apple 00NUMBER00. for the first time ever apple is bringing touch id to the mac which ive been asking about for over a year. its not as if this wasnt obvious either. after debuting on the iphone touch id was always destined to make its way to the rest of the lineup it was just a matter of when. now that the new macbook pro is getting touch id its also just a matter of time before it penetrates the rest of the mac lineup potentially with a desktop accessory that includes a touch bar and touch id at some point on the horizon. when apple first introduced touch id it went to great pains to emphasize the security of fingerprint data. all fingerprint information would be stored locally on the iphone in what apple called a secure enclave. this was actually a fairly commoditized off the shelf part developed by arm but that didnt stop apples marketing department. but now apple has seemingly actually customized the design for its own purposes and rebranded a new 00NUMBER00 chip that handles touch id and the secure enclave. marketing chief phil schiller describing the new apple 00NUMBER00 chip. image source apple. dont be surprised if apple brings the 00NUMBER00 to other devices in the years ahead including future iphones and ipads. as usual apple didnt disclose much on the technical front. the company instead referred to the new brand in passing and well have to wait for tech teardowns to learn more about the silicon itself. the most important thing here is that apples chip ambitions are only getting greater. thats three new sub families of chips s w and t that weve seen just over the past two years that apple has designed each with a specific purpose within the lineup. eventually it seems that apple will continue this ongoing expansion and its products may eventually consist of a wide range of apple designed semiconductors. longer term that potentially poses a threat to various suppliers since apple is signaling that it wants to do as much as possible in house. there will always be functions beyond apples expertise but suppliers that provide lower level functions better watch out. the most current generation of these chips is now the 00NUMBER00 fusion 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and now 00NUMBER00. when you include apples a chips maybe its not a coincidence that we get s w a t given the tactical nature of the companys aspirations. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company

reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 00NUMBER00 on tuesday and the company delivered its first annual decline in sales over the last 00NUMBER00 years. however there are strong reasons to believe that apple will start growing again in 00NUMBER00 and this could be a powerful driver for the stock. apple operates in the high end segment of the pricing spectrum and its not easy for the company to gain market share against lower priced competitors. since market penetration levels are already quite high in the companys main segment renewal sales are crucial for apple when it comes to generating sales growth. based on calculations from cowen analyst timothy arcuri over the coming quarters 00NUMBER00 of iphone customers will own a device that is older than two years and this could materially accelerate renewal sales in 00NUMBER00. most customers dont upgrade their iphones every year as those devices are generally considered to be good enough and still relatively new. but upgrades are typically much more common once the devices are over two years old. based on data from bmo capital markets 00NUMBER00 of iphone upgraders in each cycle have phones that are two years old or more. this estimate is supported by data from gallup saying that many iphone customers tend to upgrade their devices every two years. according to a 00NUMBER00 survey only 00NUMBER00 of iphone users upgrade their smartphone every year while 00NUMBER00 of users renew their devices as soon as the cellphone provider allows it generally every two years. the remaining 00NUMBER00 of respondents in the survey said that they only upgrade their devices when they stop working or become completely obsolete. the iphone 00NUMBER00 was a spectacular success for apple in fiscal 00NUMBER00. the company sold over 00NUMBER00 million devices that year a staggering increase of 00NUMBER00 versus fiscal year 00NUMBER00. big sales in 00NUMBER00 are a headwind for apple in 00NUMBER00 as most customers own a relatively new device. in the recently completed fiscal year apple sold 00NUMBER00 million units down by 00NUMBER00 versus fiscal 00NUMBER00 but still up 00NUMBER00 from fiscal 00NUMBER00. ceo tim cook said in the most recent earnings conference call that management is thrilled with the customer response to iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and demand for these devices is outstripping supply. its hard to tell precisely what this means in terms of unit sales but its good to know that management is seeing encouraging demand for the companys main product. the iphone may benefit from easier annual comparisons in 00NUMBER00 and the product generated nearly 00NUMBER00 of apples total revenue last quarter. the companys second largest segment is services which produced 00NUMBER00 of revenue during the period with sales growing 00NUMBER00 year over year. the services division will most probably have a sizable impact on total revenue growth in the coming quarters so apples two biggest segments look quite strong going forward. apple management is expecting revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 to be between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. this would represent a year over year increase of 00NUMBER00 at the midpoint of the range. the figure would also be a return to growth since apple has delivered declining top line figures since the second quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00. for the full year 00NUMBER00 wall street analysts are expecting 00NUMBER00 billion in sales from apple an increase of 00NUMBER00 over 00NUMBER00. apple quarterly revenue in thousands of dollars. chart by author. data source sec filings. even if the company is growing at a modest rate an expanding business is clearly much better than a company facing declining revenue. when sales are moving in the wrong direction investors typically wonder if this is just a temporary problem or the business is in permanent decline. after all many companies in the consumer technology space have gone from market leaders to big losers due to increasing competition or changing consumer demand over time. apple is a gargantuan business and it can be quite a challenge for a company of that size to find new growth opportunities which are big enough to move the needle in terms of company level financial performance. on the other hand if apple starts growing again this would materially alleviate concerns about its fundamental soundness which could generate big returns for investors inapple stockover the coming quarters. a secret billion dollar stock

pressure on applenasdaq aapl. the billionaire head of icahn enterprises successfully pushed apple to boost its share repurchase program to return capital to investors. in this clip fromindustry focus tech motley fool analysts dylan lewis and evan niu cfa discuss how icahn got what he wanted. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on oct. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisi think distraction cues us up perfectly for a discussion on some cons for activist investors. when you said distraction the first thing that came to mind for me was carl icahn and apple. it seemed like when he had a stake in that company every two months we were seeing a new valuation. evan niu and a new letter. lewis i think shares are worth 00NUMBER00 it was just every day in the news thats what they were talking about. that becomes kind of a nuisance for management. niu it is. i think in icahns case hes kind of a ruthless activist investor. he had a big position and of course a big position in apple means 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 of the company. lewis yeah i think he was just under 00NUMBER00. niu yeah its single digits. theres no way that anyone is buying 00NUMBER00 of apple. lewis which is tens of billions of dollars for that position. niu yeah no one has the money for that. i think in apples case the specific thing that he was gunning after which was this really big push for capital returns. . . lewis via buybacks. niu right buybacks and dividends. i think that was a very valid cause because apple had been getting criticized for years about that. their cash position had grown ridiculously large unjustifiably. you cant justify having that much cash. again as a public investor youre just sitting there and youre like guys come on you have way too much cash. but a public investor cant do anything about it. thats not to say that apple doesnt know better. i think apple was just being stingy at the time choosing to do that. they had already started a buyback program but icahn came in here and really pushed them to make it bigger and really meaningful. of course they didnt listen to exactly what he said. but i think he was successful at getting them to increase it in which case its definitely a good thing for investors because otherwise investors have no recourse to get apple to start giving back all this money thats just idly on the balance sheet doing nothing earning really crappy returns. lewis and his pitch was basically shares are criminally undervalued and you have all this cash. you should be buying back shares. i think the number that he threw out there was a 00NUMBER00 billion share repurchase program. niu something like that. lewis weve seen in the last couple years i think he began his position in 00NUMBER00 and exited in 00NUMBER00 he had about a two year holding period. during that time we saw the company acquiesce to that a little bit and decide were going to be buying back shares at a pretty significant clip. it obviously wasnt to the extreme that hed been hoping for. niu i think right now they have bought back about 00NUMBER00 billion so far total. which is a pretty crazy number in itself. thats a megacap company. they just bought back a megacap company. but i think in the example of this cash thing specifically having too much cash really does affect some of your financial metrics too. think about for example return on assets. if you have all this cash just sitting out there and your asset number is humongous. . . lewis and youre not returning anything on that. niu right and youre not giving back to shareholders then your net income ratio to your assets is now smaller. so your return on assets return on equity all these important financial metrics that investors look at to judge the performance of the company are now being artificially deflated because you have a ridiculous amount of cash and that cash is not doing anything. so there are a lot of meaningful ways this impacts things. beyond when they start to buy back then you get earnings creation. i think he did a good job in terms of really getting them to do something that needed to be done that was holding them back.

and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  applenasdaq aapl shares fell more than 00NUMBER00 on wednesday following the release of the companys fourth quarter earnings report on tuesday. revenue and earnings per share for 00NUMBER00 both met expectations so investors must be disappointed with the companys guidance for the all important holiday quarter. in fact apple investors should be extremely pleased with the companys guidance. the iphone maker expects to return to revenue growth in 00NUMBER00 after three quarters of decline and its forecast could turn out to be quite conservative. apple is on track to have another great holiday quarter. image source the motley fool. for the current quarter apple has projected that revenue will reach 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion up from 00NUMBER00 billion a year ago. on the one hand its a good sign to see apple returning to growth especially considering that its sales in 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00 were somewhat inflated by an unsustainable increase in channel inventory. on the other hand apple is benefiting from an extra week in the current quarter. that means its guidance actually implies a year over year decline in the weekly sales rate. furthermore apple forecast that its gross margin will be 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 this quarter. that would be down significantly from 00NUMBER00 a year ago and 00NUMBER00 the year before that. this apparent margin pressure also may have spooked investors. to put apples 00NUMBER00 guidance in context its important to recognize that the company faces supply constraints for its new iphones particularly the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. demand for larger iphones has been rising steadily in recent years and the samsunggalaxy note 00NUMBER00 disaster has likely driven even more big screen phone fans to switch to apple. demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is far outpacing supply. image source apple. on apples earnings call earlier this week ceo tim cook bluntly stated that he wasnt sure apple would be able to reach supply demand balance for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus this quarter. by contrast he does expect supply to catch up to demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00. indeed lead times for the iphone 00NUMBER00 have improved significantly in recent weeks. apples u. s. online store lists most iphone 00NUMBER00 models excluding the popular new jet black color as available for next day delivery. in store availability at u. s. apple stores is also rising. by contrast most iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models have a backlog of several weeks online while retail stocks are minimal. cooks tone regarding the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus harkens back to his comments two years ago about the supply demand imbalance for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. at that time he told analysts that supply was not on the same planet as demand. by contrast last year and three years ago cook sounded much more confident on the 00NUMBER00 earnings calls that apple would be able to build enough iphones to meet demand during the holiday quarter. sure enough in both of those years apple exited the first quarter with iphone inventory within its target range. the difference in outlook corresponds to a stark difference when comparing apples results to its guidance. during fiscal 00NUMBER00 and fiscal 00NUMBER00 apples 00NUMBER00 revenue fell within its guidance range while gross margin modestly exceeded the high end of the range. meanwhile for 00NUMBER00 of fiscal 00NUMBER00 corresponding to the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch apple crushed its guidance. revenue came in 00NUMBER00 above the high end of apples forecast while gross margin was 00NUMBER00 percentage points better than the high end of the guidance range. two years ago apple had its most successful iphone lineup ever. image source apple. past performance is no guarantee of future results. that said for great companies like apple its usually a pretty good predictor. apples supply chain prowess is virtually unmatched in the consumer electronics industry. the company also has a ton of leverage with suppliers due to its massive scale. as a result when its biggest challenge is building enough iphones as opposed to finding enough iphone buyers apple typically finds a way to improve supply while boosting manufacturing efficiency to drive down costs. investors still shouldnt expect an earnings beat on the scale of two years ago. at that time analysts had a hard time gauging just how much the introduction of larger phones would increase apples market opportunity. furthermore the supply demand imbalance appears to be limited to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus this year rather than both models in fiscal 00NUMBER00. nevertheless based on apples track record it will probably be able to increase iphone 00NUMBER00 plus production faster than its forecast implies. that could lead to apple reporting 00NUMBER00 revenue and gross margin comfortably above its guidance range. strong demand and tight supply for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus could also help apple maintain its sales and earnings momentum beyond the holiday quarter. that will provide a nice bridge to the introduction of apples 00NUMBER00 anniversary iphone next year an event that could drive the next big cycle of growth for apple. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds

capital expenditures rise precipitously over the past several fiscal years as the mac maker continues to invest heavily in state of the art manufacturing technologies and processes. theres also some retail store renovations and other items such as building out the new apple campus 00NUMBER00 which went over budget by 00NUMBER00 billion a few years ago but the bulk of apples capital expenditures are always allocated to product tooling and manufacturing equipment. following apples fiscal fourth quarter earnings release last week the company has now filed its annual form 00NUMBER00 k with the sec. in it apple says it expects fiscal 00NUMBER00 capital spending to soar to a mind boggling 00NUMBER00 billion. thats an incredible amount of money for a consumer electronics company to spend on capital investments but it shows how committed apple is in pursuing new processes that few competitors could afford. to the extent that apple can use innovative manufacturing processes that rivals are unable to the companys capital expenditures could even be viewed as a competitive advantage. for example design chief jony ive is always happy to share apples design and manufacturing thought processes in marketing videos. this year the new jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 required a handful of new techniques the process sounds ridiculous. or consider the equipment that apple must buy to rigorously test the apple watch series 00NUMBER00 to simulate how the device will perform for everyday swimmers. apple watch series 00NUMBER00 testing which runs watches 00NUMBER00 hours per day for weeks. image source apple. all of this stuff costs a ton of money. its true that apple actually expected to spend a comparable 00NUMBER00 billion in fiscal 00NUMBER00 but it turns out that fiscal 00NUMBER00 capital expenditures came in at just 00NUMBER00 billion. in fact apple usually goes under budget relative to its capital spending guidance. in the past four fiscal years only one year came in on target while the rest came in under budget. data source sec filings. fiscal years shown. chart by author. so theres still a decent chance that apple is just being conservative here and will end up spending less than it anticipates. however just imagine how high the capital expenditures would soar if apple planned on actually building a car a plan that it has seemingly backed away from. maybe its the wholebuilding cars destroys capital like nothing else on earththing. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall

are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  ceo tim cook introducing new macs at the october event. image source apple. im on record as being a huge fan of applesnasdaq aapl capital return program. not only is the program highly accretive to earnings due to its sheer size but it also improves certain performance metrics such as return on assets roa and return on equity roe by reducing the denominators in those equations. prior to the programs implementation apple truly had accumulated far too much cash on the balance sheet that was doing absolutely nothing and ceo tim cook finally addressed long standing criticisms around capital efficiency by starting to give it back to shareholders. but at the same time you also dont want to give too muchback. apple has found the right balance on how much capital to return. free cash flow is already an important metric for investors to watch particularly any company that has meaningful manufacturing operations. even if the labor is outsourced to contract manufacturers like it is in apples case the company still has to spend heavily on infrastructure and tooling equipment. to determine the cash that apple pays for capital expenditures you add up two line items on the cash flow statement payments for property plant and equipment ppe and payments for intangible assets. once you subtract this total from operating cash flow you get free cash flow. data source sec filings. fiscal years shown. chart by author. in the context of capital returns dividends and share repurchases inevitably come out of free cash flow and free cash flow is necessary to support ongoing investments needed to sustain the business. this why its useful to compare capital returns to free cash flow. data source sec filings. fiscal years shown. chart by author. it should be intuitively obvious that returning greater than 00NUMBER00 of free cash flow is unsustainable in the long run apple actually did this in fiscal 00NUMBER00 returning 00NUMBER00 of free cash flow. the good news is that in the two fiscal years since apple has brought this percentage down to a more sustainable level. apple returned 00NUMBER00 of free cash flow in fiscal 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 of free cash flow in fiscal 00NUMBER00. a comfortable level is anywhere in the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 range. of course these are based on consolidated financial results and apple funds the majority of its capital return program with debt issuances that arent tied directly to operating cash flow or free cash flow. so its worth acknowledging that the companys capital return program is also a function of its ability to continue raising debt apple now has nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in long term debt unless theres a tax repatriation holiday that allows some of that money mountain to come back to the u. s. this also helps investors know what to expect in april when apple gives its annual update to its capital return program. for instance heres how apple has boosted its share repurchase authorization since 00NUMBER00. yearincrease in buyback 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billiondata source sec filings. since operating cash flow and thus free cash flow declined in fiscal 00NUMBER00 and is unlikely to unexpectedly soar in fiscal 00NUMBER00 i wouldnt expect another massive increase in the share repurchase authorization this coming april. as of right now apple has approximately 00NUMBER00 billion remaining on the current authorization and has been buying back an average of 00NUMBER00 billion of shares per quarter over the past year. so by the time april rolls around apple should still have a decent amount of authorization remaining so i would expect it to lean toward the conservative side of its historical increases. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt

explanation for that precipitous declinealso as you probably know the fiscal year 00NUMBER00 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 00NUMBER00 so the underlying business performance was 00NUMBER00 down. and so why was it down theres lots of reasons but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 00NUMBER00 in china we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in greater china than elsewhere around the world. and so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 returned to a more normal upgrade rate which would be akin to what we saw with the iphone 00NUMBER00 as a point it had further to fall. and so thats the main reason in our view that you see a difference. lets give apple back the 00NUMBER00 currency related impact. that of course still leaves a business that dropped 00NUMBER00 year over year. the hypothesis that the unusually strong iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle led to a pull in of demand that otherwise would have been satisfied during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle also seems reasonable rightno its not. ill even take it a step further and call it a deflection from the underlying problem. per a fresh reportfrom strategy analytics shipments of smartphones in china grew a healthy 00NUMBER00 annually from 00NUMBER00 million units in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 million in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. strategy analytics also pointed out that apple managed to grab only 00NUMBER00 of the market during the third quarter of 00NUMBER00 plunging from the 00NUMBER00 share it captured in the year prior. just so were clear the overall market for smartphones grewbut apples unit shipments managed to fall. that alone suggests market share loss but the magnitude of the market share loss that were talking about is enormous a full 00NUMBER00 drop. when a company sells fewerunits in a growingmarket and sees its market share cut nearly in half year over year there is much more going on than an upgrade cycle thats being pulled in this is a fundamental deterioration in the demand for apples products relative to the demand for products from its china based competition. the worst thing apples executives can do is convince themselves that plunging share in a key growth market is due to a pull in of a product cycle. this kind of thinking will allow apples management team to believe that its china problems arent due to its own execution but rather to forces outside its control. thats a dangerous way to think because it means the company wont take the appropriate steps to try to fix the issue. so whats the underlying problemapple releases one new pair of flagship smartphones each year. if those phones prove to be sufficiently better than what the competition has in the market then apple can get by selling those models for a full year. if those models dont deliver a compelling set of features both in absolute terms and relative to what the competition is selling then apple and its shareholders are stuck paying the price for the entire year. thats what i believe happened with the iphone 00NUMBER00 series smartphones which were outgunned in several key ways by devices offered by chinese smartphone vendors well before apple had the opportunity to launch the arguably much better positioned iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones. the good news for apple is that the iphone 00NUMBER00 series devices are exceptionally good products that appear to be much more differentiated relative to the competition than the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones were relative to their contemporaries a year ago. the bad news is that even though the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones are phenomenal the major china based smartphone makers dont release new devices once per year they release new flagships approximately every six months giving them the opportunity to catch up with or even surpass apple in areas that consumers care about. apple on the other hand must wait until the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones launch next fall before it can respond to what those fast moving china based smartphone vendors put out. i believe the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones will hold up quite a bit better than the iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones did but its not clear if theyll be enough to allow apples iphone business to perform in line with the china smartphone market let alone outperform it. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to

disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  on applesnasdaq aapl most recent earnings call one analyst observed that even in the face of a 00NUMBER00 generation over generation increase in price for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus relative to the prior generation iphone 00NUMBER00 plus the former is completely sold out. image source apple. this led the analyst to ask apple ceo tim cook the following questionas you see more and more features being added into iphones do you conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point where raising asps average selling prices further would be net disruptive to demand or do you see more room to raise asps over time as you add incremental featurescook answeredwith the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus we put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. and so were getting an incredible amount of feedback there. we also get incredible feedback on the iphone 00NUMBER00. and but the mix that we projected on iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is short of what the reality is and so we are chasing supply there. in terms of the asp the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we dont want to charge more than that and we think its worth being fair. based on the commentary from cook around apple wanting to charge a fair price for its products including its iphone products it might seem as though hes saying that the company is going to try to keep its iphone average selling prices relatively flat going forward. if you read between the lines a little bit though thats likely not the message he intended to convey. to understand what cook is trying to convey here its important to understand what a fair price means in this context. fair doesnt mean well cram in way more features than we did last year balloon our cost structure and then sell you the device for the same price that we sold last years model. that wouldnt be fair because apple winds up selling something thats much more expensive to manufacture while not getting paid for that innovation. on the flip side if apple were to build a successor to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus next year lets call it the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and it didnt add any significant new features aside from the generally expected improvements in processor and wireless connectivity speeds and cost about the same to build it wouldnt be fair for apple to jack up prices generation over generation either since the value just wouldnt be there. the way to think about a fair price is this if apple delivers a significant step up in relative value compared to what it delivered with prior generation products such steps up are often accompanied by commensurate increases in manufacturingcomponent costs then its ok for the company to charge more. if it doesnt deliver such features in a next generation product then a fair price would likely be what the company charged last time. going forward i suspect that apple will more aggressively segment its product line particularly with its iphone product line especially considering a recent nikkei reportclaiming that apple is planning three iphone models next year including a premium variant. indeed i expect apple to continue to deliver solid improvements at the typical iphone price points but it also stands to reason that the company will experiment with bringing more feature packed devices to even higher end price points. additionally earlier this year apple introduced the relatively low cost 00NUMBER00 inch iphone se aimed at more budget buyers. i dont expect apple to be as aggressive in building products for lower price points especially as being too aggressive there could lead apple to participate in a painful race to the bottom but putting out products like the iphone se from time to time is probably a smart move. at the end of the day apples job is to make sure to deliver great products that encourage smartphone buyers to choose its devices and if possible choose the higher priced models in its portfolio. apples seemingly done a good job here with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and itll be interesting to see if the company can build upon this strategy in the product cycles ahead. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a

2016-11-02 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.1894547444983068,0.2254787183986353,0.0007480114199038,games are the most popular category in the app store where apple only recognizes the net commission that it earns through the agency model. image source apple. in january of this year apple inc. nasdaq aapl did something peculiar. the mac maker introduced a new non gaap metric called installed base related purchases. the new metric was provided since apple accounts for content sales in different ways depending on if its using the wholesale model or the agency model. itunes purchases have historically used the wholesale model apple recognizes the full gross transaction amount while third party apps sold on the app store used the agency model apple recognizes only the net commission that it keeps. installed base related purchases represented the gross dollar amount of content that users were purchasing irrespective of the underlying accounting. at the time apple also used the opportunity to point to a different non gaap metric of constant currency revenue growth in order to contextualize the havoc that the strengthening dollar was causing on the reported results. while apple quickly stopped using constant currency revenue growth it continued to report installed base related purchases in what i viewed as a concerted effort to shift investor focus away from iphone unit sales toward recurring services revenue. until now. there was no disclosure of installed base related purchases when apple reported its fiscal fourth quarter results last month. management didnt even mention it on the call. the absence of this disclosure was unexpected since apple had introduced this metric so recently. combined with the year over year comparisons investors could start to form a picture of how this metric was trending. as a finance nerd i must admit that i was actually looking forward to completing the picture to see how installed base related purchases fared over the past couple years. apple previously provided data for the first three fiscal quarters for 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. fiscal quarterinstalled base related purchases non 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 source apple. apple also gave the total for fiscal 00NUMBER00 and fiscal 00NUMBER00. fiscal yearinstalled base related purchases non 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billiondata source apple. using the full year fiscal 00NUMBER00 total we can derive the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 figure to be 00NUMBER00 billion. this is what we get. data source apple. chart by author. fiscal quarters shown. while we dont have the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 number we can say that that the first three quarters of fiscal 00NUMBER00 alone generated more digital content sales 00NUMBER00 billion than all of fiscal 00NUMBER00. the more important question for investors to ask is whydid apple stop disclosing this non gaap metric did management suddenly deem this metric to be not useful after all the original rationale for creating it was apple considers non gaap installed base related purchases to be a useful metric for investors and management as it provides a more complete picture of the transactions generated by the installed base. its unlikely that there is some troubling trend in content purchases that apple is trying to hide either. its completely true that the use of non gaap financial metrics has gotten out of hand in recent years. perhaps the culmination of this abuse actually occurred years ago when a freshly public daily deals company wanted to start reporting adjusted consolidated segment operating income before the sec stepped in and said it was just ridiculous. well the sec has stepped in throughout 00NUMBER00 and warned public companies to back away from non gaap metrics cracking down on a number of companies across many industries with strongly worded letters. for the most part apple has been a strong role model in terms of avoiding non gaap metrics. before this year the last time that apple used non gaap metrics was when it was required to account for iphone sales using the subscription model which went away in 00NUMBER00. the company still includes non cash costs like stock based compensation likely the most popular exclusion in non gaap figures in its results. its possible that apples move away from non gaap metrics is merely conservatism with how it reports to the sec but im still curious. a secret billion dollar stock

outpaced supply particularly on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. apples jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is in high demand. image source apple. later in the call when asked by an analyst whether the company expected to reach supplydemand balance by the end of the quarter with respect to both iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus cook saidits hard to say. i believe that on iphone 00NUMBER00 we will. on iphone 00NUMBER00 plus im not sure. i wouldnt say yes at this point because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus versus our forecast going into the product launch. for apple the fact that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is selling better than expected compared with its expectations relative to the iphone 00NUMBER00 is both a blessing and a curse. heres why. the good news for apple is that if the mix of iphone 00NUMBER00 plus it sells relative to iphone 00NUMBER00 remains significantly higher throughout the current product cycle then apple could be looking at a not so trivial boost in average selling prices. in the past apples plus models would sell for a 00NUMBER00 premium relative to their regular sized counterparts already a hefty premium. this year each iphone 00NUMBER00 plus model sells for a full 00NUMBER00 more than the corresponding iphone 00NUMBER00 model so the potential average selling price upside this year from a mix shift toward the plus is much greater this time around than it was in prior cycles. indeed had the mix of demand between the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus simply remained constant relative to prior generation models which is probably what apple had planned for as past performance is arguably the best indicator of future performance the 00NUMBER00 increase alone would have helped apples iphone average selling prices. but the combination of the higher average selling price andricher mix of unit shipments could prove quite a boon for the idevice makers iphone revenue. in a nutshell the richer than expected mix of plus sales combined with the price increase on this years plus models relative to those from the last two product cycles is obviously good news for apple. robust demand for higher priced devices is good news but if the company cant satisfy it in a timely fashion that could potentially be bad news. ideally any demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus that ultimately cant be met during the current quarter would just be pushed out to the following quarter. i suspect that this will be the case for most of the demand thats unmet during the quarter but not for all of it. indeed many of apples competitors release new flagship devices in the february march time frame so if a customer is stuck waiting too long to get his or her hands on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus he or she may simply decide to wait and see what the other smartphone vendors bring to the table lowering the odds that this customer will ultimately choose an iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. in a nutshell for apple to maximize its iphone revenue in 00NUMBER00 it has to crank out more iphone 00NUMBER00 plus devices as quickly as possible. a secret billion dollar

last week. now a noted apple analyst is predicting the company will move to address some of the issues in a 00NUMBER00 update including a price cut to boost sales. apple unveiled the new macbook pro at an event last week focusing on the new touch bar feature and a smaller form factor. however the reaction from the professional users who form the core base of macbook pro buyers was tepid at best. the list of complaints about the new laptops has only been growing since the event. aapls decision to eliminate all legacy ports and the magsafe power port replacing them with four usb c ports is proving contentious as is the switch the new keyboard introduced with the macbook last year. capping maximum ram at 00NUMBER00 is frustrating many power users and adding insult to injury the new laptops come at a hefty price increase compared to outgoing models. one blog where professional and creative users have been venting is full of pronouncements like this one the people at apple no longer have a clue what is desirable in a computer. at this apple is now incompetent. tim cook thinks everyone should just use an ipad. 00NUMBER00 hottest gadgets for the 00NUMBER00 holiday shopping seasonin other words the reaction has not been what aapl was hoping for. apples mac sales had already been on the decline going into the event as potential buyers held off in anticipation of the new computers. judging by the online reaction many of those aapl customers are not happy and they may well forgo buying the new macbook pro. apple insiderreports kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo is calling for sales of the old macbook models to remain steady in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. however he is predicting slow demand for the new macbook pro to be a drag on sales resulting in a 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 decline in overall shipments compared to 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. while the first half of 00NUMBER00 doesnt look good for aapl things may get better. time is on the companys side in the sense that accessory makers are slowly boosting their usb c offerings. with a growing selection of usb c products which offer considerably faster throughput than their predecessors some of the controversy over axing all the new macbook pros legacy ports will likely die down. the touch bar seems likely to be a factor as well. its being written off as a gimmick by some but six months of having it available may result in the feature being put to good use by software developers. kgis kuo notes that aapl has a historical pattern of pricing new laptops at a premium at launch then lowering the price the following year. hes predicting apple will announce price drops for the new macbook produring the second half of 00NUMBER00. hes also predicting a refreshed model that will go past the current 00NUMBER00 ceiling offering support for 00NUMBER00 of ram. apple inc. aapl stock facing backlash over new macbook profor the past decade apple could do no wrong so far as its core users were concerned and as a result its pc sales defied the industry slump. but its latest moves the new macbook pro axing the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook air the single port macbook dropping apple branded monitors are causing many to rethink their loyalty. many of these customers have also been waiting for the next generation imac and mac pro to arrive. increasingly it seems as though 00NUMBER00 may turn into a

history. apples new macbook pro with touch bar. image source apple. and we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new macbook pro than any other pro notebook before said apple marketing chief phil schiller in an interviewwith the independent this week. so there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. of course its not entirely surprising the new product is selling well. sporting apples new touch bar or a multi touch enabled strip of glass built into the keyboard for accessing customized app specific tools on demand apples new macbook pro represents a significant step in innovation for apples pro series of laptops. but in light of the products criticism in the media some may have questioned whether demand for the new product would be limited. apples new macbook pro is equipped with four usb c ports and a headphone jack. image source apple. the media has criticized apples decision to remove so many ports in favor of a sleeker design and usb c. apples removal of the sd card slot in particular has been a subject of criticism. often used for transferring large files of photos and videos from cameras to computers the sd card is still commonly used by photographers. so far however record macbook pro sales suggest consumers seem to be overlooking any negative effects of apples port killing spree. maybe consumers can relate with schiller who told the independent that apple believed the slot was cumbersome. heres exactly what schiller said when the independent asked schiller why the company removed the important slot. because of a couple of things. one its a bit of a cumbersome slot. youve got this thing sticking halfway out. then there are very fine and fast usb card readers and then you can use compactflash as well as sd. so we could never really resolve this we picked sd because more consumer cameras have sd but you can only pick one. so that was a bit of a trade off. and then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. thats proving very useful. so we think theres a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want or do wireless transfer. however consumers feel about the sd card less macbook pro apple will likely continue killing off ports for years to come. ever since apple controversially ditched the floppy drive in 00NUMBER00 the company has continued to eliminate numerous ports swiftly and early. other important ports to get the ax early on include the disc drive and the 00NUMBER00 pin connector. and the september launch of an iphone 00NUMBER00 without a headphone jack confirmed the tech giants ambition for moving toward a wireless future. killing off ports has worked out handsomely for apple in the past and the sd card slots eradication from macbook pro laptops will likely pan out similarly for the company even if it disappoints some customers in the near term. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds

has been pretty monumental for didi chuxing. the china based ride hailing company has expanded its services to 00NUMBER00 cities across china secured 00NUMBER00 billion in fundingfrom apple saw its valuation rise to 00NUMBER00 billion and bought uprival ubers business in china. but 00NUMBER00 isnt over yet and didi has more to accomplish. the companys president jean liu has twice announced this month that the company is planning to venture out of china and into the global market. at v anity fairs new establishment summit earlier this month liu said the company is definitely going global and then at the wall street journals wsjd live technology conference later in the month liu again said we intend to go global. we aspire to be a global company. that sounds all well and good but what does it actually mean for didi liu gave some sparse details at the vanity fair conferencewere a big sponsor and big believer in local players. if there are no existing local players well go there by ourselves. we will play a global game. essentially didi is looking to bring its own form of ride sharing to other unspecified countries or partner with local companies that already exist in certain markets. many companies both large and small aspire to reach beyond their own countrys borders but there are few things didis doing that could make its current ambitions a future reality. theres no sure path for didis global success of course but there are a few good indicators. first the company is already in partnerships with a few ride sharing players around the world. didi is a key investor in the southeast asian ride hailing company grab and was part of a 00NUMBER00 million round of funding last year. investing in grab gives didi access to thailand the philippines indonesia vietnam singapore and malaysia. there have been rumors that didi might just end up buying grab outright which would instantly propel didi into the world market. but even if it doesnt go that route didi should still be able to glean some of the inner workings of ride hailing services in southeast asia from the relationship. then theres the companys relationship with ola in india. the company raised 00NUMBER00 million in late 00NUMBER00 from a handful of investors one of which being didi. ubers new 00NUMBER00 stake in didi makes the latters ola investment a bit of an awkward relationship considering uber and ola are huge rivals in india. nevertheless didis investment in ola gives the company a stake in olas business which is already in more than 00NUMBER00 cities across india. and finally theres didis relationship with lyft. didi invested 00NUMBER00 million in the company just last year and also partners with lyft to let its customers use the didi app to hail a lyft in the u. s. and let lyft customers hail didi cars when in china. lyfts future with didi has been a bit up in the air since didis purchase of ubers china business. but at the wsjd conference this month liu said that theres a very good chance it would partner with lyft for its global ambitions. how exactly itll do that still remains unclear. with didis strong partnerships and investments in key ride sharing companies around the world its not hard to imagine the company expanding into those markets by either purchasing a company outright or if it wanted even more complicated relationships than it has now entering a market itself where one of its partners already exists. while didi isnt shedding lots of light on its global plans right now its still very clear that its presence in other countries through its investments is growing and it could easily parlay that into new opportunities. didi already serves up 00NUMBER00 million rides every single day in 00NUMBER00 cities throughout china. the company says it processes 00NUMBER00 terabytes of data every day and can predict up to 00NUMBER00 minutes ahead of time where itll need its drivers to be with 00NUMBER00 accuracy. thats no easy feat and its an impressive use of data that likely can be applied in other markets. if it chooses to do so we may just see didi chuxing dominate other countries in the same way it took down uber in china.

reflect those of nasdaq inc.  the new macbook pro with touch bar and touch id. image source apple. its no secret that apple inc. nasdaq aapl cares a lot more about its laptops than it does its desktops. the company consciously focuses its development efforts and innovation on macbooks over imacs mac minis or mac pros. new features and technologies almost always start in apples laptops before often making their way to the desktop. for example apple introduced its desktop trackpad after adding more and more gestures to macos as it focused on touch based interactions. considering the dominance of laptops in apples unit volumes this is entirely expected and rational. apple stopped breaking down its mac units by category a few years ago starting in fiscal 00NUMBER00. but up until fiscal 00NUMBER00 it was pretty clear what category was driving sales laptop sales outnumbered desktop sales by 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. data source sec filings. fiscal quarters shown. chart by author. this trend has likely continued in the years since. so yeah apple puts a lot more emphasis on macbook innovation. with that in mind how will apple bring its new touch bar and touch id to desktop macsit goes without saying that if apple wants to bring touch bar and touch id to desktops it will need to integrate the oled panel into its own keyboard accessories. a stand alone bar without the keyboard would just be ridiculous and hard to use. but there are some technical considerations to acknowledge when adding a display. apple cant just slap a display on an existing keyboard and call it a day. since the touch bar is a display that dynamically changes based on context it would be tricky to implement on a wireless keyboard because of potential latency issues associated with trying to transfer data wirelessly to the display. while the touch bar uses oled technology which is more power efficient than lcds since no backlight is required displays still use quite a bit of energy. a wireless keyboard with a touch bar would need to be charged more frequently due to increased power consumption. additionally apple is using a new custom designed 00NUMBER00 chipto power the touch bar as well as to securely store touch id fingerprint data. that requires even more power. adding an oled display and the extra processing power would also jack up the price in a big way. the seemingly obvious solution here is to make a wired keyboard which would address all of these challenges. but apple has been touting a wireless future across its lineup for years most prominently with the removal of the iphone 00NUMBER00 headphone jack. introducing a wired keyboard with touch bar and touch id could be perceived as a philosophical step backwards. do you remember when apple first introduced touch id in the iphone 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 it was an inevitable addition following apples 00NUMBER00 acquisition of authentecfor its fingerprint sensor technology. initially there werent many uses for touch id but in the years since users have grown accustomed to the added convenience and security. we arguably take for granted how easy it is to unlock our phones or pay for things now. touch id cant entirely replace alphanumeric passwords yet but apple has been trying to kill the passwordfor years. the new macbook pro with touch bar and touch id. image source apple. more broadly the tech industry has been pushing for a transition away from passwords as well. the fast identity online fido alliance was created for precisely that purpose. fido helps develop technical specifications that are open and scalable with the goal of improving online security and its member listis a whos who of technology finance and payments companies. apple is not a member and its not clear why since it would be an influential addition. fast forward and imagine a future where all websites and apps adopt standardized protocols to login and pay using secure biometric fingerprint data which was once only available in enterprise applications that were willing to pay for added security. this has yet to be done on a consumer level at scale but its clearly where were headed. nothing will ever be 00NUMBER00 secure but the potential upside in convenience and security relative to the status quo is enormous. to get there touch id must be available on both laptops and desktops. eventually apple will need to figure out a way to bring touch id to desktop macs despite the technical challenges it needs to solve first. a secret billion dollar stock

incredible success in the smartphone market and vows to beat the cupertino giant no matter what. that perfectly describes south korean conglomerate samsungs mentality at the start of the decade but it now also encapsulates chinas huawei. reutersreported yesterday that huawei ceo richard yu has aspirations of becoming the no. 00NUMBER00 smartphone manufacturer in the world a spot currently occupied by apple. huawei isnt too far behind apple and is catching up. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 unit volumeschange 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 source idc. yoy year over year. huawei only entered the smartphone market about four years ago historically making its money on network equipment for telecommunications companies. yu promised to keep up with apple in terms of innovation while also dropping some buzzwords that the company would also be pursuing. half a decade ago samsung became completely obsessed with beating apple. remember the internal memo circulated in september 00NUMBER00 emphasized goal of next year beat apple so much effort at the company was dedicated to beating the cupertino company at its own game even if that meant shamelessly replicating its products and designs. for example as part of the patent infringement lawsuit there was a 00NUMBER00 page document from march 00NUMBER00 uncovered that was completely dedicated to copying the interface and software features of the iphone for the galaxy 00NUMBER00 which included directions for improvement on how to mimic apple. image source court documents. more recently its precisely this obsession with beating apple that caused samsung to cut corners and rush the galaxy note 00NUMBER00 to market in order to launch a month before the iphone. we all know how that turned out. samsung has known for quite some time that building a business thats based on really good hardware and little else is vulnerable as it could be supplanted by the next big hardware player. huawei has started to release some very strong phones in china and is eyeing continued international expansion. this is why samsung has tried very hard to expand its software capabilities but it has little to show for it. headlines like huawei is the new samsung probably dont reassure the south korean company much either but its also a testament to huaweis progress in entering the consumer smartphone market even if huawei is also using a copycat strategy. the reality is that competing for unit market share is something of a meaningless beauty pageant. its a title that doesnt actually speak to the underlying business particularly if those volumes are being driven by low margin low cost phones. bmo capital markets analyst tim long just released a research note estimating that apple grabbed 00NUMBER00 of the smartphone industrys operating profits in the third quarter meaning that everyone else collectively lost money on their phones. if apple can grab over 00NUMBER00 of the industrys profits with just 00NUMBER00 unit share then i think itll be just fine even if huawei one day overtakes apple in unit volumes. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show

views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  apple aapl may not sell the most phones out there but its dominance in one specific area is what matters most to investors and this isnt likely to go away anytime soon. in a recent research note bmo capital markets analysts led by tim long noted that for the first time apple owned 00NUMBER00 of the profit in the smartphone market for the third quarter the first time ever it had owned all of the profit and then some. apple was the big winner in the quarter with over 00NUMBER00 of smartphone industry profits long wrote in a note to clients. this is important as the smartphone market is now mature with shipments down 00NUMBER00 year over year in the quarter to 00NUMBER00 million but up 00NUMBER00 sequentially longs research highlighted. this is a great sign for apple going forward as the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus were not supposed to be a huge positive for apple. a lot of people were going to wait until next year to upgrade their iphones or so the prevailing thought went. as usual the consensus on apple has been wrong and apple has proven that it knows what its doing when it comes to upgrades. given the excitement surrounding next years models it will be interesting to see how many people do upgrade next year as opposed to this year. were not likely to see the explosive unit growth we saw just a few years ago so companies like apple samsung and now google are going to battle it out for profits. thats where apple has dominated and that fact is likely to change anytime soon. apple is highly unlikely to see the most the most of anything though it is the currently the leader in the tablet market but its able to have such a high share of the profits in the smartphone market for a few different reasons. not only is its key competitor samsung experiencing huge problems with the recall of its galaxy note 00NUMBER00 but unlike its competition apple makes both the hardware and software for its devices. while google is also doing that with the pixel phone and early reviews have been positive its going to be a long time before google approaches apple like levels in terms of unit sales. as apple continues to build out its ecosystem including apple music icloud and other services designed for the iphone this strength is likely to continue to be one of the major areas the company can point towards as a positive. shares have had a nice run over the past six months and that momentum is likely to continue as we get to the holiday season and beyond. not bad for a device that was largely glossed over when it was first announced. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not

another color option for potential iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus buyers jet white. presumably this would be a white phone with the same glossy finish as the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models along with a white face similar to those found on the silver gold and rose gold models. image source apple. mac otakara doesnt seem thatconfident in this report though as it cautioned that this information may be unreliable. lets take a closer look at whether or not this rumor makes sense. there is a reason that smartphone makers care about building attractive looking devices people are likely much more willing whether theyre aware of it or not to buy a device that looks sleek and appealing than they are to buy a device that looks ho hum. given how popular the iphone models in jet black seem to be kgi securities ming chi kuo saidthat 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of iphone pre orders worldwide and almost 00NUMBER00 of iphone pre orders in china were for jet black models its clear that customers are attracted to that finish. if customers like the jet black finish then its reasonable to assume that there might be customers who would like glossy iphone models in other colors like white. such a device could certainly be attractive to customers who would have otherwise gone with say an iphone in silver. per kuo manufacturing yields on the glossy finish used on the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models in jet black initially werent great coming in between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. that relatively low yield rate may have been one reason apple didnt apply the glossy finish to additional iphone models. however as apple and its manufacturing partners have gotten better at building phones with this finish yield rates have likely improved. if manufacturing yields have improved on apples process to produce the glossy finish and since demand for iphone models in jet black appears to be strong then a mid cycle jet white iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus release would make sense. here are a few reasons why. first apple is likely to limit the jet white finish to more expensive 00NUMBER00 gigabyte and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte configurations just as it does with the jet black models in order to encourage up selling. for example a potential customer who might have otherwise gone with a 00NUMBER00 gigabyte iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in silver might instead opt to go with an iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in a 00NUMBER00 gigabyte configuration in order to get the new jet white finish. this could help to further bolster apples iphone average selling prices and thus revenue and profits. second an attractive new finish may simply help to boost demand. there might be users of older generation iphone models who are on the fence about upgrading to new models. an attractive jet white model could be what pushes some of those customers over the edge. the potential impact from a mid cycle jet white iphone release likely wouldnt be a game changer for apple but it could be a low riskhigh reward way for the company to try to both juice iphone average selling prices and boost demand for iphones during the current fiscal year. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

00NUMBER00 grade internals at a low price point and in the familiar compact iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 form factor. image source apple. though apples flagship iphone models usually see annual refreshes kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo by way of 00NUMBER00 says apple doesnt plan to introduce a successor to the iphone se during the first half of fiscal year 00NUMBER00. lets take a closer look at what kuo says this might mean for apples iphone business. kuo notes that during the second quarter of 00NUMBER00 the third quarter of apples fiscal year 00NUMBER00 the idevice maker saw higher than expected iphone unit shipments thanks to upbeat demand for the iphone se. kuo argues that the lack of a refreshed iphone se in the same period this year the second and third quarters of calendar and fiscal year 00NUMBER00 respectively will lead to a drop in apples iphone shipments from 00NUMBER00 million units last year to somewhere between 00NUMBER00 million and 00NUMBER00 million units this year. although its true that apple did see a boost during the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 from the iphone se as ceo tim cook mentioned that demand for the iphone se outstripped supply throughout the quarter there was another dynamic happening in parallel to the iphone se ramp up an iphone channel inventory reduction. during the fiscal third quarter of 00NUMBER00 apple said it reduced iphone channel inventory levels by over 00NUMBER00 million units. that means that because apple overshipped iphone units relative to demand in prior quarters the company needed to undership end demand during the quarter to bring down iphone channel inventory levels. also keep in mind that this overall iphone channel inventory reduction came as apple was probably trying to increase channel inventories of the iphone se. cook said the company was able to achieve supplydemand balance on this product entering the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 00NUMBER00. this all suggests that apple reduced channel inventory levels of its non iphone se iphone models by even more than 00NUMBER00 million units in that quarter. kuos estimate that apple will ship 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million iphone units during the third quarter of its fiscal year 00NUMBER00 seems pessimistic. if we assume that apple wont have to drain channel inventory levels this time around a reasonable assumption since apple is probably managing channel inventories much more cautiously now then shipments of 00NUMBER00 million to 00NUMBER00 million iphone units would imply a pretty dramatic year over year drop in demand. to illustrate note that without the 00NUMBER00 million unit channel inventory reduction in the third quarter of fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple would have shipped more along the lines of 00NUMBER00 million iphone units in the third quarter of fiscal year 00NUMBER00. taking the midpoint of kuos estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 00NUMBER00 the analyst is seemingly calling for underlying iphone unit demand to be down 00NUMBER00 year over year. though a decline of this magnitude is possible there are a number of factors working in apples favor this time aroundin fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple was dogged by tough year over year comparisons from the iphone 00NUMBER00 super cycle. in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple has a much easier baseline to compare against. apples product lineup for the entirety of fiscal year 00NUMBER00 the iphone se iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus and iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus is arguably more competitive than its product lineup was in the prior fiscal year. kuos predictions may ultimately come to pass but all we know now is that apple is supply constrained on iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and management isnt quite sureif it will reach supplydemand balance on the latter by the end of the current quarter. so without more supporting data id think twice before making investment decisions based on those predictions. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a

pros might give apples mac business the shot in the arm it needs. according to a report in digitimes apple is placing aggressive orders for components for its new macbook pros which it announced last month. apple badly needs a turnaround in its computing business which had sales of 00NUMBER00 million macs in the most recent quarter up 00NUMBER00 sequentially but down 00NUMBER00 year over year. the touchid and touch bar features are proof that apple can continue to innovate but it doesnt need to go full touchscreen for computers because its a bad experience. the digitimes report jives with the wait times seen on apples website. the new 00NUMBER00 inch macbook pro with touchid and touch bar has a ship date between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 weeks and the same goes for the 00NUMBER00 inch model. conversely the other macbook pro that was announced in late october which doesnt have touchid and a touch bar is available to ship immediately. theres been a lot of criticism for the new macbook pros mostly because of the need for dongles to connect an iphone to the new computer. a lot of the criticism has come from the creative community artists writers and the like but so far thats not impacting sales. even though apple has its fair share of critics it actually did respond cutting the price of certain dongles to help ease the transition as the next wave of computing comes along. the reviews for the new macbook pros have been largely positive a good sign that even if theres been a chorus of complaints it shouldnt affect sales. people dont buy computers for this year or next they buy them so that they will still be useful in three to five years. ultimately laptops are moving towards doing away with usb a ports the source of much of the frustration so apple is moving towards the future even if some of its users have complained about it. the mac isnt going anywhere anytime soon despite apples hope that the ipad pro replaces computers especially pcs. even though apple itself has said that the ipad pro is more powerful than 00NUMBER00 of the laptops out there but theres still a significant need for the mac. apple has also explicitly said it wont be merging macos and ios anytime soon either so its a good bet that apples computing line is likely to live on for some time. growth in the mac over the next few quarters can help keep the companys overall revenue growing which is important since its largely reliant on one product the iphone. the iphone accounts for nearly two thirds of apples revenue so any help it can get from the mac is a bonus. apple knows this is where macs and computers as a whole are going in the future. as more people get used to dealing with the changes itll become second nature and apples mac business should benefit in the long run. even if it takes a few hiccups to get there. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. for years applenasdaq aapl has tried to make inroads within the worlds second most populous country. the iphone maker has struggled to make much progress due to a wide range of structural challenges associated with expanding its presence. four years ago a policy change at indias department of industrial policy and promotion dipp revised its rules on foreign companies owning single brand retail stores which theoretically opened up a path for apple to set up its own retail stores. the main catch was a requirement that any such store must source at least 00NUMBER00 of the value of its products from within india an effort to bolster the local economy. apple has been working with indian officials ever since continuing to evaluate how to set up shop because apple is unable to meet that sourcing requirement. earlier this year finance minister arun jaitley rejectedapples request for leeway on the requirement. apple had been seeking an exception based on the fact that its products are state of the art and cutting edge which make them eligible for an exception. the economic times is reporting that apple is now asking for various incentives from the government as it is considering ways to expand manufacturing within the country. the government has been trying to woo international companies to bring electronics manufacturing to india and apple hopes to score some of the incentives being offered. there are several government agencies involved but the dipp will soon issue an opinion that may influence other agencies. foxconn apples primary contract manufacturer has been discussing plans to open up a manufacturing facility in india and certainly apple scoring some incentives would help offset some of these costs since the facility is reportedly going to be exclusively making apple products. having devices manufactured in india would help reduce the import tariffs that drive up the costs of iphones and other imported products. its worth noting that even if apple is able to successfully get incentives to expand manufacturing there are still other challenges that it faces. the incentive wouldnt directly affect apples ability to set up its own retail stores which would theoretically go a long way with improving distribution and owning the customer purchasing experience. iphones are still prohibitively expensive to the vast majority of average indian consumers which is why apple has just a 00NUMBER00 market share according to strategy analytics. ceo tim cook has been talking about apples opportunities in india for years so it doesnt inspire much confidence that the company has made such little progress over this amount of time. of course its extremely hard to compete when local rules and regulations have stacked the deck against you but its also probably true that india isnt at the top of apples priority list right about now. that being said cook did add some color around india on the last quarterly conference call noting that iphone sales in fiscal 00NUMBER00 were up 00NUMBER00 in india. theres also been a lack of network infrastructureon india i think its important to look not only at per capita income which may be what youre looking at but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. and the age of the population if you look at india almost 00NUMBER00 of the population is under 00NUMBER00. and so you have a very very young population. the smartphone has not done as well in india in general. however one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasnt been there. but this year or this year and next year there are enormous investments going in on 00NUMBER00 and we couldnt be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iphone to produce that great experience for people. the reality is that apple probably does have plenty of time considering the demographics of india as well as the socioeconomic landscape. if the population is still young and the middle class hasnt hit critical mass yet apple may be able to bide its time as it tries to line up all the other pieces of its strategy. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company

spring of 00NUMBER00. mac otakara listed some features expected to be included in the upcoming tablets such as true tone wide color displays and 00NUMBER00 megapixel isight cameras. image source apple. separately according to bloomberg the next generation ipad models will also include support for a faster display technology. its clear that all the secrets of apples next generation ipad models have yet to be revealed. today id like to go over one feature id like to see on apples next generation tablets. with the iphone 00NUMBER00 series of smartphones launched in late 00NUMBER00 apple introduced a technology known as 00NUMBER00 touch. in apples own words 00NUMBER00 touch senses how deeply users press the display letting them do more than ever with developers apps and games. the company touted it as a pretty big deal making its omission from the current ipad lineup a bit awkward. back in late 00NUMBER00 appleinsider  said  citing a source familiar with the matter that apple apparently found that it couldnt take the 00NUMBER00 touch technology used in the iphone 00NUMBER00 series devices and bring it to larger format displays. appleinsiders source also claimed that apple at the time was working on a comparable technology for integration in both iphones and ipads. apple has had a while to work on building 00NUMBER00 touch technology aimed at ipad sized devices so itd be be nice to see the companys 00NUMBER00 ipad lineup offer 00NUMBER00 touch capability. theres little doubt that 00NUMBER00 touch will add bill of materials cost if its included in a future ipad thats on top of the technical hurdles the idevice maker apparently must grapple with to even get 00NUMBER00 touch added to larger screen devices. however i think its important that apple bring this technology to the ipad as quickly as possible. remember that virtually every new iphone sold today aside from the low cost iphone se includes 00NUMBER00 touch support. the installed base of 00NUMBER00 touch capable ios devices is now very large and growing and it wont be long before the bulk of ios device owners come to expect that 00NUMBER00 touch is simply part of the ios platform and not just the iphone. indeed apple made significant changes to 00NUMBER00 its latest version of ios to make 00NUMBER00 touch a more integral part of the ios experience. its going to be tough to explain to customers why the expensive new ipad that apple is trying to sell doesnt include a feature that theyve become accustomed to having on the device. additionally with such a large portion of the ios device installed base now using 00NUMBER00 touch enabled devices developers are likely to increasingly find value in integrating 00NUMBER00 touch into their applications. it would be a shame if developers couldnt bring those same 00NUMBER00 touch features to the ipad focused versions of their applications. finally 00NUMBER00 touch on the ipad would simply be a nice innovative selling point. it wouldnt be enough to carry the next generation ipad models to sales success but combined with other interesting features the new devices could bring enough to the table to get owners of older ipad models to finally upgrade. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity  the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres

and force touch track pads to the prior generation models. late last month apple released new macbook pro models that represented much larger leaps forward than what last years models did. image source apple. the changes that apple brought to this years models were sweeping. among them were sleeker form factors much better displays speedier processors a new touch bar with touch id support in place of the function keys new keyboards and improved force touch track pads. the investment community might be wondering why it took apple so long to get these redesigned macbook pro systems out. per a new report from digitimes we now have the answer. digitimes citing sources from the upstream supply chain says that apple is said to have delayed the products shipment schedule by a quarter due to low yield rates for some components. the components facing these yield challenges the report says included batteries keyboards and hinges. component manufacturing yield issues can lead to both supply issues not enough good product gets made as well as cost structure problems defective products have a non zero cost to manufacture but ultimately generate no revenue raising the average cost for the ones that ultimately are salable. its little wonder that apple decided to hold off on bringing these new systems to market until yields on these critical components improved. although the digitimes report offered an explanation for the delay in bringing these new macbook pro computers to market the article was primarily focused on apples component order patterns for the systems. this is interesting stuff so lets take a closer look at what it had to say. per digitimes sources apple is optimistic about the sales of these new macbook pro computers. that optimism digitimes reports has led to apple turning aggressive with respect to component orders after the launch in october. furthermore those same sources reportedly told digitimes that macbook pro shipments in 00NUMBER00 are also expected to stay at the same level as in 00NUMBER00. according to market research company idc the personal computer market is expected to decline by 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. during the first three quarters of the year apples personal computer unit declines have been wider than those that the overall personal computer market have suffered this means that apple has been losing market share. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 mac unit shipment 00NUMBER00 market unit shipment 00NUMBER00 sources apple idc. should the personal computer market decline again in 00NUMBER00 apple simply shipping the same number of macbook pro computers in 00NUMBER00 as it does in 00NUMBER00 would imply a return to market share gains. apple returning to year over year unit share gains in the personal computer market would be a positive but the real story here could be the potential for growth in revenue share. remember apples new macbook pro products are priced at premiums to what the prior generation models were priced at. furthermore apple is keeping some of its prior generation models around at the same price points that they were at before the new macbook pro systems launched. if apple is able to keep its macbook pro unit shipments flat in 00NUMBER00 relative to what they were during 00NUMBER00 it is likely that its average selling prices on those systems will be significantly higher. this could lead to apples mac related revenue growth and thus revenue share growth being much more robust than its unit and unit share growth will be. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity

according to kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo by way of macrumors applenasdaq aapl isnt planning to release an updated version of the iphone se during the first half of its fiscal year 00NUMBER00. the success of the iphone se line though practically guarantees that the company will release an improved version of the phone at some point. image source apple. lets go over three features that i expect to be present in a future iteration of the iphone se. every iphone model apple sells today aside from the iphone se comes equipped with 00NUMBER00 touch. the se didnt get the technology probably because apple wanted to give customers a reason to buy more expensive phones and because 00NUMBER00 touch probably adds significant cost. but by the time apple gets ready to mass produce and sell an updated iphone se 00NUMBER00 touch will no longer be a major point of differentiation within the iphone product stack. instead it will probably be a must have feature for any new ios device sold. manufacturing costs for the technology will also probably come down as manufacturing yields improve. when apple refreshes the iphone se the inclusion of 00NUMBER00 touch is a must. for a while now apple has been transitioning to displays that can render a wider color gamut. apples imac and macbook pro computers 00NUMBER00 inch ipad pro and iphone 00NUMBER00 series smartphones all include displays capable of rendering the dci 00NUMBER00 color space which apple says is 00NUMBER00 larger than the traditional srgb color space that apples devices have previously been limited to. the next iphone se should include a wide color display. if it does its also likely to include many of the other display quality enhancements that apple introduced with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 series devices including improved viewing angles greater contrast ratio and more. a new display would also probably dramatically improve the delivered user experience relative to the current iphone se model potentially helping to spur demand. one of the nice things about the iphone 00NUMBER00 is that it not only includes a wide color display but it also has cameras capable of capturing images in wide color. should the next iphone include a new wide color display apple should also update the isight and front facing cameras to be able to capture images in wide color. doing so would be easy for apple which could recycle the sensors inside the front facing and rear facing camera from the iphone 00NUMBER00 in the future iphone se. apple may be able to include optical image stabilization though its not clear if apple would need to make modifications to the iphone ses shell to accommodate that technology. if kuo is correct that an updated iphone se wont arrive anytime soon it might make sense for apple to simply hold off until march 00NUMBER00 to release such a product. the current iphone se is still a credible smartphone that offers strong performance and features for the price and its likely to remain so over the next year. looking at it from another angle right now there seems to be a popular view that fiscal year 00NUMBER00 is something of a transition year for apple ahead of whats expected to be an iphone 00NUMBER00 super cycle in fiscal year 00NUMBER00. by saving an updated iphone se for fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple could be better positioning itself for nice year over year iphone revenue and unit growth comparisons. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool

time to start thinking about last minute moves to get some juicy tax savings. hey with the presidential election there could be important changes to the tax code coming. so maybe we should make moves now just in casedefinitely. besides when it comes to getting tax savings it is important to plan and be proactive. missing a deadline can certainly be bad news. of course the readers at investorplacecomwant to get tips about how to deal with capital gains and especially losses. but there are other areas that can make a big impact such as putting more dollars into your retirement account or setting aside money for charities. but as should be no surprise the rules can get a bit tricky. 00NUMBER00 shiny new dividend stocks you can trust in the long runso lets take a look at three tax moves you can make before 00NUMBER00 comes to a closecharitable deductions really highlight that you can do well by doing good â€¦ but there are some things to keep in mind. first of all you must itemize your deductions. you also need to make a donation to an irs approved nonprofit organization so make sure to ask or go to the correct section of the irs website. and just in case you get audited make sure you keep records of your donations such as with a canceled check bank statement or credit card statement. note that if the credit card charge is made on or before dec. 00NUMBER00 the donation will count for your 00NUMBER00 taxes. you can also make donations with property such as with stocks mutual funds bonds or real estate. in fact these can result in major tax benefits although a key is to donate property that you have held over one year. whyto see lets take an example say that a few months ago you bought shares of apple inc. nasdaqaapl for 00NUMBER00 and then donated them to a charity. in this case your deduction would come to 00NUMBER00. but suppose you waited for more than a year in this situation you would be able to deduct the market value of the shares. so if your apple position went up by 00NUMBER00 then your deduction would be 00NUMBER00. but with a stock donation you should start the process a couple weeks before the end of the year. keep in mind that it can take some time for your financial firm to make the transfer. also what if you have stock that has lost value in this case it generally is better to sell it and then give the cash to the charity because that way you can take advantage of the tax loss. your 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 is really something you should not pass on. if anything your employer may even match contributions which is essentially a nice bonus. but the tax benefits are certainly attractive. first of all the gains are not taxed until you take money out of your retirement account the idea is that by that time you will be in a lower tax bracket. next your contributions are made pre tax. for example if you have an effective tax rate of 00NUMBER00 say for federal state and local then an annual contribution of 00NUMBER00 will mean not having to pay 00NUMBER00 in taxes. 00NUMBER00 growth stocks that should replace apple in your portfolioif you do not have access to a 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00 you can still set up an ira. in terms of your tax deduction it is limited to 00NUMBER00 there is an additional 00NUMBER00 if you are 00NUMBER00 or older. yet this is still a good deal. you also have until april 00NUMBER00 of next year to get the benefits for your 00NUMBER00 taxes. have you sold stock for gains this year or perhaps you could get a capital gain distribution from your mutual fund which comes in decemberif so you may want to offset some or all of this by selling your losers. this is known as tax loss harvesting. granted if you make a lot of trades in your accounts this process can get a bit tedious but it is still worth doing. yet this does not mean your decisions should be solely focused on taxes. hey perhaps you have a biotech stock and there may be an fda decision soon. in other words it probably does not make sense to unload it right now since you could miss out on a big gain. something else even if you do not have gains this year you can still benefit from tax loss harvesting. this is because you can deduct up to 00NUMBER00 in capital losses per year against your ordinary income any additional losses can be carried forward to future years. and finally if you are in the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 tax brackets some or all of your long term capital gains may be tax freeso to get an estimate on the tax impact of a stock sale you can check out the following online

either the mac or the ipad. meanwhile apples guidance left a little to be desired. in this clip fromindustry focus tech motley fool analysts dylan lewis and evan niu cfa break down the results from the latest earnings release. a full transcript follows the video. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street analysts and the fool didnt miss a beat theres a small company thats powering their brand new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. and we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in the know investors to be one of them just click here. this podcast was recorded on oct. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisone of the things i thought was particularly interesting with the commentary from this report was you look at the services segment you look at the last couple quarters youve seen service segment revenue up 00NUMBER00 and theyre really touting this number. most recently it was 00NUMBER00 billion which is roughly 00NUMBER00 of revenue. at this point were coming up on two full years of them breaking out services as a product segment. looking backwards weve seen a huge step change in the fiscal 00NUMBER00 quarter. in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 we were at 00NUMBER00 billion. that hopped up a full billion dollars in the following quarter fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. so im really curious looking forward what that segment might look like. theoretically we should be in the step change quarter. itll be interesting to see if they can sustain that growth or if were going to continue to see them hum along at more or less flat sequential growth. evan niu yeah services is becoming huge. like you said its 00NUMBER00 billion. and if you look at the past four quarters this is now basically a 00NUMBER00 billion business. thats bigger than the mac bigger than the ipad. its their second biggest business at this point which is kind of crazy to think about because apple is typically not that great at services in general. particularly because the services revenue most of it is not coming from a subscription service like apple music that bills every month. thats certainly part of it. but it comes back to what we were talking about earlier which is the whole installed base related purchases. a lot of that services revenue comes from them relying on their users buying content and apps on the app store reliably. thats why that number is important and im surprised they didnt give it. not a whole lot of it is occurring monthly subscription fees that you can count on every month. so it is important but theyre doing a really good job of growing that number. its a pretty big business now 00NUMBER00 billion. lewis its huge. i think you hit on the installed base thing if there are any issues with them growing that installed base it stands to reason that the services segment wont continue to grow the way that it has. thats kind of the relationship there and thats why you always see the step change happen in fiscal 00NUMBER00 because thats when they sell a ton of iphones. youre going to see those two things move together. thats certainly something that im watching in the coming quarter because theyre pointing to it more and more in their conference calls. i think its an indication of a lot of other elements of their business. niu absolutely. lewis looking forward and looking at the guidance that they provided for the first time since physical 00NUMBER00 of last year apple is guiding for year over year growth next quarter which i think is a welcome sign for a lot of investors. the company is expecting revenue to come in somewhere between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. when we say year over year growth fiscal 00NUMBER00 last year they posted revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. so its not going to be huge but it is positive growth. niu ill take it. lewis yeah at this point looking year over year declines for a little while its certainly a welcome trend to see. i think some people are maybe a little disappointed in this guidance given some of the tailwinds that the business has right now at its disposal. this is something weve talked about in previous shows. one of the major competitors the samsung note 00NUMBER00 being off the market you would think would be a much larger catalyst for apple than maybe theyre letting on. niu yeah. they declined to give any meaningful comment on whether or not they think theyll benefit but i think pretty clearly that they will. and now theres even reports that the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge is catching on fire. i dont know if youve seen it theres not as many of them. but there were reports starting in september. that was a month ago. again its not as widespread but there are a handful of cases across the world like in china and the philippines with the 00NUMBER00 edge which is one of the phones that samsung is pushing people toward. and heres the crazy part  one of those phone was a replacement for a galaxy note 00NUMBER00. so samsung gives a customer an 00NUMBER00 edge to replace his note 00NUMBER00 that caught on fire and the 00NUMBER00 edge catches on fire its just a mess. lewis thats a bad brand experience there. niu i think going back to their guidance i do think the one thing that stood out to me as far as not so great in the guidance was the gross margin guide. the revenue guidance was fine because itll be nice to get a little growth even if its not a lot. we had three consecutive quarters of negative growth up top at this point so i think anything is nice. on the profitability side i was surprised too because in the fourth quarter apple always enjoys a lot of operating leverage when their revenue scales up to these really high levels. usually you see margins expanding in a pretty meaningful way usually to the point where youre at 00NUMBER00. theyre guiding to basically upwards of 00NUMBER00. so 00NUMBER00 basis points shy of what i would expect them to guide to. and for what its worth last year they did 00NUMBER00. lewis in fairness on that 00NUMBER00 figure that was also a quarter where they realized 00NUMBER00 million or so in a patent dispute agreement with samsung. i think that added about 00NUMBER00 basis points to that margin number. i think the true margin number was like 00NUMBER00 or so. niu but if you go back another year it was still like 00NUMBER00. its still pretty close to 00NUMBER00. and i know it doesnt sound like a lot 00NUMBER00 basis points but when youre talking about a business this big every basis point counts. one basis point is like 00NUMBER00 million. so multiply that by 00NUMBER00 and thats gross profit coming straight down through the income statement. theyve been talking a lot about commodity costs and component costs being very favorable. so im wondering why that guidance wasnt stronger. its also possible that there are some currency effects because theyve been battling the strengthening dollar for a really long time. thats very much hurting them because about two thirds of revenue comes from outside the u. s. the strengthening dollar has been hurting them for many quarters. so that could also be part of it. i think that might have been why the original market reaction was negative. if youre watching after hours the stock jumped on the iphone number as soon as it was released started getting back those gains as people read through the numbers and started digesting them a little bit. dylan lewisowns shares of apple. evan niu cfaowns

are going to reveal themselves there observers can get a sense of what types of projects and technologies the company is investing more into. image source apple. this in turn can provide some insight into what the future of apples products might hold at least in broad terms. so lets go over three key insights that can be gleaned from the companys current set of job listings. on nov. 00NUMBER00 alone apple posted 00NUMBER00 job listingsrelated to hardware engineering. of those 00NUMBER00 at least nine arguably 00NUMBER00 were related to the companys chip development efforts. apple airpods. image source apple. its likely that most of this hiring is aimed to bulk up its a series smartphone and tablet processors after all apples leadership in these technologies certainly serves to build a long term user experience competitive advantage relative to its competition. however apple has also been investing in wireless system on a chip technology. this development might point to apples working to build in house cellular modem efforts but theres another potential explanation. at the iphone 00NUMBER00 series launch apple launched a family of wireless earbuds known as airpods. the airpods according to the company includes an apple designed wireless chip known as the 00NUMBER00 which apples chief design officer jony ive says via 00NUMBER00 enables intelligent connection to all your apple devices and allows you to instantly switch between whichever one youre using. apples wireless chip efforts could very well be in service of future w series connectivity chips and perhaps other technologies that havent quite been made public yet. apple has put up a job listingfor a display manufacturing supplier quality engineering manager. the individual who ultimately gets this position will have direct impact on the quality of the next generations of iphone and apple watch. under the key qualifications apple says that it would prefer to hire a candidate with oled process experience andor flexible display module process experience. so if there were any doubts that curved oled displays were coming soon to apples iphone product lineup this should squash them. on nov. 00NUMBER00 apple posted a job listing for a 00NUMBER00 perception algorithm engineer. according to the listing the individual who gets this gig will implement 00NUMBER00 computer vision algorithms using existing hardware blocks gpu dedicated soc with an emphasis on performance and power. whats more the listing goes on to say that this engineer will evaluate existing hardware blocks and contribute to the definition of new hardware blocks. in other words this listing suggests that apple is working on getting these 00NUMBER00 computer vision algorithms to work reasonably on current generation a series processors. then once apple figures out efficient algorithms to perform the desired 00NUMBER00 perception and computer vision functionality it will build specialized hardware that can run those algorithms and pretty much only those algorithms extremely quickly and in a very power efficient manner which is important for battery life purposes. this is an example of the ability to integrate hardware and software that apple often brags about. itll be interesting to see how these technologies work when they are ultimately introduced into future iphone and ipad products.

source apple. this happens every couple of years its just a lot louder this time around. in the wake of applesnasdaq aapl  release of new macbook pros which were unveiled last month there has been considerable user backlash surrounding the companys decision to completely transition all inputoutput jacks to usb c apples implementation also supports thunderbolt 00NUMBER00. the criticisms arent misplaced as creative professionals looking to upgrade to the newest models will undoubtedly be inconvenienced by the sheer number of dongles and adaptors that theyll need for their daily workflow. the irony is that usb cs potential as a universal port is precisely why the controversy is magnified this time. apple isnt just swapping out one old port for one new port its swapping out a handful of old ports for one new port. apples fastest growing product category. pic. 00NUMBER00 at the same time the decision was hardly unexpected as there had been months of rumors that apple would switch completely to usb c as the port of the future. its useful at times like these to go back and revisit how apple approaches which technologies to invest in. steve jobs made his final appearance at allthingds 00NUMBER00 conference in 00NUMBER00 and discussed the ipad and the controversial absence of adobeflash on the tablet. people were outraged that apples new device didnt support the standard web video technology of the time. his response to walt mossberg really hit at apples broader philosophywalt mossbergwhat if people say the ipad is crippled in this respectsteve jobswell you know id say two things. number one things are packages of emphasis. some things are emphasized in a product some things are not done as well some things are chosen not to be done at all in a product. and so different people make different choices and if the market tells us were making the wrong choices then we listen to the market. were just people running this company. were trying to make greatproducts for people. and so we have at least the courage of our convictions to say we dont think this is part of what makes a great product and were gonna leave it out. some people are gonna not like that theyre gonna call us names its not going to be in certain companys vested interests that we do that but were gonna take the heat because we want to make the bestproduct in the world for customers. were going to instead focus our energy on these technologies which we think are in their ascendancy and we think are gonna be the right technologies for customers. and you know what theyre paying us to make those choices. thats what a lot of customers pay us to do. is to try and make the best products we can. and if we succeed theyll buythem. and if we dont they wont. and itll all work itself out. so far id have to say people seem to be liking ipads. weve sold one every three seconds since we launched it. it should be clear that usb c is a technology that is in its ascendancy even if apples switch is seemingly premature given the immaturity of the usb c ecosystem. theres another quote thats a little more directly relevant here too. this controversy actually started last year when apple launched the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook which also only uses usb c. the main difference is that the move is less likely to attract ire in a consumer laptop while professionals have greater connectivity needs with their tools and workflow. when asked about the decision in a mashableinterview marketing chief phil schiller acknowledged that these types of transitions are often tough and uncomfortable we found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond whats expected beyond whats comfortable sometimes. from an investing perspective the real question is whether or not this controversy will prove to be a fading argument like all past instances or if there will be some type of lasting impact on apples mac business. assuming that the industry indeed moves toward usb c which by all signs it is slowly but surely its pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where this hurts apple over the long haul. one encouraging data point is that schiller also confirmed in a recent interview withthe independent that demand is soaring and we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new macbook pro than any other pro notebook before. so there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. so far id have to say people seem to be liking macbook pros. itll all work itself out. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when

are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  applenasdaq aapl ceo tim cook indicated on the companys oct. 00NUMBER00 earnings call that it expects to reach supply demand balance on the iphone 00NUMBER00 by the end of the current quarter. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus on the other hand is a different story. image source apple. cook explained that hes not confident in calling for apple to reach supply demand balance on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus by the end of the quarter as demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus versus apples forecast going into the product launch. cook referred to iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in general but investors should note that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus comes in five finishes gold rose gold silver black and jet black. by far the most difficult to buy has been the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in jet black with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in black coming in a close second. the bad news is that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in jet black is still very hard to purchase even though it launched more than a month ago. the good news though is that supply of these phones appears to be improving. for some time after the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch website istocknow showed that it was virtually impossible to find a jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in stock at apple stores across the united states. the situation is still pretty bleak for those looking to buy the device in store but it has gotten better. there are at least some apple stores within the united states that have the devices in stockred means that the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus isnt available for in store pickup green means that it is. image sourceistocknow. for those looking to order from apples online store rather than making an in store reservation ship times have come down from approximately six to eight weeks to a more modest three to five weeks. image source apple. to be clear thats still a pretty long time to wait which indicates that the supply demand imbalance for these models is still severe but progress is progress. its a positive thing for any company when theres robust demand for its products. the better than expected demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus is a positive for the idevice maker as these phones carry higher average selling prices than their smaller counterparts. another potential positive for iphone average selling prices is that demand for the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 plus appears to be better than it is for the iphone models in other finishes. at the very least we can say that the supply demand imbalance for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in jet black is more severe than it is for any other iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models. strong demand for high priced iphone models is good but apple needs to work quickly to make sure it satisfies that demand while it still exists. if it can thatll be good for apples financial results for the current quarter and potentially its share price. if apple exits the quarter still in supply demand imbalance for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and in particular the jet black version then that will push some sales out into the next quarter. revenue push outs wouldnt necessarily be a negative for apple. as long as apple gets that revenue within the fiscal year its all good. however the potential for frustrated possible iphone 00NUMBER00 plus buyers to simply give up on waiting and purchase alternative non apple devices is something the idevice maker should aim to mitigate with improved supply. 00NUMBER00 stocks we

 two important themes that emerged from applesnasdaq aapl  most recent earnings release were rising rd costs alongside falling sales in greater china. in this clip fromindustry focus tech motley fool

dylan lewisthis came up in the conference call from a couple different folks. ive seen some people worried about whats going on with the rd spend research and development side of apples expenses and whats going on in china for them. do you want to hit on that a little bitevan niu i think there are some questions about why is rd expenditure growth growing at this accelerated pace apple is really good at efficiently spending on rd. a few years ago it used to always be 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of revenue range which is tiny. a lot of other tech companies are like 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. google and microsoft thats how much they spend of their revenue on rd. its not as if the more you spend the more innovative. its not linear. it can be wasteful sometimes if youre spending on projects that you never actually commercialize which i think microsoft has a tendency to do. apple has always been really good at only really putting this money into things they know they can commercialize later on. but now in the past few quarters were seeing this number rise to this 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of sales at the same time that revenue is slowing down so theres a lot of questions of whats going on here the obvious answer is theyre spending money on these things for the pipeline that they wont talk about. lewis which is maddening as an investor. theyre like dont worry were spending it well were allocating resources great just trust us. niu just trust us. yeah. there was this talk of a car and clearly a car is incredibly expensive to develop. who knows if they actually do it theres all these conflicting reports on where apple is or is not heading with this car idea. but that is certainly as far as expenses go extremely expensive on the rd front. theres things like augmented reality virtual reality ai. there are a lot of things apple is certainly exploring here but they cant talk about. so theres a real question i think at this point. yeah we know theyre spending this money and we can probably guess on what based not only on where apple specific rumors are coming from but also where the tech industry is going. we know everyone is working on these things. so the real question will be can they do these things and when they do launch them will they be compelling will they be better than everyone elses will they actually drive the business even more and you just have to wait. lewis yeah unfortunately its a wait and see type of thing for investors. im not freaking out about it yet but i think its a good thing to monitor. niu definitely. lewis what about whats going on in chinaniu china there was this big thing sales were down 00NUMBER00. last quarter they were down 00NUMBER00. the quarter before that they were down 00NUMBER00. if you just look at these year over year numbers it looks really bad. but you have to realize theyre just facing tough comps because they did so well in 00NUMBER00. if you zoom out a little bit and look at their business on an annual basis this is still a 00NUMBER00 billion business in china. last year it was a 00NUMBER00 plus billion business. and the year before it was like 00NUMBER00 something billion. this is still very much headed in the right direction. i used to track their greater china sales before they actually broke it out and exposed it in this lush detail. if you go back to fiscal 00NUMBER00 i think they did less than 00NUMBER00 billion in sales that year. youd have to basically stitch these numbers together from conference call comments which i used to do. now they give it to you directly. but i used to dig these numbers up. i think it was 00NUMBER00 million in fiscal 00NUMBER00. that was seven years ago. now theyre basically 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. you cant argue with the long term trajectory of it. and theres still a lot of room to grow this is nowhere near the end game. china is still nowhere near saturated theres still tons of first time smartphone buyers. the middle class is still booming. theres just a couple of tough comparisons because they did so well last year. i wouldnt worry too much. its just this noisy quarterly trends quarter to quarter its tough to call. and yeah theres certainly some competition coming in from these lower end android makers like xiaomi and all these other local players. at the same time i dont think theres a lot to worry about. theres still a lot of room to grow in terms of physical geographic footprint. they dont have that many stores still they only have about 00NUMBER00 stores or so. i dont think theres anything to worry about even if these past few quarters look scary on paper. lewis yeah if you choose to look at their numbers on a two year comp instead of a year over year comp they look pretty darn impressive rightniu right. lewis so thats something to keep in mind. dylan lewisowns shares of apple. evan niu cfaowns shares of apple. the motley fool owns shares of and

the motley fool has a disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  analyst steve milunovich by way ofbarrons recently argued that applesnasdaq aapl rumored use of oled displays in next generation iphone models creates an opportunity for a substantial form factor change that could be the catalyst to accelerating iphone growth. image source apple. however the analyst speculates that margins might decline if build cost increases outstrip higher prices. he adds that apple could end up selling plus phones at closer to regular size prices. although its true that apples gross profit margins would obviously decline in the case that manufacturing costs go up by more than average selling prices do generation over generation and thats a given i doubt that apples rumored adoption of oled based displays next year will drive that. heres why. the current rumor which comes from generally reliable japanese publication nikkei is that apple is planning three iphone models next year ones with 00NUMBER00 inch 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch displays. only the variant with a 00NUMBER00 inch display is expected to include a curved oled display the other two models are expected to use liquid crystal displays. although prices for the devices havent leaked it stands to reason to expect the 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch models to come in at roughly the same price points as the prior iphone models. the new 00NUMBER00 inch model would presumably come in at an even higher price point. for those premium models id expect apple to limit them to 00NUMBER00 gigabyte and 00NUMBER00 gigabyte storage configurations in line with what the company is doing with the jet black iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus today and id expect at least a 00NUMBER00 price premium between 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch iphone models with comparable storage capacities. i find it extremely unlikely that the costs of the curved oled display and the additional device manufacturing complexity will outweigh such a significant pricing premium. a premium iphone with a curved display and potentially other points of differentiation relative to the more mainstream models would be quite a novel device. for more price insensitive iphone buyers and id suspect that there are a fair number of them the improved display quality and overall device aesthetic could be worth a significantpremium. in that case apple could not only charge enough for the next generation 00NUMBER00 inch iphone to maintain a similar margin structure to its more mainstream models but it would also probably be able to up its margins on the device. its likely to only be a matter of time before apple starts including oled displays on all of its iphone models so it might be reasonable to assume that apple will eventually need to take a cost structure hit down the line. i disagree with that assumption. oled displays are currently believed to be more expensive than high end liquid crystal displays but as more display panel manufacturers focus their efforts to develop oled technology and put manufacturing capacity in place to build oled based displays pricing is likely to come down significantly. i suspect that by the time apple is ready to use oled displays across its iphone lineup the premium between oleds and high end lcds will be small enough that wider adoption of oleds ultimately wont hurt apples bottom line much if at all. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the

here. this podcast was recorded on oct. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. dylan lewisin my eyes pretty solid quarter. they met expectations they set guidance that put them back on to at least some sort of growth for at least the next quarter. we had a listener tweet and i think this is something that probably a lot of people are wondering you say ok they checked the boxes in a lot of ways. why are they 00NUMBER00 they reported the initial reaction when you saw iphone units was positive and pretty much after that theyve fallen off and havent really recovered. two and a half percent is nothing to go crazy panicked over but i think its a valid question and its something a lot of people are wondering. what do you thinkevan niu i think it was just kind of in line with expectations. its always hard to know how the market is going to react. its not always just about with the actual consensus number is its also about the whispered number which is this abstract concept of what people actually think. thats the way that analysts work. investors talk up this whispered number oh this is what i have on my official estimates but i think theyll probably go lower or higher. so its always hard to gauge whats actually going to happen. two percent is not a killer move in either direction. i think it was more of just a lack of being impressed if that makes sense. we talked about the gross margin guide wasnt super great. people just have to start accepting that apple is just not a growth machine anymore and thats ok. but some people have trouble with that just because its kind of boring for it to not be a growth machine. lewis yeah. and in fairness this is a company that has historically provided relatively conservative guidance. you almost never see them miss their own guidance marks. they typically meet it or are surprised pretty comfortably. so to show them projecting growth means they must be pretty confident that thats going to happen. they do have some nice tailwinds to support that like i said they have one of the biggest competitors off the market and they also benefit this quarter from a 00NUMBER00 week 00NUMBER00 instead of a 00NUMBER00 week 00NUMBER00. so that should help them out a little bit a couple extra selling days there. but by and large theres nothing in this report from my end that really changes my thesis on this company. niu they do pretty much always get within their guidance. its not like the old days when they would put out this laughably low guidance number a lowball that you could basically ignore. a few years ago they changed to really be more honest to actually give a range that theyre pretty confident theyll get within. and for the most part they have every quarter more or less. i definitely take their guidance at face value these days versus the old days when you could basically just laugh it off because it was a joke. i think maybe thats another reason why they werent as impressed. maybe like you mentioned theres an extra week in this quarter. if the revenue growth is because you get an extra week that doesnt really inspire a lot of confidence in the business. again its not like its a terrible business. but if youre looking skeptically you could say oh youre only going to grow because you had more days to sell in the quarter. maybe thats another thing people were disappointed in. lewis even then returning to a flat quarter in my eyes is great. weve seen this down trend for such a long time that seeing them get back to whether its zero or positive growth its pretty fantastic. dylan lewisowns shares of apple.

unprecedented backlashagainst applenasdaq aapl over its decision to replace all ports on the new macbook pro with usb c which is a big ask since it requires apples large and loyal base of creative professionals to haul around a handful of dongles as part of their daily workflow. as a testament to the concern thisfan made parody video has gone viral. well the good news is that despite the controversy demand for apples latest and greatest notebooks is soaring. we already knew that apple marketing chief phil schiller said that orders for the new macbook pro are already higher than any other prior notebook so thats encouraging. but beyond taking his word for it its good to get some third party data. slice intelligence a third party analytics company says that the new macbook pro has already garnered over seven times the amount of revenue that the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook did in april 00NUMBER00. put another way the new macbook pro has already generated nearly 00NUMBER00 of allrevenue that the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook has collected since launch which also dwarfs the pc competition. image source slice intelligence. unsurprisingly theres also a strong correlation among buyers of the new macbook pro and early buyers of the first apple watch. early adopters are always happy to try out the newest tech independent of the form factor. what were seeing is a textbook case of a very vocal minority that dont speak for the majority. relative to the masses apples base of creative professionals is particularly vocal about the newfound inconvenience that theyre facing. considering the fact that theres a meaningful overlap between the media and creative professionals this voice gets magnified dramatically. what really matters is whether or not apple has put off the mainstream consumer which slices data suggests it has not. its true that were now seeing a blurring of the line between consumer and professional the same line that steve jobs famously demarcated when he came back to apple. if you were to ignore branding and model names when looking at apples laptop lineup it wouldnt be immediately clear which device is targeted at which segment. this all comes at

which the previous generation macbook pro was left without an update or refresh. according to the companys figures 00NUMBER00 of those who bought a macbook in 00NUMBER00 switched to a non aapl laptopfor their next purchase. that trend aligns with apples troubled mac sales numbers which went from defying the overall pc industry by posting modest growth to double digit decreases this year. according to slice dell was the biggest beneficiary of this platform migration. its probably not a coincidence that dell was winning accolades for its new xps 00NUMBER00 laptop reviewed here in 00NUMBER00 even as aapl fans were faced with choosing between the single port new macbook and the aging macbook air and macbook pro lines. it stands to reason that a chunk of those switchers saw what apple has done with the new macbook pro liked it well enough to end their windows adventure and pulled out their credit card. there are a few qualifiers to this report. the first is that slice intelligence tracks online purchases only. so it doesnt cover whats happening in traditional brick and mortar retail locations. apples new laptops arent even available in stores yet while the competition is so that could be skewing the e commerce numbers to favor aapl. the second is that that the data is only for the first five days the new macbook pro was available for purchase. its possible that macbook sales have cooled since then. finally the numbers are for revenue not units sold. a new macbook pro can cost twice what the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook does so seven times the revenue could depending on the model mix for both laptops translate into three or four times the actual number of units sold. apple inc. aapl stock facing backlash over new macbook prohowever despite the qualifiers it does seem like apple has a genuine and somewhat unexpected hit on its hands. the degree to which it is outselling the pc competition and that fact that in five days it has come close

reportedly include 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch liquid crystal displays while a third so called premium option will use a curved oled display. image source apple. interestingly in the new york times review of this years iphone 00NUMBER00 the site said the next generation iphone will have a full screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen citing sources within apple. i believe that to enable this form factor in the models incorporating liquid crystal displays apple may use a new technology that longtime iphone display supplier japan display called a full active liquid crystal display or lcd. according to japan display a full active lcd uses a new high density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies to reduce the bottom bezel of a smartphone to be as narrow as the other three sides. this newly designed lcd module structure will allow the size of a smartphone device to be nearly the same as the display size a press release from japan display reads. japan display also said it aims to start mass production of this display by the end of march 00NUMBER00. this suggests that the technology should be ready in time to support next generation iphone launches. the technology described here looks as though it should be able to enable apple to build the full screen face smartphone that the new york timesdescribed. additionally japan display laid out a road map during its most recent earnings call showing how it expects this full active lcd technology to evolve. in 00NUMBER00 the company expects this technology to deliver low power consumption. then in 00NUMBER00 the company expects this technology to be flexible which should allow for curved displays such as what oled displays allow for today. this table from japan display shows a table pitching the advantages of japan displays yet to be released third generation full active lcds against oled technologyimage source japan display. note though that japan displays moneymaker is lcds. its still working to develop oled tech for mobile devices. in any event japan display claims advantages in power efficiency brightness viewing angles lifetime cost and designability. itll be interesting to see how these seemingly bold claims hold up when production displays make their way into customers hands. although next years premium iphone model is expected to get a curved oled display i wonder if apples game plan is to continue to use lcds in lower end iphone models over the next several years rather than switch everything to oled for cost reasons. should japan display and other lcd makers continue to advance lcds to make them competitive with oleds in the areas that matter then the technology may have a fairly long term future in smartphones and tablets. nevertheless its also important to understand that oled technology wont stand still either. oled technology has made significant strides over the past several years and its very likely that it will increasingly be the display technology of choice for very high end smartphones and other mobile devices. unsurprisingly japan display says it will continue to pour money into the research and development of oled technology even as it builds better lcds over time. a secret billion dollar stock opportunity the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something but a few wall street

iphone in cupertino california. now both the beloved plumber with the red hat and overalls and the iconic smartphone maker are poised to have record setting sales this holiday season. but theres more to this relationship than meets the eye. two companies worlds apart have never had their futures more intertwined than they are now as nintendo and apple aapl are now venerably linked at the hip or chip i should say. since nintendo announced super mario run would be coming to the iphone in december more than 00NUMBER00 million people have signed up for notifications when the game will be announced. that number seems likely to grow as the game gets closer to launch and nintendo actually announces the launch date and pricing. apple for owning the app store will get its custom 00NUMBER00 cut of whatever revenue is generated from the game. assuming no growth from that 00NUMBER00 million figure which is hard to believe and an average revenue per user arpu of 00NUMBER00 from the game nintendo stands to make 00NUMBER00 million in revenue and apple 00NUMBER00 million not huge amounts for either company but not exactly nothing either. given the success of pokemon go which has been downloaded more than 00NUMBER00 million times its a good bet that a character as popular as mario is likely to be downloaded significantly more than 00NUMBER00 million times from a user base of over 00NUMBER00 billion devices. in addition nintendo is also likely to benefit from the increase buzz around the company because of pokemon go super mario run and its latest console the nintendo switch. the announcement of nintendo classic edition was met with considerable excitement earlier this year and reviews of the system have been nothing short of astounding. for 00NUMBER00 people can relive their childhood and play 00NUMBER00 classic games such as the super mario bros. series donkey kong tecmobowl and a host of others. gizmodo called it a great gift and said unboxing it almost made the author cry. for apples sake the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have been more well received than anyone in the media and on wall street anticipated. this goes back to brand cache something both apple and nintendo have in spades. apple refreshed nearly its entire product line in the past few months from the iphone to the ipad to the macbook pro. apples legions of fans despite some harsh criticism surrounding the new macbook pro laptops have been buying its products faster than apple and its partners can make them. a look on apples website shows the new macbook pros with touch bar and touchid have longer than usual shipping dates. the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in jet black which seems to be the most desirable of the new lot still has a shipping date of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 weeks nearly two months after it announced. thats a good sign for a company that has struggled to grow revenue in recent quarters. both companies have a history of secretiveness and have been around and more importantly relevant for nearly 00NUMBER00 years in technology a feat that isnt easily done. both have reinvented themselves multiple times have had iconic figure heads and are beloved by millions. with the two companies working relationship seemingly getting closer than ever its not hard to see why as the fortune of one company goes the other may follow. the views and opinions

companies applenasdaq aapl shares have been rather weak in the wake of last weeks election of donald trump. while most of the big names in silicon valley are most threatened by the possibility of tighter immigration laws cutting off their supply of high skilled engineering talent coming from all around the world apple has some unique risks related to president elect trump. specifically apple is one of the few major tech companies that predominantly sells hardware and gadgets devices that are imported from contract manufacturers based in china. during his campaign trump made vows to impose a wide range of protectionist import tariffs. shares fell 00NUMBER00 yesterday on fears that trump will provoke a full on trade war with the middle kingdom which chinas state runglobal times vowed would be painful for both countries even calling out the iphone by namechina will take a tit for tat approach then. a batch of boeingorders will be replaced by airbus. u. s. auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and u. s. soybean and maize imports will be halted. china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the u. s. how much should apple shareholders be worriedthe market hates uncertainty but unfortunately theres no real indication as to whether or not trump will follow through on his plan to impose an import tariff. thats actually true of many parts of trumps campaign given his fundamental unpredictability. no one knows what will prove to be just rhetoric or what trump will actually try to do. for what its worth trump toldthe new york times earlier this year that he would attempt to impose a 00NUMBER00 import tariff on goods coming in from china only to deny a week later that he said that. the new york timesresponded by releasing the audio recording of trump citing the 00NUMBER00 tariff. jacking up the entry level price of an iphone from 00NUMBER00 to over 00NUMBER00 would certainly hurt apple and its competitiveness. the silver lining is that a 00NUMBER00 import tariff isnt likely to happen. trump will have some ability to raise tariffs if he really wants to just probably not by 00NUMBER00. presidents are only allowed to impose tariffs of up to 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 days in order to address balance of payments deficits thanks to the trade act of 00NUMBER00. however a president can raise tariffs under the trade expansion act of 00NUMBER00 if the purpose is to strengthen national security. theres also the international emergency economic powers act of 00NUMBER00 that allows the president to restrict trade due to a national emergency. even if trump cant implement a massive 00NUMBER00 tariff the president does have the ability to unilaterally impose sometype of tariff under various circumstances. on the campaign trail trump called out apple by name on numerous occasions saying he would force the mac maker to bring manufacturing back to the u. s. in january trump said were going to get apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries. a couple months later he said apple and all of these great companies will be making their products in the united states not in china vietnam. unfortunately for trump its simply not possible for apple to bring back manufacturing. steve jobs bluntly told president obama in 00NUMBER00 those jobs arent coming back. its not just about labor costs either. over the past couple of decades the u. s. shifted away from type of mid level manufacturing engineering thats needed to manufacture things at this scale. when apple was developing the original iphone it needed almost 00NUMBER00 industrial engineers to work on manufacturing. it would have taken 00NUMBER00 months to recruit that army in the u. s. apple did it in china in two weeks. not to mention the fact that beyond contract manufacturing the majority of apples component supply chain is based in asia. if apple were to theoretically even try to bring manufacturing stateside the massive logistics costs of shipping components and other parts of the value chain all around the world would offset a meaningful portion of what it would be trying to avoid in import tariffs particularly as those components would presumably be subject to import tariffs. in other words short of the entireglobal consumer electronics supply chain moving from asia to the u. s. no u. s. based consumer electronics company could completely escape the potential of increased import tariffs. but more importantly if the end goal of bringing a meaningful number of manufacturing jobs back to the u. s. via a trade war is unrealistic and literally impossible and the consequence would be to devastate the u. s. economy then hopefully trump wont pull the tariff trigger. forget the

of information about upcoming applenasdaq aapl products including the companys iconic iphone product line. thats why when he publishes details of apples future product plans investors pay close attention. image source apple. in a recent note to investors by way of macrumors kuo offers up some predictions about next years iphone lineup which will presumably be marketed as the iphone 00NUMBER00. in line with previous rumors kuo says apple is planning to launch three iphone variants next year. however the details of these reported models differ from what have been reported previously. according to kuo the first device in the upcoming lineup will come with a 00NUMBER00 inch liquid crystal display lcd and a single lens camera the second will sport a 00NUMBER00 inch lcd with a dual lens camera. the third per the analyst will be a device with an organic light emitting diode or oled display. the last one is also expected to come with a dual lens camera. kuo doesnt specify the display size of the oled equipped model in this note though as macrumors points out he indicated in a prior note that it would use a curved 00NUMBER00 inch display. nikkei asian review on the other hand said the next generation iphones will come in three variants the first two packing 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch lcds and the third sporting a 00NUMBER00 inch curved oled display. the lineups described by both kuo and nikkei asian review both seem plausible lets take a closer look at both. the lineup kuo predicts would represent a straightforward expansion of the current iphone lineup with apple simply offering a third screen size option in addition to its current 00NUMBER00 inch and 00NUMBER00 inch display options. further if apple is as the new york timesreports planning to move to full screen faces on its next generation iphones potentially enabled by a new tech from japan display then it could deliver these classic display sizes in much smaller device footprints. thatd be a win for users happy with the display sizes on their current iphones but who want smaller or sleeker devices. the lineup that nikkei asian review reports will come to market next fall also has merit. theres probably a good number of iphone users willing to pay a premium for features such as a sharper display and a dual lens camera but dont necessarily want jumbo sized 00NUMBER00 inch displays. a 00NUMBER00 inch in between option for those customers would probably be quite compelling to those customers itd also probably be good for apples iphone average selling prices as 00NUMBER00 inch models would probably be priced as the current 00NUMBER00 inch models are today. further by offering a premium 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 inch oled display bearing model at an even higher price point targeting customers who did enjoy the large 00NUMBER00 inch display on the prior plus models apple could further enrich its iphone average selling prices. both potential lineups look compelling but only one set is going to make it to market next september. itll be interesting to see what apple ultimately goes with and what impact on apples iphone unit sales market share and average selling prices next years lineup ultimately has. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter they

trying to figure out what a trump administration holds in store for their positions. thats much easier said than done considering the fact that the president elect hasnt been particularly forthright with detailed plans on any of his proposed policies. one issue that trump campaigned on was his support of alleviating taxes on repatriating cash arguing that allowing corporations to bring funds home at favorable tax rates would translate into domestic investment that would in turn spur economic activity stateside. of course that was the argument for the last repatriation holiday in 00NUMBER00 and most of the cash that companies brought back was promptly returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. there are valid arguments for and against a repatriation holiday but most lawmakers are against repatriation holidays because the government ends up losing tax revenue over the long term the holidays simply encourage more profit shifting as companies just wait around hoping for the next repatriation holiday. trumps site from his campaign calls for relief it will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one time tax rate of 00NUMBER00 percent. this is a slightly higher rate than the 00NUMBER00 holiday which allowed companies to repatriate cash at 00NUMBER00. its worth noting that trumps site after becoming president elect does not include details on repatriation so its not clear where trump currently stands on this issue. you may have noticed that i didnt refer to trumps proposal as a holiday. its a minor semantic distinction but its important. there are three broad ways that lawmakers have proposed dealing with foreign cash hoards which now total approximately 00NUMBER00 trillion. there is a transition tax a stand alone deemed repatriation or a repatriation tax holiday. deemed repatriation is sort of a hybrid of the other two so you could arguably apply holiday to deemed repatriation due to its one time nature as well. the center on budget and policy priorities a nonpartisan research and policy institute provides this handy tableimage source cbpp. the way that deemed repatriation would work is that the government would impose a one time tax on all foreign profits that are currently being held overseas. the most important distinction is that unlike a pure holiday which allows for optionalrepatriation deemed repatriation is compulsory and the tax would be imposed regardless of whether or not companies actually brought that cash back. the u. s. government would be able to use the incoming revenue for things like infrastructure but it doesnt guarantee that companies will actually repatriate cash. but if theyre paying the tax anyway many companies will probably choose to repatriate. much digital ink has been spilled regarding applesnasdaq aapl massive and growing foreign reserves which now stand at 00NUMBER00 billion. the mac maker has long tapped the debt markets as a roundabout way to raise domestic cash while avoiding repatriation taxes funds that it uses to pay dividends and repurchase stock. but that strategy has inherent limits as apple has now amassed nearly 00NUMBER00 billion in long term debt. at the same time ceo tim cook has already stated that apple is planning on repatriating a large chunk of cash as early as next year noting that the company has provisioned several billion dollars for taxes without elaborating further. it seems that some level of repatriation is already on the table for apple. using trumps proposed 00NUMBER00 deemed repatriation rate apple could be facing a one time tax bill of 00NUMBER00 billion. that doesnt sound like savings and whether or not apple actually saved money depends on how much it was already planning on bringing home. here are just some theoretical scenarios. amount repatriatedstatus quo tax 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 billionsource authors calculations. ive skewed toward higher amounts here on purpose. under normal circumstances its very unlikely that apple would have been considering repatriating 00NUMBER00 billion or more and i highly doubt that the amount cook was thinking of approached 00NUMBER00 billion. but if trump enacts his deemed repatriation rate of 00NUMBER00 apple has an incentive to repatriate more while it still can as its savings increase in lockstep. its also unrealistic to think that apple would repatriate as much as 00NUMBER00 billion since it still needs foreign reserves to continue expanding its international retail presence as well as capital spending for product tooling and manufacturing infrastructure that resides within partner facilities in asia. the more that apple repatriates under this hypothetical scenario the longer it can fund its capital return program without turning to capital markets. none of this is to suggest that a trump administration would be pro apple by any means. the president elect has already demonized apples globalization as part of his nationalist oriented campaign and a trade war would definitely hurtif trump goes through with it. but if trump and a republican congress move forward with a deemed repatriation bill apple could actually benefit. forget the 00NUMBER00 election

applenasdaq aapl has set a difficult bar for itself. it can put up numbers that most companies would be thrilled to have and still be considered a failure based on past results. thats whats happening with the release sales for the new iphone 00NUMBER00. apple has managed to get a seemingly impressive number of customers to buy its latest phones according to analysisfrom consumer intelligence research partners cirp but the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus launch still lags behind the companys most successful release. since the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launched on sept. 00NUMBER00 cirp estimates that 00NUMBER00 of iphone buyers in the united states purchased one of the two new models. that seems like a very high number even for a year with a new model number as opposed to the s years which involve a lesser upgrade but for apple its only a middling result. cirp partner said josh lowitz in a press releasethe iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launch falls between the wildly successful iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launch in 00NUMBER00 and the somewhat disappointing launch of the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in 00NUMBER00. . . the combined share for the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launch is up slightly from the 00NUMBER00 share for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in 00NUMBER00 and down considerably from the 00NUMBER00 share for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus benefited from a new form factor a larger screen and the introduction of the even larger and premium priced plus model. image source cirp. even though the amount of people choosing to buy the new models rather than a still available older one has dropped from the 00NUMBER00 highs the company has managed to keep the same percentage of users about one third buying the bigger more expensive plus model. thats up from around 00NUMBER00 who opted for the larger pricier phone in 00NUMBER00. average selling price and gross margins suffered with the launch of the iphone se earlier this year which continues to account for a meaningful percentage of sales. we expect the strength of the higher priced plus phones will boost average selling prices and margins lowitz said. oddly enough the percentage of android users switching to iphone 00NUMBER00 was sort of the opposite of the overall sales pattern. the number of android users who switched to the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus came in at 00NUMBER00. thats better than the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 but worse than the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00. the two more successful iphone launches in the last three years were driven by existing loyal iphone owners who upgrade to a new iphone model and rely less on android owners who switch to an iphone said cirp partner mike levin. when apple launched the less compelling iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus models in 00NUMBER00 existing iphone owners essentially sat out the upgrade cycle. 00NUMBER00 of apple customers upgrading to the newest most expensive phones is still pretty impressive. despite numerous internal upgrades in reality its hard to think apple will hit its peaks with any model that does not have a noticeable physical change over earlier iphones such as with the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus. in this case the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus have some minor physical differences from the various 00NUMBER00 models as well as the expected improved processors cameras and more storage on the entry level models but they just arent that different from their predecessors. apple has trained people to upgrade every year but they have also taught some value seeking buyers that older models get cheaper when new ones come out. these are good numbers which nearly any other company would be happy to be able to deliver. apple may not have delivered an unquestioned grand slam but it has served up something between a home run and a stand up triple. forget the 00NUMBER00 election 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than appledonald trump was just elected president and volatility is up. but heres why you should ignore the

the apple earnings report. im your host dylan lewis and im joined on skype by foolcom senior tech specialist evan niu. evan hows it goingevan niubusy week a lot of tech stuff. lewisa lot of earnings coming in. niua lot of product announcement. lewisyeah a lot coming in from apple. lets talk a little bit about what they reported in terms of numbers. maybe well get into some of the product discussion a little bit later on. 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue on the top line more or less in line with expectations down from 00NUMBER00 billion a year ago. but that is to be expected we knew that was coming no surprises there. eps earnings per share at 00NUMBER00 was actually slightly above what expectations were. the two big numbers that people immediately focus on it seems like apple delivered a pretty solid quarter. niuyeah. i think it was right on target. i dont think there was really any big upsides and downside surprises. the way i look at it this is the most boring quarter of all the seasons because its right before the iphone launched. you get a couple weeks of the new iphone sales but generally speaking 00NUMBER00 is just not a super exciting time for consumer electronics companies. lewisyou mentioned the iphone. we might as well head in straight into the discussion on that product. the company sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones at an asp average selling price of 00NUMBER00. that amounts to about 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue good for about 00NUMBER00 of apples top line. weve seen that trend down a little bit. i think its stabilized in the high 00NUMBER00 low 00NUMBER00. it isnt quite the two thirds amount it used to be. niuyeah. on a trailing 00NUMBER00 month basis its still about 00NUMBER00. its still pretty far up there. one thing i did notice that was interesting was apple did not disclose this whole thing about installed base related purchases that theyve been doing for the past three quarters. as we talked about before theres this effort  in my opinion to shift attention away from unit sales. but they didnt do that this time which is weird like are they not trying to do that anymorelewisyeah any time you introduce a new metric especially a non gaap metric youre shifting attention somewhere. and for them to go silent on that makes you wonder exactly whats going on there. niuyeah its a weird change of tune. ive been keeping track of this number and i was expecting to plug it into my sheet and they just didnt have it. lewisone number i think a lot of people have to be pretty optimistic about is the general trend with asp. i said 00NUMBER00 thats up from the previous quarter and it seems like theres some more upside there. niuright. the main thing to remember is that the reason why it was down over the summer was because of the iphone se launch which starts at 00NUMBER00 which was the lowest price point that apple has ever sold an iphone directly even if you factor in how they bring these older models down by price point every year. the lowest theyd ever gone before was a three year old iphone would go for 00NUMBER00. then they came out with the se which starts at 00NUMBER00. it was a pretty aggressive play to get smaller phones and first time adopters with a lower entry price. that put a meaningful impact on asps which was 00NUMBER00 last quarter which was the lowest its been in about two years. they did say on the phone they expect asps to climb back up to where they were last december quarter which for reference was 00NUMBER00. so i think we should start to see that number start to 00NUMBER00 again particularly if they can meet iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand which theyre having a hard time doing because the iphone is so expensive they can increase that price by 00NUMBER00 to last year. the 00NUMBER00 plus will really push asps up i think. lewisand part of the justification with that incremental 00NUMBER00 on the price point was the camera. that was the major selling point and thats how management pointed to that decision. niuyeah. they specifically said it was the camera. they were asked about it and they were like we put a ton of innovation into the dual camera system. i do think that is very specifically whats the reason for that 00NUMBER00. lewisone of the things i thought was particularly interesting with the commentary from this report was you look at the services segment you look at the last couple quarters youve seen service segment revenue up 00NUMBER00 and theyre really touting this number. most recently it was 00NUMBER00 billion which is roughly 00NUMBER00 of revenue. at this point were coming up on two full years of them breaking out services as a product segment. looking backwards weve seen a huge step change in the fiscal 00NUMBER00 quarter. in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 we were at 00NUMBER00 billion. that hopped up a full billion dollars in the following quarter fiscal 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00. so im really curious looking forward what that segment might look like. theoretically we should be in the step change quarter. itll be interesting to see if they can sustain that growth or if were going to continue to see them hum along at more or less flat sequential growth. niuyeah services is becoming huge. like you said its 00NUMBER00 billion. and if you look at the past four quarters this is now basically a 00NUMBER00 billion business. thats bigger than the mac bigger than the ipad. its their second biggest business at this point which is kind of crazy to think about because apple is typically not that great at services in general. particularly because the services revenue most of it is not coming from a subscription service like apple music that bills every month. thats certainly part of it. but it comes back to what we were talking about earlier which is the whole installed base related purchases. a lot of that services revenue comes from them relying on their users buying content and apps on the app store reliably. thats why that number is important and im surprised they didnt give it. not a whole lot of it is occurring monthly subscription fees that you can count on every month. so it is important but theyre doing a really good job of growing that number. its a pretty big business now 00NUMBER00 billion. lewisits huge. i think you hit on the installed base thing if there are any issues with them growing that installed base it stands to reason that the services segment wont continue to grow the way that it has. thats kind of the relationship there and thats why you always see the step change happen in fiscal 00NUMBER00 because thats when they sell a ton of iphones. youre going to see those two things move together. thats certainly something that im watching in the coming quarter because theyre pointing to it more and more in their conference calls. i think its an indication of a lot of other elements of their business. niuabsolutely. lewislooking forward and looking at the guidance that they provided for the first time since physical 00NUMBER00 of last year apple is guiding for year over year growth next quarter which i think is a welcome sign for a lot of investors. the company is expecting revenue to come in somewhere between 00NUMBER00 billion and 00NUMBER00 billion. when we say year over year growth fiscal 00NUMBER00 last year they posted revenue of 00NUMBER00 billion. so its not going to be huge but it is positive growth. niuill take it. laughslewisyeah at this point looking year over year declines for a little while its certainly a welcome trend to see. i think some people are maybe a little disappointed in this guidance given some of the tailwinds that the business has right now at its disposal. this is something weve talked about in previous shows. one of the major competitors the samsung note 00NUMBER00 being off the market you would think would be a much larger catalyst for apple than maybe theyre letting on. niuyeah. they declined to give any meaningful comment on whether or not they think theyll benefit but i think pretty clearly that they will. and now theres even reports that the galaxy 00NUMBER00 edge is catching on fire. laughs i dont know if youve seen it theres not as many of them. but there were reports starting in september. that was a month ago. again its not as widespread but there are a handful of cases across the world like in china and the philippines with the 00NUMBER00 edge which is one of the phones that samsung is pushing people toward. and heres the crazy part  one of those phone was a replacement for a galaxy note 00NUMBER00. so samsung gives a customer and 00NUMBER00 edge to replace his note 00NUMBER00 that caught on fire and the 00NUMBER00 edge catches on fire laughs its just a mess. lewisthats a bad brand experience there. niui think going back to their guidance i do think the one thing that stood out to me as far as not so great in the guidance was the gross margin guide. the revenue guidance was fine because itll be nice to get a little growth even if its not a lot. we had three consecutive quarters of negative growth up top at this point so i think anything is nice. on the profitability side i was surprised too because in the fourth quarter apple always enjoys a lot of operating leverage when their revenue scales up to these really high levels. usually you see margins expanding in a pretty meaningful way usually to the point where youre at 00NUMBER00. theyre guiding to basically upwards of 00NUMBER00. so 00NUMBER00 basis points shy of what i would expect them to guide to. and for what its worth last year they did 00NUMBER00. lewisin fairness on that 00NUMBER00 figure that was also a quarter where they realized 00NUMBER00 million or so in a patent dispute agreement with samsung. i think that added about 00NUMBER00 basis points to that margin number. i think the true margin number was like 00NUMBER00 or so. niubut if you go back another year it was still like 00NUMBER00. its still pretty close to 00NUMBER00. and i know it doesnt sound like a lot 00NUMBER00 basis points but when youre talking about a business this big every basis point counts. one basis point is like 00NUMBER00 million. so multiply that by 00NUMBER00 and thats gross profit coming straight down through the income statement. theyve been talking a lot about commodity costs and component costs being very favorable. so im wondering why that guidance wasnt stronger. its also possible that there are some currency effects because theyve been battling the strengthening dollar for a really long time. thats very much hurting them because about two thirds of revenue comes from outside the u. s. the strengthening dollar has been hurting them for many quarters. so that could also be part of it. i think that might have been why the original market reaction was negative. if youre watching after hours the stock jumped on the iphone number as soon as it was released started getting back those gains as people read through the numbers and started digesting them a little bit. lewisyeah and were going to hit on that in the second half of the show also talk about a couple things that analysts are concerned about and whether theyre really a cause for concern. but before we do i wanted to give a shout out to our friends at criquetshirtscom. criquet makes comfortable and sharp looking polo

earnings. this came up in the conference call from a couple different folks. ive seen some people worried about whats going on with the rd spend research and development side of apples expenses and whats going on in china for them. do you want to hit on that a little bitniui think there are some questions about why is rd expenditure growth growing at this accelerated pace apple is really good at efficiently spending on rd. a few years ago it used to always be 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of revenue range which is tiny. a lot of other tech companies are like 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. google and microsoft thats how much they spend of their revenue on rd. its not as if the more you spend the more innovative. its not linear. it can be wasteful sometimes if youre spending on projects that you never actually commercialize which i think microsoft has a tendency to do. apple has always been really good at only really putting this money into things they know they can commercialize later on. but now in the past few quarters were seeing this number rise to this 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 of sales at the same time that revenue is slowing down so theres a lot of questions of whats going on here the obvious answer is theyre spending money on these things for the pipeline that they wont talk about. lewiswhich is maddening as an investor. theyre like dont worry were spending it well were allocating resources great just trust us. niujust trust us. yeah. there was this talk of a car and clearly a car is incredibly expensive to develop. who knows if they actually do it theres all these conflicting reports on where apple is or is not heading with this car idea. but that is certainly as far as expenses go extremely expensive on the rd front. theres things like augmented reality virtual reality ai. there are a lot of things apple is certainly exploring here but they cant talk about. so theres a real question i think at this point. yeah we know theyre spending this money and we can probably guess on what based not only on where apple specific rumors are coming from but also where the tech industry is going. we know everyone is working on these things. so the real question will be can they do these things and when they do launch them will they be compelling will they be better than everyone elses will they actually drive the business even more and you just have to wait. lewisyeah unfortunately its a wait and see type of thing for investors. im not freaking out about it yet but i think its a good thing to monitor. niudefinitely. lewiswhat about whats going on in chinaniuchina there was this big thing sales were down 00NUMBER00. last quarter they were down 00NUMBER00. the quarter before that they were down 00NUMBER00. if you just look at these year over year numbers it looks really bad. but you have to realize theyre just facing tough comps because they did so well in 00NUMBER00. if you zoom out a little bit and look at their business on an annual basis this is still a 00NUMBER00 billion business in china. last year it was a 00NUMBER00 plus billion business. and the year before it was like 00NUMBER00 something billion. this is still very much headed in the right direction. i used to track their greater china sales before they actually broke it out and exposed it in this lush detail. if you go back to fiscal 00NUMBER00 i think they did less than 00NUMBER00 billion in sales that year. youd have to basically stitch these numbers together from conference call comments which i used to do. now they give it to you directly. but i used to dig these numbers up. i think it was 00NUMBER00 million in fiscal 00NUMBER00. that was seven years ago. now theyre basically 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billion. you cant argue with the long term trajectory of it. and theres still a lot of room to grow this is nowhere near the end game. china is still nowhere near saturated theres still tons of first time smartphone buyers. the middle class is still booming. theres just a couple of tough comparisons because they did so well last year. i wouldnt worry too much. its just this noisy quarterly trends quarter to quarter its tough to call. and yeah theres certainly some competition coming in from these lower end android makers like xiaomi and all these other local players. at the same time i dont think theres a lot to worry about. theres still a lot of room to grow in terms of physical geographic footprint. they dont have that many stores still they only have about 00NUMBER00 stores or so. i dont think theres anything to worry about even if these past few quarters look scary on paper. lewisyeah if you choose to look at their numbers on a two year comp instead of a year over year comp they look pretty darn impressive rightniuright. lewisso thats something to keep in mind. in my eyes pretty solid quarter. they met expectations they set guidance that put them back on to at least some sort of growth for at least the next quarter. we had a listener tweet and i think this is something that probably a lot of people are wondering you say ok they checked the boxes in a lot of ways. why are they 00NUMBER00 they reported the initial reaction when you saw iphone units was positive and pretty much after that theyve fallen off and havent really recovered. two and a half percent is nothing to go crazy panicked over but i think its a valid question and its something a lot of people are wondering. what do you thinkniui think it was just kind of in line with expectations. its always hard to know how the market is going to react. its not always just about with the actual consensus number is its also about the whispered number which is this abstract concept of what people actually think. thats the way that analysts work. investors talk up this whispered number oh this is what i have on my official estimates but i think theyll probably go lower or higher. . . so its always hard to gauge whats actually going to happen. 00NUMBER00 is not a killer move in either direction. i think it was more of just a lack of being impressed if that makes sense. we talked about the gross margin guide wasnt super great. people just have to start accepting that apple is just not a growth machine anymore and thats ok. but some people have trouble with that just because its kind of boring for it to not be a growth machine. lewisyeah. and in fairness this is a company that has historically provided relatively conservative guidance. you almost never see them miss their own guidance marks. they typically meet it or are surprised pretty comfortably. so to show them projecting growth means they must be pretty confident that thats going to happen. they do have some nice tailwinds to support that like i said they have one of the biggest competitors off the market and they also benefit this quarter from a 00NUMBER00 week 00NUMBER00 instead of a 00NUMBER00 week 00NUMBER00. so that should help them out a little bit a couple extra selling days there. but by and large theres nothing in this report from my end that really changes my thesis on this company. niuthey do pretty much always get within their guidance. its not like the old days when they would put out this laughably low guidance number a lowball that you could basically ignore. a few years ago they changed to really be more honest to actually give a range that theyre pretty confident theyll get within. and for the most part they have every quarter more or less. i definitely take their guidance at face value these days versus the old days when you could basically just laugh it off because it was a joke. i think maybe thats another reason why they werent as impressed. maybe like you mentioned theres an extra week in this quarter. if the revenue growth is because you get an extra week that doesnt really inspire a lot of confidence in the business. again its not like its a terrible business. but if youre looking skeptically you could say oh youre only going to grow because you had more days to sell in the quarter. maybe thats another thing people were disappointed in. lewiseven then returning to a flat quarter in my eyes is great. weve seen this down trend for such a long time that seeing them get back to whether its zero or positive growth its pretty fantastic. anything else before i let you go

source apple. applenasdaq aapl might be thinking about doing the unthinkable bringing iphone production back home. thenikkei asian review is exclusively reporting that the mac maker asked its two primary iphone contract manufacturers foxconn and pegatron to evaluate the possibility of assembling iphones in the u. s. foxconn did an evaluation per apples request but pegatron reportedly didnt want to bother with it because of cost considerations. apples move wasnt in response to donald trumps election victory but its possible that the tech titan was exploring the idea pre emptively. apple made the request in june and trumps campaign focused heavily on using tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing while also demonizing apple for manufacturing products abroad. the president elect posed this question to supporters in march vowing that he would get apple to start making their computers and their iphones on our land not in china. the answer is or at least should be incredibly obvious. china is the most efficient and cost effective place for apple to churn out hundreds of millions of iphones. the nikkeireport quoted a source saying making iphones in the u. s. means the cost will more than double. thatis how it benefits u. s. consumers. lower costs translate into lower retail prices. apple has its margin target that it needs to hit so any increases in its underlying cost structure will indubitably be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. the entire electronics supply chain is centralized in asia which yields logistics and research and development efficiencies. having a supplier being physically located close to where the devices are produced makes it easier to address problems that arise and streamline the build out of manufacturing infrastructure. for instance heres a map of apple suppliersapple has hundreds of suppliers across asia. image source apple. beyond cost the labor pool in asia is also much more able to handle this type of work. in an interview with charlie roselast december ceo tim cook explained the situationlet me be clear china put an enormous focus on manufacturing. in what we would call you and i would call vocational kind of skills. the u. s. over time began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. i mean you can take every tool and die maker in the united states and probably put them in a room that were currently sitting in. in china you would have to have multiple football fields. apple has to do its due diligence in researching the possibility. the company has to take trumps rhetoric seriously and evaluating options is completely expected. however apple will likely find that its just not possible or worth it even if trump enacts some type of import tariff. its a very real possibility that the costs to move manufacturing to the u. s. at a meaningful scale would be so prohibitive that it would be better to deal with a potential tariff. the company has moved some manufacturing to the u. s. but those are lower volume products like the mac pro. i dont think theres any realistic way that apple moves the bulk of iphone production stateside. forget the 00NUMBER00

such as optical zoom and a simulated bokeh depth of field effect. interestingly although the primary lens in the dual lens subsystem includes a feature known as optical image stabilization the secondary lens does not. image source apple. this means that image quality can suffer in photos and videos produced by both lenses compared to those produced by just the primary lens. per kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo via macrumors this is set to change with next years dual lens bearing iphone models. kuo expects that the secondary camera in next years dual lens iphone models will have optical image stabilization on both the primary and secondary lenses. that change kuo says could lead to enhanced image quality as well as a greater range for the optical zoom feature the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus only supports 00NUMBER00 optical zoom. its clear from kuos note why apple didnt include this feature on this years model significant technical challenges. kuo argues that the secondary lens will need to be redesigned to support optical image stabilization. furthermore he outlined two major challenges that apple will face in trying to add this technology to the second lens. first kuo says apple will need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes sic. next he argues apple will need to develop a redesign of the telephoto lens as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners. although this stuff sounds daunting its important to remember that apple has dramatically ratcheted up its research and development spendingover the last several years. this means at the very least apple should have the brainpower and the budget to get it done. based on comments from apple ceo tim cook apple appears to have underestimatedthe demand that it would see for its iphone 00NUMBER00 plus smartphones. indeed demand so outweighs supply at this point that cook couldnt confidently tell investors that the company would exit the current quarter having achieved supply to demand balance on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus smartphones. clearly theres something that consumers like about this years larger iphone model. id wager that the inclusion of a dual lens camera this time around was a significant contributor to the relatively robust demand that apple is enjoying for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the good news is that by making an already compelling feature even better apple will as kuo says enhance the selling points of next years new iphone. offsetting that though will be a couple of factors. firstly the jump from a single lens camera to a dual lens camera is likely much more impressive to the general consumer than a move from a good dual lens camera to a better one. apples marketing teams must do a good job of trying to convince the average consumer that the improvements that it makes generation over generation are a big deal. next it is likely that dual lens cameras will become much more commonplace on competing flagship smartphones next year. in addition to highlighting to consumers how the iphone 00NUMBER00 dual lens camera system is better than the one found on last years iphone apple will also need to make sure its implementation is superior to those from its major competitors and if possible market that superiority. that being said apple likely has other major changes in store for next years iphone models so its unlikely to rely solely on an improved dual lens camera as a major selling point. a secret billion

swing trading perspective theyve quickly wiggled into a much brighter spot. active investors and traders should respect the price action in aapl stock and read on to examine how to play the stock long in coming weeks. like other large cap tech stocks apple after overextending itself in early and mid october began to correct in this case following its late october earnings report. from an investor sentiment perspective measured by both my proprietary twitter analytics as well as from an options positioning perspective bullish talk on aapl stock was once again nearing near term extremes just as the company was about report earnings. alone this rarely is a reason to leg into a bearish bet on a stock but if this is confirmed by a notable bearish reversal by price action you typically do see high probability trading setups come to fruition. as such allow me to reiterate once more that as a general trading principle making bets ahead of earnings or other events is a low probability strategy. much higher probability trades tend to set up after events have triggered and upon price confirmation. looking at the multiyear weekly chart ofapple stock we see that shares topped out in april and may of 00NUMBER00. after that aapl began a downtrend that did not come to an end until this past may where it completed a retracement to the bigger picture multiyear uptrend line. click to enlargefrom there apple began to bounce and by july it had overcome the black diagonal resistance line. by september and into october aapl stock had marked its charts with higher highs versus the april highs and thus overcame the intermediate downtrend more visibly. thus the corrective phase that followed in late october into early november can be viewed as a pause in what may be a new intermediate term rally phase. in other words until a significant bearish reversal rears its head and apple stock pushes below its 00NUMBER00 week moving average around 00NUMBER00 the intermediate uptrend should be respected. on the daily chart we see that the late october and early november pullback in aapl stock stopped right at the red 00NUMBER00 day sma which had also offered support in september. this also lined up with the blue horizontal support area which matched up with a 00NUMBER00 retracement of the entire rally from the may lows up into the october highs. click to enlargerespect the support zone around the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 area. traders should consider playing aapl stock from the long side against this level. use the 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 area as a first upside target. like what you see sign up for our daily beat the belle letter and get serges investment advice delivered to your inbox every morning download serges free special report 00NUMBER00 keys

2016-11-21 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.196010376922735,0.224994371048941,0.0002714452254556,since launching its latest generation of iphones two months ago applenasdaq aapl has seen solid but not spectacular demand for the smaller iphone 00NUMBER00. adoption has been somewhat slowerthan for the iphone 00NUMBER00 but not dramatically so. iphone 00NUMBER00 shipments have probably peaked already according to respected apple analyst ming chi kuo. by contrast iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand has been off the charts catching apple off guard. the iphone maker has been working hard to ramp up iphone 00NUMBER00 plus production. these efforts are starting to yield results but apple still has a long way to go to meet demand during the key holiday season. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand still exceeds supply by a wide margin. image source the motley fool. its not unusual for apple to face long running supply shortages for its most popular products. for example in late 00NUMBER00 iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand significantly outpaced apples expectations. in the u. s. apples online store was quoting a wait of three to four weeks for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus as late as mid november. apple ultimately sold 00NUMBER00 million iphones during that quarter up a stunning 00NUMBER00 year over year. it did so despite supply lagging demand right through the end of the quarter. for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus 00NUMBER00 is shaping up to be a repeat of 00NUMBER00. on apples earnings call last month ceo tim cook candidly told analysts that he wasnt sure apple would be able to meet all of the demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus by year end. to some extent conservatism in apples initial planning may be to blame for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus shortage. earlier this year apple ended up with too much iphone inventory. in trying to avoid a repeat of that problem it may have gone too far in the other direction. however the recall and discontinuation of samsungs competing galaxy note 00NUMBER00 has probably also boosted iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand. the samsung galaxy note 00NUMBER00 demise may be boosting iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand. image source apple. since the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus went on sale two months ago adoption has been rising steadily. during the first month of availability iphone 00NUMBER00 plus sales easily outpaced the sales pace set by the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in the last two years. if anything the second month of sales was even better. iphone 00NUMBER00 plus adoption has sped up somewhat in the last month according to both fiksu and mixpanel. the change is small enough that it could just be the result of measurement error. nevertheless the evidence suggests that apples attempts to increase iphone productionare working. for the iphone 00NUMBER00 supply has more or less caught up to demand with good availability both in stores and online. for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus both the weekly sales rate and retail inventories appear to be rising modestly. despite some improvements in the past month iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand still outstrips supply by a wide margin. as of the middle of this week apple was still quoting a three to four week wait for all iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models in its online store. it has since reduced that estimate to two to three weeks. this is almost exactly the same timing as 00NUMBER00 when the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus lead time was quoted as three to four weeks until the week before thanksgiving. meanwhile retail availability appears to be very thin at least at the apple store. a handful of u. s. apple stores didnt have a single iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in stock as of friday morning. in general most apple stores are out of stock on most iphone 00NUMBER00 plus configurations especially for the more popular wireless carriers. with less than a week left to black friday iphone 00NUMBER00 plus retail inventories are still thin and the wait time for online orders remains quite long. this looks very similar to the situation two years ago when apple couldnt fully meet demand during the holiday quarter but caught up during january. two years ago iphone 00NUMBER00 supply didnt catch up to demand until january. image source apple. one potential wrinkle is that several major u. s. retailers are including the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in their black friday promotions. for example both targetand best buyare offering 00NUMBER00 gift cards with the purchase of an iphone 00NUMBER00 or iphone 00NUMBER00 plus on an installment billing program. perhaps these third party retailers have secured more of apples scarce iphone 00NUMBER00 plus shipments recently to support their black friday marketing plans. if so its possible that supply at the apple store could quickly improve in late november and early december. however even if thats true apple will have to race to catch up to demand by the end of the quarter. apple is clearly benefiting from strong iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand. this should bolster its gross margin as well as the iphone average selling price. but its still a toss up as to whether apple will reap the full benefit this quarter or if some sales will be pushed into january. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter

shortly after applesnasdaq aapl october mac event where it had been rumored that apple would unveil a new display to replace the discontinued thunderbolt display the company confirmed to reporters that it was exiting the stand alone display business. instead the company collaborated with lg electronics to make a pair of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 displays that could connect via usb c to the new macbook pros. now were seeing that apple is giving up on wireless routers too according to a new bloombergreport. apple has reportedly dissolved its wireless router department a slow process that has taken place over the past year. the company has reassigned those engineers to other product teams that are focused on products like the apple tv. apple currently sells three different wireless routers but there are unlikely to be any new models in the pipeline the last one was introduced three years ago in 00NUMBER00. apple is focusing on more financially important product categories and segments. if you look at displays and routers you will notice a similarity though the underlying technology progresses very slowly. display technology hasnt seen a game changing innovation in years and the shift to oled displays has been incredibly slow for a wide range of reasons. wi fi technology also moves at a snails pace the current 00NUMBER00 standard was introduced in 00NUMBER00. apples airport extreme and time capsule use 00NUMBER00 while the smaller airport express is still stuck on the older 00NUMBER00. the next major progression in wi fi is 00NUMBER00 which isnt expected until 00NUMBER00 or later. data source sec filings. fiscal quarters shown. chart by author. this combination of slow technological progress and low financial significance is a perfect recipe for apple apathy. theres not a whole lot that apple can contribute to pushing these categories forward and its not really worth the effort to try from a financial perspective. strategically having more products within the ecosystem benefits the platform but the effects are marginal when you consider how expansive apples walled garden has become. displays and routers fall into apples other products segment and the most interesting product within that segment is apple watch. beyond apple watch this has never been a particularly important category in terms of financial performance. its more of a catch all bucket for products that dont warrant dedicated disclosure although i would argue that apple watch results shouldbe disclosed since its performance has a lot more relevance to apples future as a nascent product category. beats and ipods are also included in other products as is apple tv. having just bought beats apple seems intent on expanding its headphone offerings. apple is about to release its airpods which also feature an apple designed 00NUMBER00 chip. apple wouldnt go to the trouble of designing the 00NUMBER00 if it wasnt serious about continuing with wireless headphones particularly with the removal of the iphone 00NUMBER00 headphone jack. the company is also making a big push into tv content with a side of being strangely fascinatedwith original content. apples approach to peripheral products is simply evolving. while wi fis slow progress doesnt mean that companies cant innovate consider eero the broader point is that apple would rather focus its research and development efforts on the next big thing. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter they have run for over

00NUMBER00 of the 00NUMBER00 billion in operating profit that the smartphone industry generated during the third quarter of 00NUMBER00. apples ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iphone continues to generate monster profits the press release read. image source apple. rounding out the top four most profitable smartphone vendors were huawei in second place with a 00NUMBER00 operating profit share and vivo and oppo tying for third place with 00NUMBER00 each. all other smartphone vendors which strategy analytics lumped into a category called others generated in aggregate the remaining 00NUMBER00 of the operating profit to be had in the industry during the third quarter. lets take a closer look at what this means for apple investors. on one hand its incredible that apple can gobble up so much of the industrys profits. its performance speaks to the quality of apples business. on the other hand such immense profit share means a couple of thingsapple has limited room to grow its profit share. apples competitors are going to compete fiercely to try to grab additional profit share putting apple on the defensive. now while commanding so much of the industrys profits is risky its not necessarily a doomsday scenario for the company. great companies like apple can often grow the total amount of profit that an industry generates by fundamentally increasing the value the industry delivers to consumers. for example lets suppose apple can persuade a customer to instead of buying a 00NUMBER00 phone from huawei or oppo buy a 00NUMBER00 plus iphone. in this case apple is growing the total profit pool in the industry since apples gross margin dollars on a 00NUMBER00 iphone is going to be much greater than what the alternative phone would generate for whichever company is selling it. doing this isnt easy though. apple pulled it off during the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle when it saw large increases in average selling prices and unit shipments but it was unable to replicate that success in the following iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle. in fact apple lost share during that cycle with its unit shipments declining year over year even in a market that grew. its too soon to tell for sure how the iphone 00NUMBER00 cycle will play out for apple in terms of unit and profit share though the initial success of the higher priced iphone 00NUMBER00 plus model is certainly encouraging. however i believe that all eyes are on apples coming iphone cycle during which the company is expected to release a radically redesigned iphone with a curved oled display. it is during that cycle that apple has the potential to drive both significant unit share gains and a substantial boost in average selling prices. should those things come to pass apples unit revenue and profit share within the smartphone market could be poised to move higher than the 00NUMBER00 it saw in the third quarter of this year. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better

donald trumps election victory was predicated on the idea that trump could reinvigorate u. s. manufacturing and the related jobs. while thats far easier said than done applenasdaq aapl is no stranger to being targeted over its long standing use of contract manufacturers in asia. the president elect has broadly mentioned the possibility of implementing import tariffs as a way to discourage domestic companies from making products abroad and shipping them home to sell even though that risks a potentially disastrous trade war. however instead of using punitive measures trump is now considering offering incentives to encourage domestic production. can a carrot work better than a sticklast week trump sat down withthe new york times for a wide ranging interview covering many topics. trump noted that apple ceo tim cook gave him a calli was honored yesterday i got a call from bill gates great call we had a great conversation i got a call from tim cook at apple and i said tim you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when i get apple to build a big plant in the united states or many big plants in the united states where instead of going to china and going to vietnam and going to the places that you go to youre making your product right here. he said i understand that. i said i think well create the incentives for you and i think youre going to do it. were going for a very large tax cut for corporations which youll be happy about. but were going for big tax cuts we have to get rid of regulations regulations are making it impossible. whether youre liberal or conservative i mean i could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. its gotten to be a free for all. and companies cant they cant even start up they cant expand theyre choking. trump has a tendency to view everything as a financial transaction that can be negotiated so its perfectly expected that his go to tool would be a tax incentive. but money is not apples primary motivation in setting up its supply chain in this way more on this later nor would money likely appeal all thatmuch to the worlds richest company. apple has long argued for comprehensive corporate tax reform even if it meant a notable increase in the mac makers tax bill and trump is already planning on widespread tax cuts for corporations as well as potentially pursuing deemed repatriation which would incentivize apple to repatriate more rather than less after paying a massive one time tax bill. its not clear what specific incentives trump could offer apple beyond whats already on the table. trump is characteristically confident that hell be able to succeed despite very real operational challenges associated with apple actually bringing any meaningful number of manufacturing jobs back to the u. s. beyond labor costs it would be extremely difficult for apple to build up a large work force of manufacturing employees with the right skill sets in tim cooks words vocational kind of skills. additionally most of apples component suppliers are located in asia as well so u. s. manufacturing would also result in substantially higher logistics costs. short of the worlds biggest carrot trump will likely fail at convincing cook and co. to expand apples domestic manufacturing operations in any significant way. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when

low price to earnings ratio of just 00NUMBER00 is completely justified. after all both revenue and eps are down in the trailing 00NUMBER00 months. but some perspective highlighted by a recent consumer intelligence research partners cirp study shows some reasons for investors to remain bullish on the stock. image source the motley fool. with declining iphone sales during apples fiscal 00NUMBER00 dragging revenue and eps lower it might look like apple products are falling out of popularity with consumers. but this isnt the case. indeed apple has been seeing a high rate of customers switching from android to ios and its newest iphone is seeing exceptional adoption rates. these trends are made particularly clear by cirps recent research via 00NUMBER00. consider these two important takeaways from cirps study. 00NUMBER00. android switchersan impressive 00NUMBER00 of iphone buyers in the first month of iphone 00NUMBER00 availability are switching from android according to cirp. while this is worse than a 00NUMBER00 android switcher rate for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus its still notable especially considering its up significantly from the 00NUMBER00 of iphone buyers switching from android during the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launch two years ago. apples own data on iphone buyers switching from android confirms the high level of android switchers observed by cirp. in apples most recent quarterly earnings call ceo tim cook said the company saw more customers switch from android to iphone than ever before in 00NUMBER00. high adoptionif the percentage of customers choosing apples september launched iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus over other iphone models is any indication of how the new phone will fair in the marketplace in fiscal 00NUMBER00 this could be a good year for the new phone. the combined share for the 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus launch is up slightly from the 00NUMBER00 share for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus in 00NUMBER00 said cirp partner and co founder josh lowitz about the percentage of iphone buyers buying the newest models during the first month of availability. with apples android switchers and adoption rates still faring well with the companys latest iphone its difficult to argue that the tech giants devices are falling out of favor in the minds of consumers. apples ability to attract android switchers and compel iphone buyers to upgrade to the companys newest iphone are very important to an investing thesis in apple stock for several reasons. iphone 00NUMBER00. image source apple. first apples iphone accounts for the majority of the companys revenue and profits. at about 00NUMBER00 of revenue and an even larger portion of operating profits the closest product segment is apples services segment which accounts for about 00NUMBER00 of revenue. the iphones popularity with consumers therefore is critical to apples success. second in light of apples conservative price to earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00 a return to growth for apples iphone business could make the stocks price today look like a bargain in retrospect. so studies showing an optimistic market response to the latest iphone help make a case for an outlook for the future apples most important product and subsequently the stock. investors should keep an eye on the rate of iphone buyers switching from android and purchasing the latest version. fortunately since apple tends to provide commentary on these trends during earnings calls investors should be able to get a quarterly update on how the iphone business is resonating with customers. for now though the important product segment is certainly looking good enough to merit the stocks cheap valuation. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like

the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  analyst rod hall recently put out a research note viabarrons suggesting that applesnasdaq aapl upcoming iphone 00NUMBER00 smartphone will carry lower gross profit margin than this years iphone 00NUMBER00 series smartphones. image source apple. hall reportedly suggests that this margin degradation could be driven by a couple of factors. the first is that apples average selling prices may be set to come down due to the transition from an all metal casing to the rumored glass sandwich design. apparently halls fellow analyst narci chang says that the market believes that the reduction in viewable metal area implies a lower average selling price. second hall expects that this all glass design will be more expensive to produce due to a 00NUMBER00 increase in cnc machine hours to produce the chassis. we think the average selling price for the next iphone metal casing will stay at a similar level to iphone 00NUMBER00 plus on a like for like basis but the blended average selling price will rise as blended size becomes bigger the analyst writes. lets take a closer look at this to determine if apple shareholders should worry. lets suppose for this analysis that hall is right and apples iphone gross profit margin comes down some during the next product cycle. lets further suppose that the margin reduction is about 00NUMBER00 and that in the coming product cycle apples average selling prices stay flat something that i believe is unlikely but bear with me. during fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple sold 00NUMBER00 million iphone units for 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue implying an average selling price of approximately 00NUMBER00. lets also suppose that apples average iphone gross profit margin is about 00NUMBER00 apple doesnt break this out but i assume that iphone gross profit margin is better than corporate average of around 00NUMBER00. based on these assumptions apple generated about 00NUMBER00 billion in gross profit from iphone sales in fiscal year 00NUMBER00. a 00NUMBER00 reduction in iphone gross profit margin percentage would translate into 00NUMBER00 billion in total gross profits or a reduction of about 00NUMBER00 billion. it may look as though apple shareholders need to start bracing for a real drop in apples profitability but thats not necessarily the case. if apple were to ultimately design its next generation iphone to carry a lower gross profit margin than the current ones then it would likely only do so if the company felt that the added costs would make for a more compelling product. indeed if apple takes a 00NUMBER00 hit on iphone gross profit margin but winds up generating 00NUMBER00 more iphone revenue than it did in the previous generation because of the new features then apples total gross profit still moves up and ultimately garners higher net income for its shareholders. its worth pointing out though that significant cost structure increases cant be implemented lightly. apple needs to have a high degree of confidence that the higher cost structure will translate into significant revenue growth to ultimately drive better profit growth than itd be able to achieve with cheaper to build products. at this point i dont think it should be taken as a given that apples iphone margin next year will come down. after all even in the face of a higher bill of materials apple could increase its selling prices to compensate. apple could also put the squeeze on its suppliers ultimately hurting theirmargins to preserve apples. thats one of the reasons that apple likes to have multiple sources for critical components more suppliers means greater leverage on apples part. having said all that theres just not enough information available right now either on the cost structure or on apples expected pricing for anybody to be able to reliably predict changes in apples iphone gross profit margin in its upcoming product cycle. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after

2016-11-30 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.186784238097051,0.225539404621181,0.0002862117930577,for applesnasdaq aapl important holiday quarter management is guiding for the companys gross profit margin to drop between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 basis points. when viewed alongside the year over year declines in the three quarters before it this underwhelming guidance for the important profitability metric could be a cause for concern for some investors. image source the motley fool. but a closer look at whats going on with apples gross profit margin suggests the tech giant is probably doing better than it looks when it comes to profitability. for its first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 which coincides with the fourth calendar quarter of 00NUMBER00 apple management expects gross margin to be between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 down from 00NUMBER00. even if apple achieves the midpoint of its guidance range for gross profit margin this would undoubtedly mark a notable decline. but investors shouldnt fret theres good reason for the year over year pullback. when asked about apples lower than expected guidance for its first quarter gross profit margin apple cfo luca maestri broke down the factors that are driving the difference in the year ago gross profit margin and apples 00NUMBER00 basis points in the year ago gross profit margin were driven by a 00NUMBER00 million award for a patent infringement. 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 basis points of the difference between the two periods is simply due to currency headwinds. finally maestri said he expected higher cost structures of new products to negatively impact the year over year comparison. in other words after excluding impacts of apples patent infringement award in the year ago quarter and currency headwinds management only anticipates its first quarter gross profit margin to decline between about 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 basis points year over year. further much of this expected year over year decline in gross profit margin is expected to be a factor of higher cost structures so apples profitability doesnt seem to be suffering from any negative secular trends unless of course this higher cost structure for the quarter is the beginning of a sustained period of rising costs. but its unlikely higher costs are here to stay. apple has dealt with temporary higher cost structures in the past when it launched the ipad mini and at times when it refreshed lots of its product lines around the same time. looking beyond a tough and arguably unfair year over year comparison theres probably an even better reason for apple investors not to be concerned a zoomed out view of apples quarterly gross profit margin over a period of several years shows that a gross margin of around 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 isnt really so abnormal for the company. between the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 and the fourth quarter of 00NUMBER00 apples gross margin has bounced around between about 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. data retrieved from apple sec filings for quarters shown. quarter with an asterisk is the midpoint of managements guidance. chart source author. so apples expected gross profit margin during the first fiscal quarter of 00NUMBER00 certainly isnt anything to be excited about. but its also not worth worrying about. when should investors start worrying about apples gross profit margin if the key metric ever begins to consistently trend downward for more than a few years this could be more indicative of more secular negative factors such as declining pricing power permanently higher cost structures or unfavorable products mix shifts that could be here to stay. of course it doesnt hurt for investors to look into quarter to quarter volatility of apples gross profit margin given how important it is to an investing thesis inapple stock. as a cash cow anything that hinders the companys ability to rake in high levels of profits is worth a closer look. in this particular case the driving force behind apples lower gross profit margin doesnt look like its a problem. indeed id argue that apples gross profit margin today continues to support the companys impressive ability at sustaining pricing power

next year alongside models with standard liquid crystal displays or lcds and its a reallybig deal. image source apple. for instance kgi securities analyst ming chi kuo predicts that the oled iphone will be by far the most popular of the three iphone models that he expects apple to launch next year making up 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 of new iphone models shipped in the current fiscal year via appleinsider. here are three reasons to expect the new oled iphone to dramatically outsell the other iphone models. the oled iphone is expected to feature a new industrial design with a glass back and a display that curves into both sides of the device oled is expected to be critical to enabling this curvature. while the new lcd models may also feature glass backs i expect that from a purely aesthetic point of view the oled iphone will be far more appealing to smartphone shoppers than the lcd models will. additionally iphone shoppers became accustomed to apple putting out new designs every two years. the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus on the other hand retain the same basic shapes as the last two generations of iphones. some iphone customers that might have planned to upgrade older iphone 00NUMBER00 series smartphones to the new design this year might have been disappointed by the look and feel of this years iphone 00NUMBER00 series devices. those customers might find the curved oled iphone 00NUMBER00 to be just the update that theyd been holding out for. display technology expert raymond soneria of display mate technologies says that oleds can have much quicker pixel response times than lcds. a displays pixel response time measured in milliseconds per website displaylagis how quickly it can change its pixels from black to white or gray to gray. displaylag explains the impact that response times can have on user experiencethe response time of a display typically governs how much ghosting a display has. ghosting is the blur that you see on your display trailing objects when there are fast scenes being displayed such a car chase or an action video game likeninja gaiden. a display with a slow response time will show blurring behind moving objects as they are moving and can be very distracting to the human eye. to get a sense of how much faster mobile oled displays can be relative to mobile lcds its worth checking out pixel response times that website notebook check measured for the lcd packing iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and the oled powered galaxy 00NUMBER00. notebook check measured the black to white response time on the iphone 00NUMBER00 pluss display at 00NUMBER00 milliseconds 00NUMBER00 gray to 00NUMBER00 gray came in at 00NUMBER00 milliseconds. in contrast the display on the 00NUMBER00 delivered a black to white response time of 00NUMBER00 milliseconds and a 00NUMBER00 gray to 00NUMBER00 gray response time of just 00NUMBER00 milliseconds. oled mobile displays can clearly be much faster than even the best mobile lcds. apples mobile lcds currently deliver best in class contrast ratios for lcds but they simply cant match the perfect black levels that an oled can deliver. if a customer walks into an apple store and compares an iphone model with an lcd with an iphone model sporting an oled display then the much improved contrast ratio of the oled model is likely to be clear if apple chooses its demonstration wallpapers properly. that comparison could ultimately sway iphone buyers to pay a little bit more for a phone that has a noticeably better display. and if apple charges a premium for the oled iphone model that could help boost apples iphone average selling prices and in turn revenue. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can

apple ceo tim cook quickly fired back stating that the apple watch is on pace for a record performance this quarter. yet many pundits questioned his statement noting that he didnt offer any hard numbers. what are investors to make of these sharply divergent narrativesthe first generation apple watch went on sale in april 00NUMBER00. however the company didnt have a follow up model ready for the anniversary of its introduction this year. while apple cut the price of the sport version by 00NUMBER00 in march 00NUMBER00 and introduced some new bands it was no substitute for offering a new model with better features. this caused apple watch unit shipments to plunge 00NUMBER00 year over year to 00NUMBER00 million during 00NUMBER00 of the calendar year roughly equivalent to apples 00NUMBER00 according to estimates from idc. apple watch sales appear to have fallen significantly in the past two quarters. image source apple. on monday idc reported that apple watch shipment trends worsened further last quarter. unit shipments plummeted 00NUMBER00 from the previous year to just 00NUMBER00 million. that was enough to drop apple from no. 00NUMBER00 to no. 00NUMBER00 in terms of wearables market share. the next generation apple watch series 00NUMBER00 finally arrived on store shelves two weeks before the end of the quarter offering a big upgrade over the first generation product. however initial supply was very limited. any benefit from early shipments of the new model was more than offset by channel inventory reductions for the first generation watch. given that apple now has a new product on the shelves and apple watch series 00NUMBER00 supply has caught up with demand its no surprise that sales are improving. apple also cut the price of the first generation apple watch even further upon releasing the new model stimulating additional sales. the new apple watch series 00NUMBER00 is driving a return to growth for this product line. image source apple. according to tim cook the first week of the holiday shopping season was the best everin terms of apple watch sell through. that measures true demand from end users rather than shipments to retailers where inventory can sometimes linger on store shelves for a long time. apple watch shipments totaled 00NUMBER00 million during the year ago quarter according to idcs estimate. cook indicated that apple is on pace to surpass that performance this quarter but he didnt offer any hints as to how much year over year growth he anticipates. several reporters have pointed to the recent idc report of plunging apple watch shipments and questioned whether cook is somehow twisting the truth with regard to watch sales. some of this criticismmay be due to confusion about what cook meant by sell through. as noted above sell through actually provides the best indication of demand by stripping out inventory fluctuations. furthermore apple announced long before watch sales began that it would not report unit shipment figures for competitive reasons. another likely reason for this lack of disclosure is that watch sales represent a small part of apples total revenue. the lack of hard numbers is the result of long standing corporate policy not some attempt by cook to pull a fast one on investors. some apple bulls have shot back arguing that idc must have dramatically underestimated apples 00NUMBER00 watch shipments. indeed canalys a competing market research company estimated that apple watch shipments totaled 00NUMBER00 million last quarter about 00NUMBER00 higher than the figure cited by idc. be that as it may apples revenue from other products declined 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 million year over year last quarter. the apple watch is one of the biggest contributors to this revenue line so the steep drop in revenue suggests that watch sales did decline on a year over year basis. but given the timing of the series 00NUMBER00 launch near the end of the quarter theres nothing odd about the idea that watch sales declined sharply last quarter and returned to strong growth this fall. if apple watch sales are set to return to growth this quarter thats good news for apple but hardly a game changer. after all apples other products segment produced just 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue in the year ago quarter and the other products category also includes the ipod apple tv beats products and various accessories. perhaps if apple watch sales doubled or tripled this quarter it would be enough to move the needle. but anything less than that would be just a rounding error relative to apples tens of billions of dollars in quarterly iphone sales. its still possible that the apple watch could eventually become a hit producton the scale of the iphone if health insurers start to routinely subsidize apple watch purchases for their customers. aetnarecently began to do just this. it even distributed apple watches to 00NUMBER00 of its own employees to encourage them to pay more attention to their health. until and unless this practice becomes widespread any victories for the apple watch are likely to be small ones. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better

applesnasdaq aapl streaming music service has crossed 00NUMBER00 million subscribers the tech giant announced on tuesday via billboard. the milestone highlights rapid growth for the service and shows how the companys fast growing service is catching up to industry leader spotify. should spotify be worriedapple music. image source apple. when apple launched its latest iphone in september the company said apple music subscribers had just passed 00NUMBER00 million. since the iphone launch therefore apple has added about 00NUMBER00 million subscribers highlighting impressive growth. a jump in apple music subscribers is likely spurred by a few key catalysts. to start new iphone sales thanks to the companys refreshed iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus and the holiday season are undoubtedly driving some subscriptions. with apple music coming pre installed on new iphones a portion of new iphone owners may subscribe to the service by default. in addition apple overhauled its music app this fall focusing on simplifying the service and improving the user experience. the redesign may have helped with retention of new customers and even sparked customers who unsubscribed in the past to subscribe again. finally recent ads with music stars taylor swift and drake along with an ongoing emphasis on exclusives with popular artists are likely helping the service attract new customers. taylor swift in an apple music tv ad. image source apple. however apple isnt satisfied with the size of its service. apples internet software and products vice president eddy cue told billboard of course we want more and we want it to go faster were hungrycue put its 00NUMBER00 million subscribers in context by noting that there are billions of people listening to music and we havent even hit 00NUMBER00 million subscribers. theres a lot of growth opportunity. at 00NUMBER00 million subscribers apple music is beginning to look like a major player next to spotify. sure spotifys 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers doubles apples 00NUMBER00 million. but spotify had a huge head start over apple music spotify hit 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers in 00NUMBER00 about two years before apple music even launched. apple music on the other hand is just 00NUMBER00 months old. further apple musics ability to attract 00NUMBER00 million subscribers between september and early december shows the service is clearly still early in its growth curve. spotify. image source spotify. notably spotify has still been growing strongly even after apple musics debut. spotifys paying members have soared from 00NUMBER00 million in march to 00NUMBER00 million in september. so its not clear yet whether or not apple music can stifle spotifys growth prospects. still despite spotifys continued growth theres good reason to believe apple music could evolve into a threat to spotify. apples 00NUMBER00 plus billion in annual free cash flow essentially gives the tech giant free reign to outspend spotify on advertising exclusives and even product improvements. over time apples big spending on apple music could make it challenging for spotify to compete with the tech giant.

iphone 00NUMBER00 being machined. image source apple. last month reports surfaced that applenasdaq aapl had asked two of its primary contract manufacturers foxconn and pegatron to evaluate the possibility of manufacturing iphones in the u. s. evidently pegatron opted not to research the possibility believing it would be too costly but foxconn complied and gave the idea some serious thought. after all apple is its largest customer so it didnt have much choice but to entertain the idea. while i was and still am skeptical about apple being able to bring back any meaningful number of jobs i. e. beyond a token number of jobs that might primarily serve political purposes based on a wide range of factors like supply chain logistics it turns out that foxconn is seriously exploring the notion of expanding its u. s. operations. foxconn has announced that it is in discussions with the u. s. to potentially invest in expansion. in a statement released earlier today foxconn said while the scope of the potential investment has not been determined we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant u. s. officials. foxconn didnt elaborate on which executives were conducting negotiations or if any of foxconns customers had any input but you can absolutely bet that apple has some strong opinions on the matter behind closed doors. the news comes just a day after japans softbank said it would invest 00NUMBER00 billion in the u. s. and create 00NUMBER00 new jobs. while foxconn mulls the idea keep in mind that this isnt the first time that foxconn has considered expanding manufacturing in the u. s. the contract manufacturer said in 00NUMBER00 that it wanted to assemble smartphones and tablets stateside and again in 00NUMBER00. labor costs have been on the rise in the middle kingdom pinching foxconns margins in the process. foxconn does already have a presence in the u. s. in part to provide timely support to u. s. based customers as well as to facilitate collaboration on product development since manufacturability is critical to scaling. the company has manufacturing and logistics services facilities in a handful of states. foxconn global facilities. image source foxconn. its probably smart for foxconn to remain vague at this point declining to elaborate on any potential expansion in concrete terms. it can score political points by expanding but theoretically keeping any expansion modest would put a lid on costs as labor costs in the u. s. are still meaningfully higher than in china. its also a distinct possibility that a foxconn expansion in the u. s. would focus on areas outside of consumer electronics but its unclear exactly what foxconn has on its mind. but its hard to imagine apple sitting out of these discussions altogether since it has already expressed interest in at least evaluating the possibility. plus any cost increases borne by foxconn would naturally be passed along at least in part to the iphone maker and then subsequently to consumers if foxconn wants to expand smartphone and tablet assembly. despite this new report im still skeptical about apples ability to move any non trivial number of jobs back to the u. s. particularly around the iphone. the supply chain is simply far too embedded in asia to produce the device anywhere else in the volumes that apple needs. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter they have run for over a

of internet software and products eddy cue toldbillboard that the companys highly successful music streaming platform apple music has hit 00NUMBER00 million paying subscribers. apple music has been signing up new customers at an intense impressive rate since its debut back in june 00NUMBER00. at the beginning of this year the platform hit 00NUMBER00 million subscribers and has now less than a year and a half into its existence reached the 00NUMBER00 million milestone. but its still only about half of what its biggest rival spotify has been able to accumulate over the years and thats just spotifys paying subscribers. overall the swedish streaming firm actually has more than 00NUMBER00 million users with many choosing to listen to the ad supported free tier. apple music however is the second biggest streaming platform cruising past other competitors like tidal napster pandora and others. its been quite a year said cue. we were thrilled to see that we could take artists passions and drive them all the way to no. 00NUMBER00. chance the rapper who we put on apple music exclusively hit the top 00NUMBER00 on the  billboard charts based on streams alone and i cant recall that being

decisions and to avoid getting blindsided its important to have a solid understanding of those major risks. image source apple. in applesnasdaq aapl latest form 00NUMBER00 k filing the company describes many potential risks to its business. id like to go over one really important one. heres the second risk factor that apple listed in its most recent form 00NUMBER00 k global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. apple points out that it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products which necessitates significant investments in research and development. in contrast apple says many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the companys products and infringing on its intellectual property. the company further explains that if it cant keep building innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on apples intellectual property then its competitive positioning could be adversely affected. though many investors have a lot of faith in apples product development abilities this risk is hardly theoretical its playing out in the marketplace right now. lets dig deeper. apple seems to suggest that aggressive pricing and very low cost structures go hand in glove. this is often the case particularly in the low end and mid range of the smartphone tablet and pc markets. apples products are generally regarded as premium in both quality and pricing and thus it has a limited to nonexistent presence in these markets its cheapest smartphone the iphone se starts at 00NUMBER00. other companies sell competent smartphones for 00NUMBER00 or less. to the extent that the market shifts to very low priced devices apples competitive positioning weakens apples margin targets dont allow the company to serve lower price points and the company is unlikely to build extremely cost sensitive smartphones for fear of diluting the premium iphone brand. however theres another risk that apple faces. many of the smartphone makers that have built significant businesses at the low end of the market are now trying to participate in the mid range and upper end of the market. some of these vendors like china based meizu try to offer devices with similar features and even aesthetics to apples flagships. for example the pro 00NUMBER00 plus looks a lot like an iphone and offers high end specifications such as a fast processor good camera sensors and an oled display but it sells for the equivalent of about 00NUMBER00 about half the price of apples flagship iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. the meizu pro 00NUMBER00. look familiar image source meizu via the verge. its not clear that meizu can build an equivalent smartphone to what apple can at a lower bill of materials cost. however meizus operating expenses are probably substantially lower than apples for a variety of reasons. apple does more in house technology development and performs significant rd work in relatively high cost regions for example. its also worth noting that apples investors expect the company to be able to generate robust gross profit margins while meizu and other competitors probably dont target anywhere close to that gross profit margin level. there are many smartphones sold particularly in china that look a lotlike apples iphones. in fact there are companies that sell straight up iphone clones albeit with far lower quality software and much weaker hardware. additionally there are phones that look extremely like apples iphone out there and are sometimes marketed in a way that closely resembles apples own marketing campaigns. heresan example. make no mistake apple must compete against such companies to win business. the company has done a good job competing thus far but even it tells investors that there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when

large or mega cap value stocks preferably blue chips with strong balance sheets dependable dividends and a history of hiking those payouts are usually the go to picks. ordinarily such names are found in defensive sectors such as telecommunications utilities and consumer staples. against those criteria apple symbol aapl wouldnt appear to be a good fit. its a growth stock situated in the more volatile technology sector. after all tech stocks are always at risk of being disrupted. todays darlings are too often tomorrows afterthoughts. besides apple has only paid a dividend for a handful of years now and its not all that generous anyway. yet theres a strong argument to be made for apple as part of a diversified retirement portfolio. from cash stockpiles to valuation to the sheer strength of its brand apple is poised to be an income machine. consider these three reasons why. apples liquid holdings are legendary. the tech behemoth had more than 00NUMBER00 billion in cash and securities at the end of its most recent quarter ended september 00NUMBER00. much of that cash is held overseas but the incoming trump administration is talking about cutting taxes on repatriated earnings. either way its an astonishing figure. more remarkable is how fast apple is building up its cash hoard. for the 00NUMBER00 months ended in september apple generated free cash flow the cash profits left over after a company makes the capital expenditures needed to maintain the business of 00NUMBER00 billion after paying interest on debt according to sp global market intelligence. apples cash situation gives it tremendous flexibility. raise the dividend buy back stock execute a bold acquisition apple can afford all three. most important you can rest assured the dividend will keep coming. gushers of free cash also mean apple has ample room to grow its dividend and boy has it ever. the company has hiked its payout every year since it brought back the dividend in 00NUMBER00. indeed over the last four years apple has raised its dividend annually by an average of more than 00NUMBER00. regular dividend hikes are a key to successful income investing because of the way they grow the yield on the original cost basis. dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the share price. the dividend might rise but the price you already paid for shares wont. true at the current payout apples dividend yields just 00NUMBER00 about the same as the yield of standard poors 00NUMBER00 stock index which is certainly no fount of dividends. but a series of hikes will create ever higher yields on your initial investment. consistent and ample dividend increases are an often overlooked aspect of income investing. apple is ostensibly considered to be a growth stock but its sure not priced like one. shares are changing hands at a bit more than 00NUMBER00 times forward earnings. the sp 00NUMBER00 is more expensive than that at a forward price earnings ratio of 00NUMBER00. moreover its not hard to find stocks in the classic value sectors of telecommunications and utilities that are pricier than apple. if anything apple looks like a value stock. the knock on the name is that iphone makes it a one trick pony and its smartphone sales are slowing down. fine. as long as consumers stay within the apple ecosystem and they are famously loyal to the brand upgrades and replacements will ensure steady if not spectacular revenue growth. think of it like an annuity which is acceptable for a value name. finally dont underestimate apples ability to innovate. its been left for dead before. and if it cant find another hit like the iphone and ipod before it it can always afford to buy one. the market might just be too down on apples prospects. apple is a cheap steady dividend payer with a good track record of raising its payouts. as a tech stock its not as correlated with movements in defensive sectors such as consumer staples telecoms or utilities. add it all up and apple looks like a fine way to slip some diversification into your income portfolio during retirement. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the

out of a two month consolidation range to challenge highs seen in october. aapl stock like many big cap tech stocks had been left behind during the post election donald trump rally as investors

silicon valley depend on for cheap programmers. but now with stocks continuing to push to record highs investors are rounding back to laggards in search of value. as a result the breakout in apple stock could be just the start of a protracted new uptrend. the breakout takes apple shares above both their 00NUMBER00 day moving average and their upper bollinger band both indications that a powerful rally is underway. as a reminder shares have been under some pressure since the summer of 00NUMBER00 as iphone sales slowed amid saturation in the smartphone market and the companys iphone

ago. at present the share price of the worlds most valuable company 00NUMBER00 at thursdays close is higher than roughly three quarters of the stocks in the sp 00NUMBER00. when will the nextapple stocksplit come below ill try to answer that question by answering three other questions first. but more important i hope to convince you that any time spent wondering about a possible stock split would be better spent focused on the business itself. source getty imagesapple has split its stock four times since the company went publicapple stock split datesplit ratiopre split pricejune 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00. 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 apple yahoo financethere is only one legitimate reason to split a stock and it is the one apple ceo tim cook invoked in april 00NUMBER00 prior to the most recent split were taking this action to make apple stock more accessible to a larger number of investors. specifically mr. cook was referring to individual investors institutional investors which manage vastly larger pools of money arent concerned whether a stock trades at 00NUMBER00 or 00NUMBER00. how does a stock split affect apple shares intrinsic valueanswer it doesnt not in any way shape or form. heres why. if youre a fundamental investor you understand that the purchase of a stock represents the purchase of a fractional ownership interest in the underlying business. this is one of the core principles of value investing. as such it should be transparent that a stock split has no impact on the shares intrinsic value. sub dividing the current unit of ownership one share into several new shares changes nothing about the business and its prospects nor conversely its risk. its the proverbial pizza whether you cut your pie into four or eight slices does not change the total amount of pizza. typically the announcement of a stock split will impact the stock price as price driven speculators try to eke out a return by trading on the news. fundamental investors or just investors as i like to call them can and should ignore this game the price impact traders expect to capture is temporary and immaterial with regard to the long term returns investors expect to earn. if we were to judge solely on apples first three stock splits we could conclude that the next split might not be that far off. thursdays closing price of 00NUMBER00 is in ballpark of the apples stock price just prior to those splits. however the most recent split which occurred in june 00NUMBER00 with apple trading at nearly 00NUMBER00 suggests that the company is now willing to entertain a significantly higher stock price than in the past. that shift in attitude is consistent with todays higher comfort level among companies in the sp 00NUMBER00 with three or even four digit stock prices. prominent examples include google parent alphabetand amazoncom which closed at 00NUMBER00 c shares and 00NUMBER00 respectively on thursday. lets assume the stock needs to reach at least 00NUMBER00 before the company decides to split it. the average closing price over the three months prior to the last split announcement was 00NUMBER00. lets further assume generously given the size of the company and the fact that it pays a dividend that the stock will rise at an average annualized rate of 00NUMBER00 over coming years. under that scenario it would take roughly 00NUMBER00 years until the next split. reducing our return assumption to 00NUMBER00 extends the wait to nearly 00NUMBER00 years. personally ill be surprised if the next split occurs any sooner than fifteen years from now. however i hope i have convinced you that the prospect of a stock split isnt in itself something investors ought to devote any attention to. in fact the only way in which it is notable is the relationship to the progression of the stock price but the dependency only goes one way. in other words the stock split depends on price appreciation but durable price appreciation which is what matters is not influenced by stock splits. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david

smartphone market in the world but every little bit helps when youre trying to squeeze out growth in any way shape or form. applenasdaq aapl is now set to expand into indonesia after committing to a 00NUMBER00 million investment to open a new research and development rd center in the region over the next few years according to reuters. starting next year indonesia will implement a rule that requires all 00NUMBER00 smartphones to include at least 00NUMBER00 of local content but that requirement can be satisfied in a few ways. it can be hardware software or investments. with apples supply chain deeply entrenched in other regions the mac maker went with the latter route and recently earned a local content certification according to the report. the local sourcing requirement is similar to a law in india except that indias requirement pertains primarily to hardware components. apple is unable to meet the requirement as is despite its best efforts to be exempt under an exception for state of the art products. apple still has a lot of work to do in order to crack india which promises to be a massive smartphone market in the years ahead. last month indonesian government officials announced that apple would be opening an rd center in the indonesian capital of jakarta in 00NUMBER00. thats just the latest in a string of rd centers that the company is setting up across asia. again this isnt a particularly big market at the moment. there were roughly 00NUMBER00 million smartphone users in indonesia in 00NUMBER00 and quarterly unit sales are typically in the single digit millions according to emarketer. however emarketer expects the smartphone user base to jump to approximately 00NUMBER00 million by 00NUMBER00 so theres definitely some growth potential for the indonesian smartphone market which is already the third largest in the asia pacific region behind china and india. the indonesian smartphone market is still immature in many ways. network infrastructure remains an ongoing development and wider network access will help boost adoption. smartphone penetration is estimated at around 00NUMBER00 according to gsma intelligence. in mary meekers 00NUMBER00 internet trends report indonesia falls into a group of countries that have medium to high barriers to broader internet adoption due to challenges around incentives and infrastructure combined with mixed demographic trends. affordability has been a key driver of smartphone adoption which is obviously a hurdle for apple given its premium positioning. the average retail price of a smartphone in indonesia in 00NUMBER00 was just 00NUMBER00 per meekers estimates. gdp per capita in 00NUMBER00 was only about 00NUMBER00. idc released market share estimates for indonesia just this morning pegging samsung as the market leader with 00NUMBER00 market share. china based oppo came in no. 00NUMBER00 with 00NUMBER00 share followed by asus with 00NUMBER00. the market researcher notes that most of the growth is coming from the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 price segment of the market although entry level handsets in the 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 range are still the core part of the market. note that

from unit sales and product cycles toward recurring revenue sources like services and subscriptions. the iphone maker started highlighting non gaap financial metrics like installed base purchases which represented the gross value of digital content that users purchase in aggregate irrespective of how those purchases end up being accounted for on apples financial statements. interestingly apple didnt disclose this figurelast quarter but that could be more about the secs broader crackdown on non gaap metrics thats been going on all year. the company is still very much trying to highlight services growth noting the services business hit an all time record last quarter. heres ceo tim cook on the last earnings callwe had a record setting quarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 00NUMBER00 reaching 00NUMBER00 billion. app store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 00NUMBER00 thanks to the growing popularity of apple music. . . . we remain very confident about the future of our services business given the unmatched level of engagement satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. we have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years and as weve said before we expect it to be the size of a fortune 00NUMBER00 company in 00NUMBER00. for reference the bar to make it into the fortune 00NUMBER00 for 00NUMBER00 was about 00NUMBER00 billion and apples services revenue for fiscal 00NUMBER00 was 00NUMBER00 billion. longtime apple analyst gene munster is leaving piper jaffrayto pursue a new career in venture capital but the analyst is giving investors a parting research note. munster has similarly taken note of how apple has been trying to change investor perception but the analyst believes that services will need to comprise at least 00NUMBER00 of revenue before investors start to give it more credit. if apple wanted to be classified as a services company it would probably need to bring in half of revenue from services in munsters view. this percentage has been rising as apples services business grows but services comprised just 00NUMBER00 of sales last fiscal year. so apple still has a long way to go before investors start to give the segment any real respect at least if we go by munsters thresholds. apple will need to come up with many more services if it hopes to get there. apple pay is growing but the company has never really been too forthright about the mobile payment services economics. perhaps more importantly its really difficult to see a path toward services becoming this large in terms of the overall business simply because the iphone dominates apples financials. . . although in some contexts you could consider the iphone itselfas a service. i know what youre thinking the last thing we need is another as a service acronym and youre right. but hear me out. this isnt some new idea investors have long relied on ongoing upgrades as part of the apple thesis. but apples iphone upgrade program is the clearest attempt to create long term recurring revenue from annual upgrades in a structured way. apple outsources the financing of this program to citizens one so for the most part it recognizes the related revenue upfront net of a guarantee liability associated with the trade in right. but id argue that iphone upgrade program revenue could be considered a form of services revenue even though it shows up as iphone revenue. the applecare component of the iphone upgrade program is likely already being classified as service but you could effectively consider the hardware component recurring revenue too. that rationale would also apply to customers that participate in early upgrade and leasing programs offered by carriers which would shift the accounting to the carriers balance sheets. the point is that you could take a subset of iphone users that are committed to regular upgrades either through apple directly or via carrier programs and arguably consider those sales as service given the long term and recurring nature of the relationship. these data arent available but if you look at it this way services actually comprise a larger percentage than whats officially reported. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter

investors. the motley fool has a disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  when trying to predict the future most investors and wall street analysts like hard data. a forecast based on recent sales trends seems far more scientific than predictions based on rumored features of future products and guesses about what consumers really want. however extrapolating from sales trends has been a lousy strategy for predicting applesnasdaq aapl results. indeed sales of apples most important product the iphone have been extremely volatile in recent years. if there is one lesson that investors could learn from looking at iphone sales trends over the past five years its that they dont follow any regular pattern. fiscal yeariphone unit sales growthiphone revenue 00NUMBER00 source apple annual 00NUMBER00 k filings. five years ago the iphone was still a relatively new product. at that time the rising popularity of smartphones and the steady addition of new iphone wireless carrier partners was driving explosive growth. for apples 00NUMBER00 fiscal year unit sales and revenue for the iphone product line both surged more than 00NUMBER00. iphone sales growth cooled dramatically in the following two years. in fiscal 00NUMBER00 iphone unit sales rose just 00NUMBER00 while revenue increased 00NUMBER00. in a 00NUMBER00 article for quartz christopher mims noted that apple has stopped growing. mims claimed that new larger screened phones that were then rumored to be on the way mean theres still potential for incremental growth in apples revenue. but thats it. he couldnt have been more wrong. in the following year apples fiscal 00NUMBER00 iphone unit sales growth accelerated to 00NUMBER00. and thanks to higher prices for the new iphone 00NUMBER00 plus and rising customer demand for higher memory configurations iphone revenue surged 00NUMBER00. the iphone 00NUMBER00 drove incredible sales growth for apple two years ago. image source apple. in light of this strong momentum most analysts expected further iphone sales growth albeit more subdued growth in fiscal 00NUMBER00. they were wrong again. last year iphone unit sales slipped 00NUMBER00 year over year and revenue fell by double digits. wall street analysts dont expect iphone sales to continue sliding but they arent expecting much growth going forward either. not surprisingly there is a wide range of estimates but on average apple analysts expect mid single digit iphone sales growth over the next two years. after overestimating apples potential iphone sales for fiscal 00NUMBER00 analysts may have swung too far in the other direction now. as apples performance a few years ago showed last years sharp slowdown in iphone sales could still be followed by a return to strong growth in the future. most reviewers think that the iphone 00NUMBER00 doesnt have any must have features. image source apple. most reviewers agree that the iphone 00NUMBER00 isnt a big upgrade over iphone 00NUMBER00 series phones. there are new colors apple has bumped up the base storage to 00NUMBER00 gb and the headphone jack is gone but the exterior design and key components like the screen havent changed much. despite this relatively modest upgrade iphone sales seem to be on track to return to growth in the current 00NUMBER00 fiscal year. the explosive growth of the iphone user base over the last few years means that there are more iphone owners looking to upgrade than ever before. this seems to have offset the lack of a wow factor for the iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. looking ahead many industry observers expect apple to release a revolutionary new iphone designnext year to coincide with the iphones 00NUMBER00 anniversary. new features may include an all glass casing with no bezels wireless charging and curved oled screens. if these rumors prove to be accurate iphone sales could accelerate again as they did two years ago due to upgrade demand shifting into fiscal 00NUMBER00 from the adjacent years along with an uptick in android switching. will iphone sales grow 00NUMBER00 year over year again probably not but a year over year growth rate of around 00NUMBER00 is entirely plausible. while a few analysts on wall street recognize this possibility the vast majority have been scared away from making bold iphone sales growth projections after apples disappointing fiscal 00NUMBER00. however the volatility of apples iphone sales in the past few years shows that sales trends over the course of a year or even two offer very little guidance about what to expect in the future. investors shouldnt ignore the past but they shouldnt read too much into recent iphone sales trends either. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter they have run for

and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  on applesnasdaq aapl quarterly earnings call back in october ceo tim cook told investors that worldwide demand for iphone 00NUMBER00 and iphone 00NUMBER00 plus has significantly outpaced supply particularly on iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. image source apple. later during the call cook further clarified that although he expected apple to reach supply demand balance on the iphone 00NUMBER00 by the end of the current quarter he wasnt confident that the company would be able to do so with the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. based on a recent check of apples online store it looks as though apple is close to achieving supply demand balance on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. after launch the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus in jet black was extremely difficult to get ahold of which one analyst chalked up partlyto low manufacturing yields on the glossy finish of the device. three months later though if youd like to buy one apple can have it delivered to your doorstep in a matter of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 daysimage source applecom. similar delivery dates also apply to the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus models in other colors and capacities. the delivery dates quoted above tell us that apple close to achieving supply demand balance on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus. i wouldnt say that apple is atsupply demand balance though as an iphone 00NUMBER00 non plus ordered today per the apple online store can be expected to arrive the next day suggesting that apple has reached supply demand balance on the smaller iphone models. however its hard to draw many specific conclusions from this information. after all the supply demand equation is a function of two inputs supply anddemand. we know that demand has been greater than supply on the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus during the quarter but we dont know how many apple produced. if apple produced more iphone 00NUMBER00 plus units this year than it did iphone 00NUMBER00 plus units last year then apple may have enjoyed a nice tailwind to iphone average selling prices during the quarter potentially a positive for revenue. even then though there are a couple of scenarios that apple might be experiencing here. if iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand has increased year over year that demand might be a result of share gains within the premium large screen device market. alternatively increased iphone 00NUMBER00 plus demand might simply be coming at the expense of the smaller iphone 00NUMBER00. in that case apple should still benefit from a richer product mix if users dont move down a tier in capacity to move up to the plus but the unit shipment story would be less poised to benefit. based on cooks commentary it looks like apple was surprised by the relatively strong demand for the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus this time around. the signal that consumers appear to be giving apple is that they want innovative new features and theyre willing to pay for them. indeed the iphone 00NUMBER00 plus includes a dual lens camera that enables some interesting capabilities optical zoom depth of field and it sells for 00NUMBER00 more than the iphone 00NUMBER00. previous iphone plus models carried just a 00NUMBER00 premium over their standard iphone counterparts. i expect that apples future initial premium iphone build plans as well as its featurepricing strategies with respect to those future premium iphone models will incorporate the wealth of insights gleaned from this product cycle. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen.

walking dead the canadian based tech company just refuses to die. and its being resurrected in various forms including last weeks announced deal with tcl communication allowing tcl to design manufacture sell and provide customer support for blackberry branded mobile devices. exactly what blackberry which has ceded the hardware market to both apple aapl and samsung ssnlf hopes to achieve from this deal with tcl remains to be seen. on tuesday analysts are certain to press the management for details. for the quarter that ended november the company is expected to lost a penny per share on revenue 00NUMBER00 million. but theres only one metric in blackberrys business that matters operating margins from the software and services segment. why this is where ceo john chen has hitched the companys future. the margins produced by that segment will determine the strength of the companys future profits. said more bluntly its the only reason left to invest in this company. in the fiscal second quarter blackberry posted software and services gross margins of 00NUMBER00 million on 00NUMBER00 million in segment revenue. the 00NUMBER00 margin seems impressive indeed. but segment operating income was only 00NUMBER00 million or about 00NUMBER00 of revenue and down some 00NUMBER00 from the first quarter. the reason for the decline aside from lower sequential revenue second quarter segment operating expenses at 00NUMBER00 million ate into the companys profits. while the segment does generate higher margin services blackberry must prove it can grow that business profitably. and to do so segment revenue must rise while operating expenses decline. its simple math but its the only way to justify the shift and disruption chen has engineered in blackberrys overall business since being appointed ceo three years ago. regarding the deal with tcl blackberry gets to keep its name which still has a sizable fan base alive without the risk of making and selling it. its a smart move in the sense that blackberry will use tcl to either build a market for blackberry phones or merely maintain what market share it has left. blackberry says it will retain control and develop its security and software solutions while tcl focuses on the hardware. bottom line blackberry stands to lose nothing from this deal. but it can only win if profits margins from software and services which now accounts for more than a third of the total revenue rise too. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those

put contract and one interesting call contract from the october 00NUMBER00 expiration for aapl. the put contract our yieldboost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the 00NUMBER00 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of 00NUMBER00. collecting that bid as the premium represents a 00NUMBER00 return against the 00NUMBER00 commitment or a 00NUMBER00 annualized rate of return at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost. turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the october 00NUMBER00 expiration for shareholders of apple inc symbol aapl looking to boost their income beyond the stocks 00NUMBER00 annualized dividend yield. selling the covered call at the 00NUMBER00 strike and collecting the premium based on the 00NUMBER00 bid annualizes to an additional 00NUMBER00 rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at stock options channel refer to as the yieldboost for a total of 00NUMBER00 annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. any upside above 00NUMBER00 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but aapl shares would have to climb 00NUMBER00 from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 00NUMBER00 return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. top yieldboost aapl calls â»the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those

00NUMBER00 billion euros or 00NUMBER00 billion in unpaid taxes. the european commission had previously accused apple of accepting illegal state aid in addition to its tax arrangements in ireland where its european headquarters are located. ireland contested the original decision against apple saying the eu was interfering with its sovereignty. even the u. s. treasury said the eu was making itself a supra national tax authority that may jeopardize any future global tax reform efforts. its been clear since the start of this case there was a pre determined outcome. the commission took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules disregarding decades of irish tax law us tax law as well as global consensus on tax policy that everyone has relied on apple said. the brussels based commission however made a filing of its own disclosing more details of a two year investigation and reiterating its stance that ireland offered preferential tax treatment to apple which is illegal in the eu. it also pointed out specific irish tax practices like the matter of apple paying taxes on the profits its reported in ireland and sending money back to the u. s. to pay for research and development. an arrangement like this could be seen as a cost sharing agreement and could change apples tax status in ireland. margarethe vestager the eus commissioner for competition argued that the two tax rulings significantly reduced the amount of taxes paid by apple since 00NUMBER00. apple is apparently only paying a corporate tax rate of just 00NUMBER00 in ireland. ms. vestager has often argued that these special tax treatments harm companies that do not receive such advantages. according tobloomberg apple will officially have to pay back the takes within a matter of weeks though the money will be held in escrow. the appeals process could take several years to resolve. stocks that arent in the news…yetyou are invited to download the full up to the minute list of 00NUMBER00 zacks

inflection point right now. unit volumes are plunging just a year after applenasdaq aapl jumped in with apple watch. mainstream consumers arent really sold on the idea quite yet especially if they dont place much value on fitness oriented functionalities. maybe the enterprise can pick up the slackapple has now launched a new apple watch microsite dedicated to corporate wellness highlighting how companies can improve employee health with the wearable device. the site features a handful of health apps as well as productivity apps. the volume discounts appear to kick in at 00NUMBER00 employees at which point enterprise customers should contact apple directly. companies with less than 00NUMBER00 employees are told to just visit an apple store. this comes just a couple months after apple scored a major apple watch winwith aetna which now offers apple watch to its 00NUMBER00 employees as part of its own corporate wellness program. on top of that aetna will help subsidize the device for several large employers that it works with. its somewhat uncharacteristic of apple to target the enterprise and the company has only really been actively catering to the enterprise for a couple of years now. the mac maker has never really liked appealing to a purchasing manager or high level exec thats responsible for buying in bulk. it would rather sell directly to individual users. that being said apple is always happy to have the business even if the enterprise historically hasnt been a priority. thats also a challenge particularly when youre asking consumers to adopt a new product category. sure its nice if a company buys employees apple watches but that doesnt necessarily mean theyll usethem. and much of apples business is predicated on customer satisfaction driving ongoing hardware upgrades over time. a corporate wellness win could produce a spike in apple watch unit sales but that hardly ensures the customer will jump on the upgrade track. in the u. s. alone companies spend an estimated 00NUMBER00 billion per year on corporate wellness programs according to ibisworld. this market will only expand as companies seek to reduce healthcare costs even with uncertainty surrounding the fate of obamacare. grabbing part of that market would certainly help but it takes a lot to move the needle for a 00NUMBER00 billion business. ceo tim cook recently attempted to assuage

opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  image source apple. for years india has been a headache for applenasdaq aapl. the challenges are aplenty but one central hurdle has always been a local sourcing regulation that requires companies to source 00NUMBER00 of products value from within the countrys borders in order to set up retail stores. apple previously and unsuccessfullytried to get an exemption from the requirement which are sometimes available to state of the art and cutting edge products. the idea of apple manufacturing its products in india is nothing new but apple is seriously considering it now according to the wall street journal. the news comes about a month after apple reportedly asked the indian government for various types of incentives should it move forward with manufacturing in india. manufacturing products in india should allow apple to meet the local sourcing requirement potentially paving the way for the company to open its iconic apple stores. it would potentially also represent a reversal from may when ceo tim cook said apple had no intention of setting up a manufacturing facility in india. its hard to overstate just how important apple stores are to the company. the retail stores have long been an important differentiator for apple vertically integrating distribution in a way that few competitors pursue. in doing so apple can exert greater control over the purchasing experience as well as provide after purchase support. there are also ample opportunities to cross sell customers on complementary products. all of this strengthens the brand. currently the vast majority of smartphones in india are sold by local resellers and retailers that carry a wide range of brands. such a fragmented distribution system simply cant provide consistent experiences across the board. unlike the prospect of manufacturing in the u. s. which apple dabbles in to a small degree mostly for political purposes expanding manufacturing to india is relatively reasonable. labor costs are low and india is still within fairly close proximity to apples long list of asia based component suppliers. primary manufacturing partner foxconn has already been rumored to be exploring a 00NUMBER00 billion to 00NUMBER00 billioninvestment in india. whats less clear is whether or not the indian labor pool has the vocational kind of skills that apple needs. even if apple were to start manufacturing in india and subsequently open apple stores theres no shortage of other issues that apple faces in trying to crack the worlds third largest smartphone market. for starters indian carriers dont subsidize smartphones. while the subsidy model has mostly died in the u. s. that transition was made possible by replacing subsidies with leasing and installment plans. lacking subsidies and abundant financing options combined with lower income levels apples premium positioning makes it a tough sell. the average retail price of a smartphone in india was just 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00. lte coverage also has a long way to go. a mere 00NUMBER00 of indias population had lte coverage in 00NUMBER00 coverage is expected to jump to 00NUMBER00 over the next five years. the indian market will remain challenging for apple for the foreseeable future but given the long term importance of india to the global smartphone market apple has to take it seriously. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it

that applenasdaq aapl actually manufactures in the u. s. and its not just final assembly that takes place stateside either apple even makes other components like the metal chassis for the professional desktop here in the u. s. when the company unveiled the new is it a trash can or a jet engine design in 00NUMBER00 it made sure to point out the shift in manufacturing. at the time like now apple was on the receiving end of criticism regarding its use of asian contract manufacturers abroad although the mac pro facility is operatedby singapore based contract manufacturer flextronics. ceo tim cook tweeted about itwatching the mac pro come together in austin yesterdaythanks to a team loaded with american manufacturing expertise. pic. 00NUMBER00 made a marketing video about itit was a big deal at the time even if mostly symbolic. apple earned some political goodwill in the process while minimizing the financial impact by choosing one of its lowest volume and most expensive products to make at home. heres the thing apple would still probably prefer to kill off its u. s. manufacturing. in a recent bloombergreport by mark gurman discussing the broader state of the mac some light has been shed on some of the challenges that have plagued the mac pro and its domestic production. behind the scenes mac pro manufacturing suffered from a few operational bottlenecks. for example apple had to create its own manufacturing tooling equipment and then train workers on operating the machines in order to construct the glossy chassis. while investing in customized tooling infrastructure is nothing new for apple and comprises the bulk of its capital expenditures which are expected to soar to a mind boggling 00NUMBER00 billionnext fiscal year the real kicker is this snippet from the report emphasis added because of the earlier challenges some apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to asia where its cheaper and manufacturers have the required skillsfor ambitious products according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. this underscores a key reason that underpins apples preference of manufacturing in asia. sure labor costs are lower but the mac maker has long noted that there is a dearth of mid level manufacturing engineers with the right skill sets in the u. s. just because apple would like to kill off its u. s. manufacturing due to both operational and financial considerations that doesnt mean it will. this is particularly true given president elect donald trumps heavy emphasis on u. s. manufacturing on the campaign trail. we also know that trump is vaguely offering incentivesto apple with the hopes of bringing some of those jobs back a similar strategy that the president elect used with carrier parent united technologiesa few weeks ago. theres far more political pressure now than there was in 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 to create domestic manufacturing jobs. so while apple and its investors would still rather keep manufacturing in asia the company still has to seriously entertain the idea of making iphones in america. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david

2016-12-22 00:00:00,AAPL,1,1.2015197924427916,0.2147498919945419,0.0004805440095827,applenasdaq aapl isnt the growth stock it used to be. with over 00NUMBER00 billion of revenue per year twice as much as five years ago top line growth simply doesnt come as easily for the company anymore. but along with lower growth potential comes more excess cash for shareholders which can be paid out in dividends. this has turned apple into quite the dividend stock. indeed apple arguably now shines just as brightly as a dividend investment as it did a growth investment five years ago. to show just how strong of a dividend stock apple is consider how the tech giants payout could very well double in just seven years. image source getty images. when apple initiated a quarterly payout in 00NUMBER00 the company instantly became a major dividend player. with a cash hoard that had ballooned to over 00NUMBER00 billion and its 00NUMBER00 billion in annual free cash flow at the time apple was a strong choice for income investors despite lacking dividend history. but the four years that have passed since then have provided more insight into what dividend investors might expect next from apple. in particular apple has proven to be a great contender for long term dividend growth. during this short period apple has increased its dividend every year averaging an annualized increase of about 00NUMBER00. further management has explicitly declared an annual dividend increase to be a priority for the company. the company also plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis apple said in a 00NUMBER00 press release about its dividend increase that year. and management has continued to emphasize its commitment to annual increases. but can the tech behemoth continue delivering dividend increases as it faces headwinds with growing its businessa quick overview of apples annual dividend payments as a percentage of its earnings and cash flow suggests it can. as it turns out apple is only paying out a small portion of its annual free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures in dividends. in the past 00NUMBER00 months for instance apples free cash flow was an impressive 00NUMBER00 billion. yet during this same period the tech giant paid out just 00NUMBER00 billion in dividends. similarly its currently paying out only 00NUMBER00 of its annual net income. apple store. image source the motley fool. clearly the company still has considerable room to continue increasing its dividend. indeed it would be realistic for it to maintain the annual increase rate it has averaged for the past four years into the foreseeable future. and an average 00NUMBER00 annual hike would double apples dividend in just seven years. this analysis illustrates how powerful dividend growth can be over time. while investors who buyapple stocktoday will get a dividend yield of just 00NUMBER00 its very possible its annual dividend payments seven years from now will amount to 00NUMBER00 of its stock price today. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter they

investors. the motley fool has a disclosure policy. the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc.  one financial metric that matters to investors is the ratio of operating expenses to revenue. the lower this is the arguably more efficient a company is with its spending. during applesnasdaq aapl meteoric rise in the wake of the successes of the iphone and to a lesser extent ipad the companys operating expense to revenue ratio bottomed at sub 00NUMBER00. image source ycharts. that nadir came even as the companys investments in research and development rd and sales general and administrative expenses sga multiplied in the span of a decade apples revenue growth was just thatfast. image source ycharts. apples operating expense efficiency is still best in class among its peers but as apples growth slows and the costs to build next generation products rise that efficiency is clearly eroding. though some of the decreased efficiency in apples spending is clearly attributable to a natural inflation in product development costs a recent piece published in bloombergsuggests that the companys fundamental product development methodology has become less efficient over time. as youll see shortly part of the decline in apples rd efficiency may be due to the company taking steps to minimize the risks associated with developing technically challenging new products. in recent years apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time writes bloombergs mark gurman. he further goes on to quote a person familiar with the matter as having said that apples engineers are asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable. as a concrete example gurman reports that apple tested two primary prototypes for the 00NUMBER00 inch macbook that launched back in early 00NUMBER00 a heavier one and a lighter one. in the end apple shipped the laptop in 00NUMBER00 months after its 00NUMBER00 goal gurman said. this appears to be an example of apple trading rd efficiency for risk mitigation apple presumably had to pour more rd dollars into developing the two prototypes rather than just going all in on one version. and to top it all off the money and effort spent on the model that didnt get shipped goes totally down the drain. if apple spends those kinds of resources on such risk mitigation efforts on the mac roughly 00NUMBER00 of apples revenue then the amount that apple probably spends on developing multiple iphone models apples revenue and profit depend heavily on the iphone product line is likely mind boggling. apple is the largest technology in the world by market capitalization as of this writing and easily the most profitable. it pays a hefty dividend too. its practically the very definitionof a blue chip stock. as such a company it needs to be very responsible in the risks that it takes. with the iphone product lineup apple must release new phones each fall with little margin for error. this means that if the company wants to try crazy new things that might not pan out in time for release it had better have several lower risk options in the works as well. by having those alternative fallback options apple is doing what it can to minimize the risk of potential show stoppers that could substantially impact revenue and operating profits. in return though apple needs to spend more on product development than it would otherwise without such a safety net in place. but at least to this fool that safety net is well worth the price. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a

indices for years as its fundamental business performance continued to dazzle. image source apple. indeed the company struck virtual gold with its iphone product line revolutionizing the mobile phone market and indeed the computing market as we know it. and investors who got in early could have made fortunes. however over the last couple of years apple has transformed from a hot growth stock to a mature megacap technology stock that pays a solid dividend and routinely shrinks its share count through stock buybacks. for many risk averse investors a proven company like apple is exactly the kind of stock that theyre looking for. that said even a highly profitable industry leader like apple carries investment risks. lets take a closer look at a couple of those risks. in apples most recent fiscal year it generated approximately 00NUMBER00 billion in revenue from sales of its iphone product line out of a company total of 00NUMBER00 billion. thats more than 00NUMBER00 of the companys revenue base coming from a single product line. there are all kinds of risks associated with having this much exposure to the smartphone market. for one thing the market itself has cooled off quite a bit. market research company idc predicts that the smartphone market will grow at a 00NUMBER00 compounded annual growth rate from 00NUMBER00 through 00NUMBER00. the smartphone market no longer seems to be a high growth one. next apple has been having a hard time even growing with the market. in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple saw its iphone unit sales dropeven in a market that expanded implying market share loss. there are many potential explanations for why apples iphone business performed so poorly that year but suffice it to say if this market share loss continues it could be tough on apples financial performance longer term. apple has certainly been investing in trying to grow out non iphone businesses. it has put a lot of effort into its ipad line of tablet computers it introduced the apple watch line of smartwatches not too long ago and it has been investing heavily in building out its services business with products like apple music apple pay as well as continued growth from its app store. in fiscal year 00NUMBER00 apple saw growth from its other products apple says this includes sales of apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and apple branded third party accessories and its services apple explains that this includes revenue from internet services applecare apple pay licensing and other services. however its iphone ipad and mac businesses all declined in that fiscal year. apple is certainly onto something with its services business and theres a chance that apple watch could be a long term hit but finding significant sustained growth outside of its core iphonemacipad businesses isnt likely to be easy. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the

cook giddily opening that new lego batman set hes been asking for. the mac makers activation servers were working overtime as all those gifted iphones and ipads were turned on for the first time. flurry analyticsestimates that apple grabbed an impressive 00NUMBER00 of mobile device activations from dec. 00NUMBER00 to dec. 00NUMBER00. more than double the 00NUMBER00 that samsunggrabbed over the same time frame. huawei ranked no. 00NUMBER00 with 00NUMBER00 of activations and lgs 00NUMBER00 earned it the no. 00NUMBER00 spot. this year hanukkah and christmas had an overlap with hanukkah starting on dec. 00NUMBER00. flurrys estimates cover the week leading up to christmas as well as the first two nights of the jewish holiday. image source flurry analytics. the analytics specialist also notes that huawei and lg were able to earn their respective spots through sheer volume. both companies offer a plethora of different devices including low cost models that collectively boosted each manufacturers rankings. neither huawei nor lg had a specific model rank particularly highly. the ongoing trend toward large devices and phablets is only gaining momentum. you may recall all the pressure that was on apple circa 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 to come out with a bigger iphone to which apples initial response was to launch an entire marketing campaign about one handed use. 00NUMBER00 push into phablet territory with the iphone 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 plus not only created a massive upgrade cycle for apple but also validated and acceleratedthe shifting consumer preference. you can see in flurrys estimates how phablets are taking over flurry technically only considers the plus models as phablets. note the big jump from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00. image source flurry analytics. phablets are here to stay. while apples activations are a good sign theyre slightly less than last year when apple grabbed 00NUMBER00 of device activations. and last year hanukkah was in early

apple is still the top manufacturer by a healthy margin in terms of holiday device activations the companys iphone sales this quarter are very much in question right now. there have been plenty of

had a difficult time avoiding the media. while he refrained from providing any updates on the company he did say the companys airpods have been a runaway success according to a cnbc tweet. airpods. image source apple. after they finally launched on dec. 00NUMBER00 over three months after they were first unveiled the company quickly sold out of them. based on cooks comments on wednesday high demand seems to be at least part of the reason. cook says the company is making airpods as fast as it can as apple aims to catch production up with demand. the companys website currently says customers who order in the u. s. today will have to wait six weeks before their airpods ship. the apparent success of apples airpods probably wont have a meaningful impact on the tech giants financial results even if apple were to catch supply up to demand. with over 00NUMBER00 billion in annual revenue its unlikely the 00NUMBER00 product can materially affect results especially early in its product life cycle. for perspective airpods cost only a fraction of the companys average selling price for its iphones of about 00NUMBER00 and apple is selling over 00NUMBER00 million iphones per year. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley

by now investors should always take sell side research notes with a grain of salt or more and they should never act solely based on said research reports. sell side analyst opinions are but one of many factors that investors should incorporate into investing decisions. ironically thats the takeaway thats underscored in. . . a recent sell side research report from ubs. according to the report via business insider applenasdaq aapl actually ranks as the most underweightholding among global fund managers. all around the world fund managers are allocating less of their portfolios to apple than their respective benchmark indexes suggesting that the buy side doesnt have a whole lot of confidence in the mac makers ability to outperform the broader market. meanwhile sell side ratings and price targets are generally quite bullish with mostly buy ratings and price targets that are well above current prices representing significant upside if shares can actually get there. consider the fact that analyst price targetson apple go as high as 00NUMBER00 but average out around 00NUMBER00. with shares currently trading at around 00NUMBER00 and change those estimates represent potential upside of 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 respectively. so what givesnot all sell side analysts are created equal even if their estimates are included in the consensus forecasts. for example that street high price target of 00NUMBER00 comes from drexel hamilton analyst brian white. over the years white has covered apple at several wall street firms but almost always maintained the highest price target on the street. white also seemingly has a fondness for repeating numbers. at various times in the past he has previously assigned price targets pre split of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00. white has a pretty mixed track record in terms of predictions. perhaps the most confounding was the iring that he predicted in 00NUMBER00 that would accompany an apple tv set as an interface play that would revolutionize the tv experience forever. while white is an extreme example both for some of his outlandish predictions over the years as well as his presumed fixation with having the street high price target at all times the bigger point is that the buy side isnt easily swayed by overly bullish forecasts. even piper jaffrays gene munster who is generally well regarded within the apple investment community has made his fair share of incorrect calls over the years. munster is leaving piper to pursue a career in venture capital but most recently assigned a price target of 00NUMBER00 which his successor analyst michael olson is maintaining. additionally keep in mind that the buy side and the sell side have completely different incentive structures which may contribute to the disconnect in sentiment the buy side hopes to deliver investment returns ideally outperformance to underlying shareholders earning management fees while the sell side hopes to attract the buy side to trade through the brokerage typically generating unscrupulous soft dollarrevenue. if you wanted to be a real skeptic you could also allege that sell side analysts also hope to earn a covered companys goodwill with positive coverage which might win some investment banking business despite the presence of the chinese wall. beyond product based predictions price targets and other financial forecasts are also highly subjective. price targets are often derived from discounted cash flow models and then peer based comparative valuation multiples are subsequently applied. sometimes a sum of the parts sotp analysis is used. even if the revenue estimates prove accurate theres really no way for analysts to gauge investor sentiment which directly affects what valuation multiples the market will assign to shares. simply put if the buy side lacks faith in apples ability to grow from these levels then the market will naturally gravitate toward lower multiples than perhaps sell siders are assigning in their price targets and investment ratings. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the newsletter

final inspection in china. image source apple. domestic manufacturing and the related jobs was one of the pillars of president elect donald trumps campaign. following his victory nearly two months ago the pressure is now on to deliver to his voters and supporters even if most of the reasons whyu. s. manufacturing has declined are out of his control. applenasdaq aapl is and has always been an easy political target given its sheer size and the fact that its common knowledge that iphones are assembled in china. trump has vaguely offered apple incentivesto bring manufacturing jobs back and while apple and foxconn are consideringthe idea there are many hurdles that are arguably impossible to overcome. if anything the company would likely rather kill u. s. manufacturingif it could including its last vestige of domestic assembly the mac pro. a couple of recent reports further underscore why apple would be unable to bring iphone production stateside at least in any meaningful way beyond small political gestures like the mac pro was which is already a financial and operational headache for the company. trump may tout that hes the most tremendous dealmaker in the observable universe butthe new york times just published a must read investigative report today detailing how china wooed foxconn and by proxy apple with incentives worth billions of dollars. the local government in zhengzhou offers a wide range of ongoing incentives that support foxconns iphone manufacturing facility in the city that churns out half a million iphones daily earning zhengzhou the nickname of iphone city. approximately half of all iphones are made in the city. iphones arent the only apple products assembled in china. image source apple. the details were discovered through confidential government records that the timesgot a hold of. apple says it knows that the government provides some level of support but says it doesnt know the specifics surrounding the incentives that foxconn has scored. heres a key sentence in the report that might rain on trumps parade as the zhengzhou operation shows china not only provides a large pool of labor it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the united states or anywhere else. a separate report from qqviadigitimes yesterday points out that even if apple and foxconn wanted to move manufacturing to the u. s. in any non trivial sense many of the suppliers and component manufacturers would not be willing to follow suit. its well known that the global consumer electronics supply chain is heavily concentrated in asia with manufacturing and assembly being but part of the value chain. a map of apples suppliers by geography. all those asian suppliers arent moving halfway across the world. image source apple. for these smaller companies the prospect of expanding in the u. s. would be prohibitively expensive due to higher labor costs operating costs and regulatory costs given the u. s. s more stringent environmental regulations. there are also concerns around the demographics of the labor pool with chinese workers typically being younger than their u. s. counterparts. one of the key benefits of assembling in china is the close proximity to suppliers which dramatically simplifies operations and reduces logistics costs. it also allows for flexibility to tweak and adapt manufacturing processes as challenges arise. so dont expect apple to start bringing those jobs back en masse. sorry trump. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can

to bring back at least someof its manufacturing jobs from overseas. beyond overtures from president elect donald trump himself his victory in november shows a resurgence of a nationalist mentality across large swaths of the u. s. population. the company is now tasked with navigating an increasingly complex political landscape while balancing its financial and operational needs including the massive globalized supply chain infrastructure that it has built over the years. apple cant just come out and say no even if it wants to. yesterday the new york timespublished a thorough investigative reporton zhengzhou china known as iphone city. its a great read for apple investors but if you read between the lines you may notice the possibility that apple could be subtly pushing back on the current political pressures. one of the ways that apple has changed under ceo tim cook is that it is much more engaged with the media. trading access for positive coverage is one of the oldest tricks in the media playbook and apple long played this game in spades under jobs. but cook implemented a major shift in communications strategy hoping to make apple more approachable. while jobs used to hog the spotlight apple now regularly grants executive interviews with media outlets. even if outright positive coverage isnt part of the deal companies also often grant access in order to have at least some influence on the direction or tone of a story. thats why it jumped out to me that coo jeff williams was quoted directly in the report. i was impressed williams said when discussing the early evolution of apples partnership with foxconn. they were very focused. its a tiny snippet just seven words but thats not the point. the point is that apple made williams available and in exchange was potentially able to have a say in how its china operations were portrayed. for the most part the report is mostly descriptive detailing the wide range of incentives that foxconn scored to set up shop on apples behalf as well as just how complex and developed the whole operation is. you get a sense that this is a massive machine that hums along churning out one of the worlds most popular products at mind boggling volumes because it is. the tone is almost reverential. compare that to the harshly accusatory tone that the timestook in 00NUMBER00 in its ieconomyseries for which the publication won a pulitzer price for in 00NUMBER00. for instance even the headlines alone for some of the parts were fiercely criticalin china human costs are built into an ipadhow apple sidesteps billions in global taxesapples retail army long on loyalty but short on payif the headlines were that damning you can only imagine how negatively the articles themselves portrayed apple. you should read the whole series if you havent already. note that the reporter for yesterdays story david barboza contributed to the ieconomy series. this is conjecture on my part but it seems quite possible to me that apple was able to favorably sway the tone of the report by contributing to it and granting executive access. there was no discussion about human rights concerns which used to be an easy weakness to call out even though apple has made progress on that front since 00NUMBER00. theres some discussion of tax avoidance near the end but that part is mostly more of the same. apple is extremelythoughtful deliberate and intelligent when it comes to influencing the media so its hard to chalk it up to coincidence. thats especially relevant if the takeaway is that apples manufacturing infrastructure is simply too massive and entrenched to move anywhere else. that fact may be obvious to most investors but promoting the public perception via a high profile report at a reputable media outlet that this is true could relieve a tiny bit of that political pressure. 00NUMBER00 stocks we like better than apple when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. after all the
